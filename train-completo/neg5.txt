What? What cereal gave away RCT?!            That explains it. Although Kelloggs are now giving away personalised spoons instead, which seems to be a far more banal version of the same thing.   Growing up in the UK, this was a standard in almost any cereal box, Kelloggs, Nestle or otherwise. Where have they all gone?                                                                                                                  Have also ingested while egesting.

 Favorite ones to use are Mechanical Animals and Eat Me, Drink Me both by Marilyn Manson. The guitar solos in Eat Me, Drink Me are just perfect for bringing in your partner close, biting into the neck as you thrust inside. I find the album a bit romantic.   From California, US SOADFreak211 Hopefully we can get some legendary items!   I can't be the only one that was looking at her health bar to see if it was going lower.......right?   Smart man, no one wants to fight someone who's naked   Anyone else notice the guy in the back tapping his foot along with the woman bouncing up and down??   Wow, very nice. You have a great body, now I can't sleep either   Made me cry too; not available in my country :(  	7
 Let the Free Market decide!   Let the Free Market decide!     Let the Free Market decide!   See above.   We all know this has nothing to do with "safety."  Oral surgery has a greater complication rate than surgical abortion. Yet somehow these restrictions weren't placed on oral surgeons (or ANY other outpatient facilities that perform such minor surgeries.) Only women's health clinics were targeted. There's no requirement for double-wide swinging doors to accommodate hospital gurneys in oral surgery facilities, for example, nor will there ever be.  This is direct, blatant, selective, and persecutive legislation by the Texas government against women's medical facilities and obstetricians performing federally legal procedures.  How many cases of cervical/uterine/breast cancer will now go undetected because of these regressive laws? How many women will die from ectopic pregnancies because they didn't have access to basic women's health care? How quickly will cases of sexually transmitted diseases expand and multiply because no testing or treatment was available? How many women will lose their only access to affordable birth control?  This entire "But... but... *it's for the womens' safety!*" charade has never been anything but a damnable lie. But you already knew that.    May Texas go Blue sooner rather than later.    Personally.... I would want the chance to live.  You'd never have known the difference.  Call me crazy for being pro life.  And you'd probably think crazy those who view "life" as more of a non-commutable sentence of unceasing suffering ending in inevitable death than as a "gift" or a "blessing."    In other news, Ben Carson won a straw poll.   We all know this has nothing to do with "safety."  Oral surgery has a greater complication rate than surgical abortion. Yet somehow these restrictions weren't placed on oral surgeons (or ***ANY*** other outpatient facilities that perform such minor surgeries.) Only women's health clinics were targeted. There's no requirement for double-wide swinging doors to accommodate hospital gurneys in oral surgery facilities, for example, nor will there ever be.  This is direct, blatant, selective, and persecutive legislation by the Texas government against women's medical facilities and obstetricians performing federally legal procedures.

How quickly will cases of sexually transmitted diseases expand and multiply because no testing or treatment was available? How many women will lose their only access to affordable birth control?  This entire "But... but... *it's for the womens' safety!*" bit has never been anything but a damnable lie.    And then a state-forced three-day waiting period.   Still, there are many like him who actually believe such tripe.   Is there no end to the Duggary?   And we're going in first unless they are halted.   "LIBERTY!"^TM strikes again.   Ralph Nader was a multiple stroke victim who wasn't even on the ballot in all states, thus making a win *mathematically impossible.*  Nader's vanity campaign didn't draw even 4% in *ANY* state, but still he insisted on campaigning ***almost exclusively*** in swing states where polling was within the margin of error.  Are those facts relevant enough for you?   TIL tadpoles are frogs.   Multiple stroke victim Nader's hopeless, useless, self-aggrandizing "BOTH SIDES ARE TEH SAME!!1!" vanity/fantasy campaign sentenced America and the world to the hell of Bush/Cheney.  Denying the reality of it doesn't make it go away.   Tell that to the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens who were Naderized.   But... but... *life begins at conception!*  /s   The parasite attaches to the uterine wall. Were you by any chance home-schooled?   If you want to be surrounded by sycophants, go to freerepublic, fox, redstate, or breitbart.  I'm sorry this forum doesn't regurgitate your worldview for you. The lack of affirmation is clearly very troublesome to your psyche.   Well, if it's a *legitimate* rape...   I guess the woman's body just has a way of shutting that whole thing down.   It's simple: the forced-birthers clearly don't give a damn about either mother or child after launch. Can anyone realistically argue otherwise, given their constant, consistent contempt for any/all programs to assist these post-fetal Americans?  Nope. Almost instantaneously, the women and their newborns become "welfare queens" and "welfare brats" (who don't even deserve enough in SNAP assistance to keep them alive.)  The fetus fetishists certainly don't give a shit about "honoring a Culture of Life" after launch, do they? Hiding hatred of women behind a cloak of "morality" is the exquisitely cruel SOP of the American Right.    concern troll is concerned   Based on his facial expressions, I'd wager it's up there a lot of the time already.   And its first birthday party at the age of three months!    I don't personally believe first trimester is murder, but they do  Do they really believe that? They *say* they do, but I don't think they really do.   It's just a convenient way to justify their regressive politics, as they know they can't say publicly what they *really* feel about women.   At least he'll be able to perform exorcisms on his fellow inmates.   Right-wing extremists just can't kick their craving for Koch.   Yet more contempt for women from the American Right.      So Rand Paul has moved from plagiarism to straight-out fabrication?   As if the Republicans will give a shit.   No one cares what Rand Paul thinks about anything.   If it weren't for guns and fetuses, what would Republicans obsess over?   Walker is not pro life. He is pro birth.  Walker is "forced birth."    a mostly form child   How is babby formed?    How is a parasite an "unborn baby"?  Thanks for playing, Mr. Wizard.   What accounts for the strange, obsessive fascination that Republicans/the American Right has with lady-parts?   Privatize the profits, socialize the losses!     Rand Pau's son William gets to assault flight attendants and get into drunken crashes.   it all goes back to that time as a kid when he was beaten senseless with a pool noodle   if accuracy is the goal, yes, absolutely.   orchestral manuvres in the park   That somersault was worthy of a Bundy Ranch "tacticool" wanna-be.    the man that reached into his waste band  ew     in case of general discharge, see a doctor   The somersault was Reno 911-worthy.    I obey badgers.  BUILD US A DAM     all because grover's dad stole his ice cream...   This is "LIBERTY!"^TM and "FREEDOM!"^TM Koch Brothers style.   Oh look... a one day-old, -100 account.   It's a food product, essentially.   It's almost like that time Cincinnati was bombed with turkeys.   Nader needs to become a "shutthefuckupandgoaway"-ist.   I wonder what Bob Dole thinks about all of these goings-on in Kansas?   *This Governorship sponsored by Kansas-based Koch Industries*   When you shoot with Cruz you lose!   Because the potential for comedy is enormous?   Based on their actions, the American Right believes psychopathy is a virtue.      Good. Someone needs to fight the GOP scammers and fraudsters.   How many of them are running now?   Why would Hillary ever debase herself so?   By being hateful, judgmental toolbags?   Fox News: Where you'll believe whatever the fuck we say!   Right-wing domestic terrorists.    It's amazing to me how the American Right defends the Duggary.   But ... but ... DELEGATES!  How else will they get to PaulFest?   When will this vulgar, vulgar woman go away?   *Shamu's Secret Shame*   ABC has, but the title over there precludes the rules of submission for this subreddit.      Oh so "pro-life."   Shitty website is shitty. Zerohedge is a joke.  It's big among the Ron Paul/Mises/Rothbard/Rockwell crowd.   "zerohedge" haha   Rand wasn't able to "defeat the American Machine" because his drunken son crashed it into a parked car.   The Hastert Rule: 18 year-olds might as well be Senior Citizens.   What is it with these right-wingers and their Duggaring of children?    Why do Republicans need to attack any of our universities?  Because an educated populace is the American Right's natural enemy.     Republicans are authoritarians, despite all the "FREEDOM!"^TM AND "LIBERTY!"^TM bullshit.  They only hate the "damn Gub'mint" when they are not in complete control of it.   "Please remember to spay or neuter your Duggars."   Josh Duggar was 15 when he started Duggaring his 5-year-old sister.  Stop making excuses for him.   or protecting the family's income stream.   I think those are his protective Bears.   Holy crap   I wonder if a properly-certified ophthalmologist could help Rand correct his "dark vision"?   When will Kansas wake?   A warning to all Republicans on the clown car: if Josh Duggar asks you to sit on his lap so he can tell you a story, ***don't do it.***   The information needs to be out there showing that the family cared more about the image of the family than the actual family members.  Even more basic: they cared about preserving their revenue stream.   Again, this perpetuates the American Right's oft-spread *"Social Security is going bankrupt!1!11!one!!1!"* lie.  Let's be clear: the Right's goal is to undo the 20th century and return us to the late 19th century, the age of the Robber Barons. That's not a future to which any nation should aspire.    maple syrup molesting racist  I don't think I've ever heard this particular allegation leveled. It sounds like a sticky situation. Any details?     Do they really have a choice? Are they willing to risk exile from the family, having had no real education, out into a world from which they've been deliberately sheltered for their entire lives? How would they support themselves? Where would they go?  "She who troubleth her own house shall inherit the wind."    received professional counseling.  I'll bet it was some hokey pseudo-Christian "pray away your brother's play" outfit.     He was helping them keep their quivers full.   I think people like to stand behind the Duggars because it helps prevent them from being Duggared themselves.   Rand tried to "defeat the Washington machine," but before he had a chance his son William got drunk and crashed it.   Megan Kelly's opening question: "Jim Bob, Michelle  how are you dealing with the liberal media's savage, relentless attacks on your family?"   It's really scary how Duggar fans are all over the Internet trying to explain away Josh's actions.   They study it out and train them up!  (Blanket not optional.)    who later claimed homosexuality leads to pedophilia.  Since by that time he certainly knew he was engaging in pedophilia with his sisters, I wonder if this "homosexuality leads to pedophilia" belief is an implied confession to Duggaring his brothers, too?  This case gets stranger each day.      Multigenerational Duggary?    And they did talk to a cop about it.  Yeeaaaah, about that cop... he was a family friend who is now serving a 50+ year sentence for collecting/distributing child porn.  It really astounds me the lengths to which people will go to continue defending the Duggary...       #***SOCIALISTS!!!1!11!***   Ask the Duggars what's wrong with *them.*   The Duggary apologists sicken me.   Josh's sisters sure didn't.     Ugh, quite the contrary.   Yet more Duggary unveiled.   or excitement   The report details that Josh went from sister to sister, stating, Apparently all of the girls were sleeping in a common room at this time.  Imagine those poor Duggar girls lying there awake while they pretended to be asleep, waiting their "turn," powerless to stop their brother Josh from molesting their sisters right in front of the others, wondering what age he'd start on the next one, knowing that they were going to be the next one forced to lift their wrinkled nightshirt so Josh could poke and probe and prod and squeeze wherever he pleased with his sweaty, trembling fingers     and all the time knowing that ***it must all be hidden***, first, to protect the family, second because they were allowed no contact with those outside the sect, and third because no one would ever believe them anyway, instead calling them temptresses and liars and sluts and whores who had brought utter disgrace to the family and destroyed the family's means of support with their foul lies . . .    The "stern lecture" family friend-cop Jim Bob and Josh talked to years after the Duggary occurred is now in prison himself, serving 50+ years for possession/distribution of child porn.  Model citizens.   I thought JimBob said God's law was greater than the law of man.  Well, it's different if you really, really, *really* want to bone your sisters.   Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar just told their daughters to pray Josh's play away.   FADE IN  *[Duggar Family gathers around dining table and all sit. Joe Bob begins to say grace, but his oldest son Josh Duggar interrupts him.]*  JOSH:  Dad, I'm your son. There's something you need to know. I'm a Duggar.  And, boy I really dug her  and her, her, her, and her, too!"   *[points to various siblings around table]*  [cut to zoom-in on Joe Bob Duggar's face, a "Home Alone"-like reaction of shock and surprise.]  *[Boingy Spring SFX, followed by Sad Trombone]*  END SCENE   Ooh, ooh, a "very dark plan!"  Please share the details.   What is, as you call it, the "transgender agenda"?   Ron Paul fears a lot of things.   And?   Does he also believe in the freedom to drive drunk?  Rand's son William Paul sure does. Also, there's his freedom to assault flight attendants.   **"I have heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines."**   *** Rand Paul***    Don't forget "LIBERTY!"^TM    And many acts of Duggary were committed!   Yes, I bet Josh Duggar's sides hurt from laughing.  The sister-victims Josh diddled? Not so much.    The European states are also much smaller geographically, much smaller in population, and much more homogenous ethnically and linguistically.  This is one of the most trusty dog-whistles of the American Right. Translated, it means "what works quite well over there won't work at all over here, because minorities."  At least be honest about the use of the statement.    "I'm sorry, the card says 'Moops.'"   There really is no "left" in America.  The US political spectrum runs from right-wing through extremely right-wing to *insanely* right-wing.   What will the Republicans do when they run out of "Culture War" rage wedge issues?   No. That's why we all know Rand's stunts are nothing but prelude to setting up a string of MONEYBOMBS! over the next 1.5 years.  His grifter Dad Ron Paul taught him well.   AMA Request: Josh Duggar   How would the Cliven Bundy Militia have reacted if Cliven Bundy had instead received the [Eric Garner treatment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-xHqf1BVE4) ?   I'm pleased I was able to enhance your state of self-realization this day. Go forth, my son.   Nope. The Kermit Gosnell case is a perfect example of Libertarian ethics at work.   Bundy has also said on many, many occasions that he "doesn't recognize the Federal Government as even existing."  He's not a folk hero, and this isn't some "principled stand."    Ask the Duggars.   I hope they're just nodding along while their husbands spout Fox/AM bullshit, but listen to their own hearts and consciences when alone in the ballot box.   Is this the Kochs' *ALEC* unit at work again?   He wrote a *very* strongly-worded letter, he'll have you know.   An update on Sean Hannity's former best buddy.      *Amazing* article here on the Bundy Ranch/Las Vegas "Don't Tread On Me!" killers.  [The Chilling Anti-Government, Cliven Bundy-Loving Facebook Posts of the Alleged Las Vegas Shooters: Jerad and Amanda Miller's Facebook and YouTube likes included the NRA, Rand Paul, FreedomWorks, and other right-wing championsand videos justifying the killing of police officers.](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/jerad-amanda-miller-las-vegas-shooting-cliven-bundy-anti-government)    I have never and will never apologize for voting for Nader.

 Wait for it.I'll send as soon as I can.   Ok,thanks for advice.  	2
 I heard a great idea on /r/Firefly that it was a GoT style TV series about 14 different people recieving the message from the end of Serenity and how the rest of the galaxy reacts.   Game is so hard on mobile.   Nova: Annihilation   Too soon   I couldn't find most of the New X-Men (Surge, Prodigy, Elixr etc). Are they are there?   No, but the power he displayed in the movie was still greater than he power SW displayed.   If we include Namora, can we include Hercules?   Comic Scarlet Witch? Sure. But she's not really displayed that much power in the movies yet.   I feel like it needs trimming, but I'm welcome to addition suggestions.

If so, what's the point of the variant?   First Class is so much fun.   I absolutely agree, but for every writer that does a good job of being edgy (see: Garth Ennis or classic Frank Miller), you get five who aren't (see: modern Mark Millar or Grant Morrison's Happy). It annoys me that good writers try to hard and make every other word a cuss or have a prostitute get killed every other issue.   I think it's more about having the whole team involved for a sense of visual completion.   So like Milestone, but for women? That sounds awesome. Do you think it'd be likely they'd write Superhero comics?   So did his Daredevil. I'd argue his Avengers was also pretty good when not wrapped up in events.   I'm not entirely sure, but I think I would have saved Stane as the villain for another film. He would have acted as Tony's mentor, but it was hinted that he was doing some dodgy dealings meanwhile. As they were building a universe, having recurring characters like Stane would have been important. I probably would have gone for Hammer or the Mandarin as other villains and would have had a greater focus on Tony's drinking.  Sorry if that's a bad answer.   The Hulk in Tokyo would be pretty cool.   More importantly, any post slightly critical of these movies is downvoted. This shows quite a closed minded attitude.    * Revolving door of death * Too many pointless events * Too many variants * Superhero comics are the only mainstream image of comics * Reluctancy to start afresh * No sense of scale as major events happen in every cape book all the time and they kind of undermine events * Lack of women in the industry * Oversexualised characters * Inconsistent timelines * Crappy creative teams on the best characters * Most great Superhero stories are only great in the context of that character * There's too many creator-owned books that are 2edgy4me. Why can't you tell a story with sex and violence, without playing edgy comics bingo? * Status quos never last * Being a new reader is horrifying    "I need to talk to Caesar!"   But, that's not very interesting or entertaining, is it?   Apparently Idris Elba can never be Bond because of the leaks.    Would you care to go over aboriginal history?   I feel The Raid 2 was the movie Evans wanted to make initially, but couldn't due to budget restraints. 2 opens up the world, creating a horrendous Gangster's Paradise whilst still topping the action of the first one. That kitchen fight.   Iron Man - how does Jeff Bridges' Stane go from a morally complex businessman to a cartoon villain in the last twenty minutes? Up until that point, Bridges was one of my favourite parts of that film.   Thor 2's visuals were splendid and made the movie for me.   Full gay?   I used to complain that the opening of Guardians of the Galaxy felt forced and undeserved, but now it just upsets me.   Source?   Not really. I don't mind Melissa McCarthy (although our senses of humour differ greatly), but I think Paul Feig is a good director by any means. He's an average television director who made traction because he did some mediocre work on some great shows.  I was never a fan of Paul Feig, but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FOzD4Sfgag) really enlightened me to why.      Still waiting to watch The Assassination of Jesse James and The Wicker Man. Still waiting...   Fast and Furious 5-7 are pretty good movies, the first four... Not so much.   The Outlaw Josey Wales   Elf   I love Cullen Bunn's Deadpool miniseries. They're so much fun.   Flashpoint was pretty good, I thought. I only read the main event though.   I think it'll be fine as long as he's not just throwing out one-liners.   It stopped being a procedural last year though.   Season 3 was just a mess. It was four episodes' worth of plot, stretched out over thirteen.   I'd rather see a Gotham Central TV series.      Tokyo Drift ain't got nothing on Fast Five.   They wouldn't kill Matt's one Asian friend, would they?   I'm trying to imagine Rupert Grint as Penance now.   All of your choices, The Runaways, Young Avengers, White Tiger and Nova.   James Wan was 27 when he made Saw.    Eminem, but once he's famous. His troubles metamorphosed into a unique beast once he hit platinum. Drugs, rap, assult and fatherhood are pretty interesting subjects for a movie. Alas, I guess having two biopics is a bit unfair.   I've never met someone else who doesn't like LotR. I knew there were at least dozens of us! Dozens of us!   It was called Lord of the Rings - they're family movies. Don't try and turn kid's movies into an insult. There are so many great ones.   I actually think it's a reference to that famous Superman line, "faster than a speeding bullet."   So, favourably and lots of people will rewatch them time and time again? Does that mean this sub's equivalent to T2 in 30 years is The Winter Soldier?   Why not Adamantium nails?   Is this Macbeth as an action movie? I'd think that'd be pretty cool.   Bendis really knows what the kids are into.   As much as I love it, I kind of doubt it. It's so dependant on poking fun of contemporary films and filmmakers it'll date pretty poorly IMO.   Django has a bunch of unofficial sequels starring other actors.     Snikt, bub.   They can take Cornwall as well.   He's one of my favourite film composers and having him come back would greatly excite me.   This is very funny and all, but they've kind of misunderstood Ultron's motives, then again Whedon didn't really make it very clear in the film himself.   And an episode of The Office. I belive it was the episode before Joss Whedon's.   Nobody said there weren't. Maybe you should review the title again.   I can't remotely blame them, but wouldn't you love to see more?   I meant this year. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't that many movies. These movies have been over twenty years, the average amount of non-cape comic book movies a year is still under two on average. That really isn't great, especially compared to the number of book adaptions.   Are there? Obviously I can think of the classics like A History of Violence and V for Vendetta, but I can only think of one comic movie released so far this year that wasn't a cape movie (Kingsman). Care to give me some more examples?   It's about being able to see him making a difference. It has more weight and substance when you can immediately see the consequences. A caveman can understand the danger when Supes catches Louis in Siperman: The Movie, but the convulted saving the world victories have less weight and are harder to celebrate, especially if you're already not that into a movie.   Fair enough, although I really meant in the final act.   Hawkeye could get divorced. That could be an interesting direction for the character. Having to move out with only a dog and Kate to keep him company.   Quite a few years away, but I'm very much looking forward to Gareth Evans capping off his Raid trilogy.   He still didn't break Gordon though, so overall it's a loss.   Nope. He didn't break Gordon, although he did trick Batman into killing him.   Superman's character was defined by what others told him, so by the end of the film I had no idea what kind of person he was. I have no problem with Supes destroying clearly vacated buildings, but I do mind him never going out of his way to save individuals. A scene involving him saving people would have helped me see him more of a hero. This one is purely personal preference, but the colour scheme didn't work for me and I can't imagine it in a Superman movie. Even though it quoted All-Star Superman, it didn't really get what made Superman special (hint: his complete altruism). The action didn't really work for me, I felt like there was too much happening on the screen, even when simple things like flight were happening. My biggest complaint is the mixture of conflicting symbols - was Supes Jesus, Moses, the embodiment of the American dream, a foreigner in our land?   Her character was older.   This is the only Zak Snyder movie I've enjoyed, but I still don't think it's that good. Would you mind if I explained why I didn't like it *that* much?   I think Lord of the Rings is well made garbage.   I say that's only really true for this century.   This isn't an unpopular opinion, especially on /r/movies.   Secret Invasion: Black Panther is really excellent. Jason Aaron writes badasses really well.   Josh Brolin as Nick Fury is brilliant.   How has no-one mentioned Drax specifically?   Casablanca   The annoying thing is, Birdman isn't even pretentious. It mocks pretentious movies as much as it does blockbusters.   So the answers to "What's a movie similar to Pulp Fiction/The Wolf of Wall Street/Fast and Furious 7?" Are all the same?  Yup. Sounds like /r/Movies.   What is the point of Wolverine's Adamantiun skeleton?   I've been watching this post for the past 5 hours and all I can say is /r/ movies sure is a fickle bunch. Right now it's at +8, but an hour ago it was at -4 and an hour before that it kept circling around -1 to 1.   Do they present them without bias? Like, did they the bad shit they did as well? I really want to know if they included the beating of Dee Barnes in there.   This is great. Surprised by the downvotes though, it's as if people just saw Marvel and downvoted and didn't read your excellent analysis of Ultron'a motives and aims.   Were it the late 80s we would have turned on Spielberg, but instead hindsight has caused Jurrasic Park to be the top of this thread.  *I love Spielberg.   If not, do you think it has the potential to be somewhere down the line?      Where in the thread say it defines cinema? I was under the impression we were just listing scenes we really, really enjoyed. Frankly, that is an excellent choice and is one of the best scenes in modern action movies (which makes up a good chunk of modern cinema).   Has the anti-Marvel circlejerk gotten so bad, we're downvoting a guy for expressing the fact he liked a scene in the Avengers? Really?   You can't even call it House of M as it's named for Magneto.   Watching him is the most akward, uncomfortable and weirdest thing. I love it.   The Dark Knight.   Toy Story 3.   Eric is just a dick. There's nothing heroic about him, he's just a dick.  I'd actually be quite interested to see an Aronofsky-esque take on Hank Pym; watching his obsession with science destroy the relationships around him would be awfully thrilling.   What are you on about? The serial-adultering, wife-beating, murder-bot creating, mad scientist isn't a good person?  No? How about a compelling character then? I read an interesting post from a while back saying that what makes Hank interesting is how much he means well, yet still constantly does bad things and this is because he is inherently a bad person, but he doesn't want to be.   Movie is Kung Fury BTW   Have fun. Despite a few bum movies here and there, you're set on a real adventure.    My favourite podcast for comic book movies is The Weekly Planet.   Sorry, I'm a bit confused; what led you to conclude it wasn't a comedy?   Is All-New Captian America any good?   I loving Astonishing X-Men's Cyclops outfit.   Hard to explain; just read Alias.   It was filmed here.   If we're counting 2001, can I count Star Wars?   I'm glad they're trying to get more girls interested in science and maths, but I wish they had said "inspire other people" instead of "inspire other girls" as I don't think there are nearly enough female role models that boys look up to and I think there should be more.    I've always accepted it as a very subtle commentary on politics and comic books that Bendis decided the most powerful people in the 616 are all moderately wealthy, white men. Pointing that out diminishes it's impact.    Stuff like this makes Mark Waid one of my favourite writers     I have a lot of things to complain about. Price, crossovers, restricting creators to a house art style, the New 52 keeping parts of the old continuity without being clear what. I just can't be bothered to phrase it politely.    Several times.   See also: Marvel Studios and Christopher Nolan   There's only a  5 year difference for Arrow, in Dexter it was about 18.   Another TV example, but putting 30-something Michael C Hall in a bowl cut wig does not make him look 16.  	116
 Whatever you do, don't listen to reggae....   Thanks for that edit. A crucial detail many might have missed /s   http://i.imgur.com/GfJNU68.gif   I'll include the further definition then...    "an outcome cruelly, humorously, or strangely at odds with assumptions or expectations."  A black fly in white wine? A post-mortem death pardon? That's pretty clear cut to me.   What're you talking about? Irony is "a state of affairs or an event that seems deliberately contrary to what was or might be expected." Every last bit of that song is ironic.

Not that I planned on selling them anyways. I suppose I should give my grandfather's book a go. I've read Spymistress and Intrepid, and I find his prose a bit jaunty. That, combined with his general habit of being an asshole when he was alive, has discouraged me somewhat.    I did notice that rule in the sidebar, but I hoped my question at the end on which book to read first would accomplish that. Is the current edit sufficient?    Not sure if this is allowed, but I don't really know where else to share it. Recently, while digging through the archives of my family's publishing company, I found a pile of old books by Robert Louis Stevenson, my ~great great great great grandfather.  No idea what they are worth, nor if anyone will find this interesting, but thought I would share.  [Enjoy.](http://imgur.com/a/9HjXF)  EDIT: I wish this post was more informative, but unfortunately I'm not really in touch with that side of my family. If anyone knows anything about these books, or about RLS (or my grandfather) in particular, I'd love to hear more.   *suggestive beeping*   The show and the foundation are separate entities.

I mean, I thoroughly agree with the educational value Sesame Street brings to the table, but all these studies ARE commissioned by the Sesame Foundation.  That aside, here's a fun fact/ shameless plug for /r/bermuda: The CEO of the Sesame Foundation, Mel Ming, is fucking awesome and grew up in a really hard part of my country. I've interviewed him a few times and he's a top notch man.    Reminds me of how the lizards my cat eats must feel.   "Illegal." Wait what?

Because how he was poisoned is debatable. What he was poisoned with is not.   As someone who didn't know anything about Turing beforehand, I thought the film was great. Reading up on it afterwards though, it was abundantly clear the portrayal of him was well off the mark. That said, I didn't buy Keira Knightly being a maths whiz for one second.

After I left my job at my local national paper, I started a satire blog that people immediately began sharing thinking it was real. [This one,](http://thebermudalampoon.com/2015/02/27/michael-fahy-not-about-to-start-giving-a-shit/#more-192) about an appointed official (rather than elected) caused a 1000+ comment chain.   Good satire is taken seriously by LOTS of people. The former FIFA vice president, for example. Or even the OG satirist, Jonathan Swift. A Modest Proposal caused an uproar.   That's the most satisfying part of writing satire, when people think it's real. It's really the highest compliment.   That's kinda the nature of sketch comedy, [as expressed perfectly by the Mitchell and Webb Look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE_Glg85-60)   Journalist here.

Dolphins though? Fuck that. I'm convinced they're smarter than us, they just live a simpler life.   I once volunteered at a dolphin experience place for a summer and had to go down with SCUBA gear to fix the fencing separating their enclosures. The 11 foot alpha named Khyber got hyper aggro and started jaw snapping at me. The shockwave shook my ribcage so much it felt like someone let off a grenade underwater.  They are terrifying animals. Nobody ever takes my phobia seriously, but I challenge anyone to get into a tank with a pissed off dolphin and tell me they didn't fear for their life.

I love the idea of this sub because it's sort of a /r/mildlyinteresting version of it. You could put TIL in front of a LOT of factual posts on Reddit and it would work.   Journalist here.   WE. DON'T. WRITE. THE. HEADLINES.  Feel the need to make that extra clear because every time there's a sensational headline, it's the author that gets blamed for it. 99% of the time we HATE the headlines our stories are given.  Call out the sub-editors, not the authors.   Teddy Roosevelt - the original hard-ass romantic. The duality between his inner suffering from his personal losses, and the person he projected to the world, are infinitely fascinating to me.   He sorta had this need to assure and remind everyone of his heroism, but at the same time was aware of his own limitations and listened to what his heart told him. Rare you find those qualities in the same man.   Anderson Cooper is a stellar journalist. He fucked off to Africa in his teens IIRC (bankrolled by his family, but still...). He started in journalism by answering telephones, before he made a name for himself by forging his own press pass and getting into Burma to interview the students fighting the government. After that he began stringing from war zones all over the world.  He may not be a Marie Colvin, or a Philip Gibbs, but he's legit. I dont find any reason not to like the guy.

Last I heard she was an Eagle Scout.   STORY TIME!  Freshman year in high school, my buddy got a hand job from a girl named Davina.   She basically clapped her hands around it and rubbed up and down like she was trying to start a fire with a stick and some tinder.  Thus 'Dolphina' was born.   Already spent on rum and hookers. Sorry.   That's not a bad idea, but it'd be damn near impossible to sell. I might give Elon a call though, just for good measure.  The Guardian has a long and storied history of breaking earth-shattering stories dating all the way back to when the Bolsheviks leaked documents exposing the Entente's imperial interests of WWI. That kind of history attracts supporters, so it's no wonder benefactors favour them.   The point is that reliance on advertising for revenue creates that conflict of interest. Hence the BBC. NPR would've been the same, and in fact started out the same IIRC.       I love that people still expect separation of church and state in the media. Of course they banned their reporters from doing that. Of course, it's also wrong, but the public doesn't want to pay for news. Don't want to pay, don't expect the tenets that journalism once espoused to remain.  Signed,  Severely disgruntled journalist    Was really hoping this would be an America's Cup reference.  For those that don't know, the Brits invited the Americans to sail against them, with the Queen looking on.  America proceeded to detroy the British by a massive margin. Thus the "America's Cup" was born.  It would take almost 180 years before anyone else beat the Americans, when Australia did it in 1981 (I think.)  So... yeah, the Brits aren't too hot on sailing against the Americans.  	105
       Poor guy. I hope he can kick it again. His playing career may be just about over, though.    They won't be missed. In fact, I don't miss mining.    I've used Havelock in the past, back in the Neo   Bee days. They seem honest and pretty good about communicating. That said, I wouldn't risk a huge amount there or on any of their offerings--only what you can afford to lose.    You tell 'em, Jeff!   That's going to be a truly awful team this year, no matter what the players call themselves.       He played in the NL for Arizona, don't forget. He hit .226 the year before he went to Detroit.    That's a great shot.   How much would you have to give in order for Sovereign Prince Hans to find it worth redeeming?      For some of us, it does. But when 99.99% of everything we need is denominated in fiat, we still care whether Bitcoin is worth $1 or $1000.    Somebody must have made a political donation.    Traders have to measure its weight in something, otherwise it has no value. They could use gold or some other fiat. Maybe someday, these all will be priced in crypto.    Get a new owner.    Ha ha. You might be right, but HRC already has a national constituency and she's trouncing these guys in the early polls. She WILL suck up the money if she runs, so it will be interesting to see if she's as moderate as her husband was or if she runs to the left. Primary voters are definitely more extreme in both parties, but I'd argue that this situation is more severe in the GOP.    He's a lefty. If he can throw strikes and keep people guessing on the location, he doesn't need much velocity.    The right GOP candidate in the general election is not the same GOP candidate who can win GOP primaries. One must be moderate, the other extreme (and borderline insane).   If Jeb Bush can suck up enough of the money early on, he could just say 'screw it' and run towards the middle right away. See what happens. I don't see them beating HRC with that far-right platform.    Hold. The client and wallets should be done in the next few weeks.      He's a lefty, so if he can throw strikes, he'll probably have a job.   You need to be 'interesting' to fit in with that front office in Colorado.

So Bitcoin's volatility problems can be solved by hedging with BitUSD. Wallet on the way. Very cool!   It does look pretty nasty. Being publicly traded, it is subject to some SEC regulation, and so they won't necessarily get away with the Wild West antics we've seen in the cryptosphere. But that also means they need to be more careful. There are ways to pump that are legal, but plenty of penny stocks have had government problems for playing fast and loose.    Yes, BitUSD can handle volumes. It's designed just for this. The 1.0 client is coming out very soon, so you'll probably be hearing a  lot more soon about how it can help someone with Bitcoin to avoid any volatility issues.    The volatility issue is overblown. With BitPay or Coinbase, etc., one can cash out every day into fiat. Better yet, as you've indicated, there are other cryptos and services that allow someone to hedge the price without going back into actual fiat.      Good post and I agree with you, except that it's rather disappointing. If I read something called "Why you should support the Olympics baseball bid", then I want a link to a petition or I want you to tell me HOW I can help this cause.

       My question is why do all of these people who make these remarks are GOP?                                    I am worried that one day that I am going to have move away from Southern California because of the massive drought that we have.  It seems that there needs to be mass migration to the North as the West drys up, the North will become habitable.  Unless we want to pay $10.00 for gasoline and ride the OCTA/Metro everywhere, I just feel real cynical that things are going to change because there is not the will to change things even this is a clearly obvious threat but nobody wants to do the self-sacrificing to change things.

Do these guys have any idea about fiscal sanity.  Not even Greece cuts taxes when they told to engage in austerity.    The GOP practices one part of austerity but it does not engage in the second part of austerity which is tax hikes so the state has a balanced budget.

It clears my mind and helps me deal with stress.     It is totally wrong because it does not respect the sexuality of the individual.  However, my main concerns that the person might have addictive tendencies that could result in codependency, lack of self-esteem, or other issues.    Name calling somebody does not solve the person's problem.  It is talking and listening to the person's problem that would solve the problem.     Brush my teeth for two minutes.   As long as my daughter is not engaged in porn producers that are committed to respecting the sexuality of daughter and do not put her in situations where she could be sexually assaulted, I would have no problems with it.   By pointing out the people that God does not exist.   The day that I got my second arrest.   Why would somebody to pay to stay in jail in LA?  In OC, it makes sense because they make do some time in the county jail, but in LA, it just not make sense.     I stayed in one. It was $100 a day in the OC jail for 13 days. One of the guys that I locked up was serving a four year sentence for DUI manslaughter. (4 years @ 50% = 2 years time served).  That is $73000 to stay in the jail.  I have no idea where he got the money to pay for it.   Personally, I do not care when I post. But I considered to be a serial poster because I post mainly local news stories and articles that I come upon interesting when I do my web surf.  In my opinion, there is no "correct" time to post.

Really fun movie.     It is probably all of the companies laying off season staff. Not a big deal.   Does these people even care about the public good.  People are going to start to hit the streets and have massive demonstrations weekly to deal with these guys.    Movement politics is only way to deal with things. Hit the streets week and week out until the voting public gets the message to throw out these guys.   1. Iran's nuclear threat is greatly overstated by the Republicans. 2. Iran has a terrible, terrible record of human rights  The real issue with Iran is its human rights record (which we in the US really cannot lecture Iran until we take of own issues).  Further sanctions should be based on human rights issues and not tied to greatly exaggerated nuclear threat.    The GOP does not answer the solutions to those problems because they have zero desire to raise taxes to cut the national debt.   There is also the path that is along the Santa Ana River which I also run frequently.   If you do not mind driving to Santa Ana, Santa Ana College also has a track.

 It is usually the funny ones that have internal struggles that no one knows of. Can't believe it...         Either method will yield the same result.   I feel like people who aren't teachers have improper perspective on the job itself. Where as people who are teachers have a "holier than thou" attitude. (Soley based on these posts).  I myself am a high school teacher. Graduated 3rd (of 115) from my high school and was on the dean's list throughout 4 years while pursuing a BSc (double major in Biology and Psychology,  minor in Earth Science). I'd like to think I am a relatively intellegent person, who went on to become a teacher.   That being said, I agree that teaching isnt the toughest job in the world. My wife is an ICU Nurse...and I'd never be able to deal with the shit she does (ie. Shift work and people who could die at the drop of a hat). However,  as she has informed me, she'd never want to do what I do. Stand onfront of (on average) 120 15-17 year old kids and try to teach them things, prepare lessons that are engaging as well ad informative,  handle classroom management (such as that ine kid who just jumped out a window...or that other kid that just full on bitch smacked another kid). My point is ever job has its difficulties and its easy portions, however until you have 1st hand experience (such that you have got the training, degrees, and job) don't knock it based on preconceived notions and shit experiences you've had with someone who was clearly not good at their job.  For me to get my current postion, I underwent an interview that 14 other applicants also took...but I managed to come out on top. This was after applying for a total of 12 other positions that individuals more experienced than myself recieved. Yes it's true that places are crying for teachers...but the government isn't putting money into education departments to allow for them to come in.   Tl:dr  I'm was top of my class both in high school and university and became a teacher. My wife's an ICU nurse, I'd never fucking want that job and visa versa. All jobs have pros and cons, don't knock it unless you've actually done the job yourself. I've never smoked marijuana, but I dont condemn people who do.   Best option ever. I was in the same boat.

 Not personally but a couple friends have and said it is awesome and totally worth it.   Clean, dry, was my body and hair I threw on my brand new NASA underwear for all the bitches I might take home I got the Johnson baby powder and Cool Water cologne Now I'm fresh, dressed, like a million bucks Threw on my aviators, with my all blue chucks...   Coffee Cat Friends   He's clearly trolling and knows his audience (American dudes). But I think he's confident that they're going to go head to head with Germany this generation.   LOL the original source would be the Facebook post everyone is citing. Just because it's on Motor Trend doesn't make it the 'Original' source.      A few years ago I flew from Nashville to LA and Val Kilmer was in the seat in front of me. In the back in coach. On a commercial flight. All he carried on was a backpack and a painting he bought or someone gave him that day. I think he was in town doing some Indie film with Nicole Kidman.  Anyway, here was this once big movie star, Batman, Jim Morrison, Doc Holladay, Ice Man from Top Gun, The Saint, Real Genius, Heat, Top Secret, etc. overweight and on a flight packed with normal people all staring at him sort of wondering why he's there. Kinda felt bad for him, but for the better part of a 3+ hour flight he was just the chillest guy ever like 'The Dude'.   He would talk to anyone who wanted to chat him up, was patient and never condescending answering the same questions over and over, taking pictures with people. He did tell us that Doc in Tombstone is THE role people quote or bring up to him every day which didn't surprise anyone. He also said there are some big Real Genius and Top Secret fans (both classics). I'm really into cars and he told me he had a GTO and we talked about that for a bit.  I heard he was having some health problems last year and I know his career hasn't been the best of late. But this picture makes me smile.  Val Kilmer abides.   Spotify could easily go lossless at some point just like Netflix and YouTube are now adding/accepting 4k content. I don't think the general public is going to care either way. Is it simpler than pirating? does it work well? Do they have the music I want to hear? Lossless quality is a consideration but further down the list.   As HOV says: 'Numbers don't lie check the scoreboard'   There will be a tipping point for electric cars to be the predominant automobile. Maybe 15 years out? The charging infrastructure will get better, the range will get better, they will get cheaper, etc. The infrastructure I don't see being a huge problem because except for long trips, you just plug it in at home every day. You are your own gas station.  I hear of Chevy Volt owners rarely buying any gas.  I think self driving cars are going to take a lot of work, testing, and PR/convincing before the general public is confident in it. It's a neat option but people do like driving. And car enthusiasts really like driving. Will racetracks eventually be the only place to do it? That is maybe 40-50 years away?  	10
 That book... just... I don't even know what to say about that one scene in the cave. You know the one. Only King could write that and not have Chris Hansen kick in his door with the Dateline crew. It's weird how he managed to turn that into a POSITIVE thing - I think that is what makes it one of the most horrifying books of all time. It can make the reader see something positive about something so fucked up no matter how uncomfortable you feel.

I just see the henain period and on as producing some of histories most incredible swords. The change in sword geometry calls for a change in cutting technique.

 Was on a camping trip with some friends, in which we all smoked weed and we're drinking. A girl that I had invited brought a friend along that none of us really knew. As I stood there giggling at nothing and everything due to the bud, she looked me dead in the face and said "you're a drug addict and I hate you." it took me completely by surprise as I hadn't done anything to this girl and had just been standing there happy as fuck. For some reason this was the most offended I have ever been to this day.    Next time I'm definitely avoiding the mirror, that shit was too weird   Thanks for the advice, I'll probably just end up waiting then. No point in fucking my body up for a high.    I read about that actually, but I really rushed this for my first time. Honestly the nausea wasn't as bad as I expected and during the trip I didn't get the soreness that I've read about in other reports. I'll definitely try it next time though.    I also had a few questions about tolerance. I would like to try this again in a stress free environment, because I feel like it could really be a great drug. How long do I have to wait in between doses? If I were to take 600 seeds in a few days, would I get similar results?    Hey there r/drugs, I just tried lsa for the first time and figured I'd share my experience. Took 300 seeds of heavenly blue morning glory, chewed to a paste in my mouth, and then swallowed after letting it sit in there for 20 minutes.   After about an hour I noticed the effects starting, which at first was just insane euphoria. Put me in a great mood and made me want to keep trying different things around my house.   After about 2 hours I started getting slight visuals, which at first was just that my floor was kinda swirling around and would raise and lower in waves.   After about 4 hours, things started to go bad. I think this is when I really started peaking. I went into my bathroom and stared at myself in the mirror, amazed that everything I was looking at was exactly as it was around me. Then my face started morphing and it was like looking at a totally different person. The area around my eyes were black and really trippy looking. This kinda freaked me out, so I decided to just listen to some music. It was amazing. Sounded so real and so right, and I was also getting slight CEVs, which were just fractal patterns. It was then that I noticed the voice in my mind. I could hear my thoughts as if someone else were talking to me, and could only focus on one thought. Kept getting stuck in weird thought loops. Decided it was too freaky and went to sleep. Not an easy task when you have a loud ass voice in your head.   Next morning rolls around as soon as I opened my eyes I could feel the liquid firey shit brewing in my stomach. It was probably the most disgusting thing I've ever felt, and I'll spare the details of its exit from my body. Other than that I felt totally normal, other than a really sore leg and back. Was in a weird mood for a few hours where I felt nothing, good or bad, about anything. This subsided by noon and since then I've felt great. Overall I'd say it went pretty bad, but that probably had a lot to do with my being stressed about having to wake up early and pack for the weekend. I plan on trying it again when I have nothing stressful on my mind, because it really was fun at first. Thanks for reading!   Tl;Dr- peaked after 4 hours, felt like a small schizophrenic, and slept it off. Next day I pooped liquid fire for hours      I actually did 700 last night (probably my tenth time on it) and it was bullshit. Or so I thought. Got the typical visuals, like wavy walls and the weird see through blobs. Didn't realize I was actively hallucinating until I would have a convo with a friend, turn around and then they'd just be gone. Worst part was when I decided to take a shower, started it up, and realized I didn't have a towel. So I go to my room to get it and totally forgot about the shower. 2 hours later I had to piss and was getting angry because my roommate was taking so damn long in there. Took me a good amount of time to realize was I did.    I like to think so for myself. Was in a bad place after making horrible life choices, which when coupled with preexisting depression was pretty awful. Tripped one night with some friends and while they were having fun, I sat against the wall having insanely vivid flashbacks. I mean things I didn't even know I remember were coming back to me. It was then that I realized that my life truly wasn't as horrible and hopeless as I always thought it was, and that the issues I was dealing with at the time weren't going to ruin my life, but rather lead me down a new path filled with endless opportunity. Since then I haven't gone through bouts of deep depression as I always had, and I've had an overall positive outlook on my life and future. Since then, I can honestly say that I've been happy for the first time in my life.   Edit: I should also note that I'm not a daily, or even weekly user. Smoke weed every so often, and trip like once a month.   Yeah that's what I use too! And I usually just save individual albums as playlists and choose one of them once the trip gets going    For me personally, music is what makes the trip. It's like the songs are unrecognizable, as they seem to slow down, and it also seems like extra layers are added that weren't there before. That's really the best way I can describe it, it's like the drug adds beautiful riffs that aren't there sober. As for artists, my go to trip albums always come from Floyd or the Grateful Dead. The solos become something amazing and special. Occasionally I'll listen to trap, but the best hallucinations I've gotten are with my two go to bands.   Hey there r/drugs, just trying to spark a discussion on my favorite part of tripping on dxm. I'd love to hear your thoughts on it, and I'd like to share mine as well! So some questions to get things going..  1) what type of audio halucantions do you get when you mix music with dxm?  2) what are your favorite genres, artists, etc. while tripping  3) how would you describe the difference it creates in the music to someone who has never tried it?   I'm glad Google is a thing, otherwise I probably would have always accepted that as a fact   At first I ft nothing. Then next thing I know I'm laughing at stupid shit, and I knew I was already fucked. It was one bowl. One. Now, I'm waiting cosmos with Niel De whatever tison. Mind is blown right now, and I think I'm still coming up.... I missed bud so much   I recently made a post about how a dxm trip opened my eyes and cured my depression. It was the trip itself however and not the afterglow that lifted the depression though, so that's pretty much just luck. If you're curious however, I was on about 1200-1500, not really sure of the exact dose.    Just overall not caring about anything. I can't think of the word I want to use right now, but pretty much nothing really mattered, everything and everyone were just bleak and there. And pretty much anytime I messed up I'd get thoughts of suicide that wouldn't go away. Before the trip though all of that was really intense for some reason.    Definitely a welcome change. It's like my mind is finally clear from some kind of fog. I was really surprised that it happened from a dissociative though, as I always thought it had the opposite effect.    Hey there r/drugs! I very recently had the trip of my life with dxm and thought it was definitely worth sharing. I'm pretty experienced with dxm, so large doses are pretty much the only way I can get my kicks (around 1200 this time). Typically I just get the robowalk, headspace, and music sounds freaking amazing. That combined with those crazy awake-dream things makeup a usual trip for me.   This time however, it was totally different. I was in a pretty bad mental state before the trip due to my depression, and this led me to get seriously close to killing myself. Luckily my friends there stopped me. Anyways, I sat there in my depression crying like a little girl when I started getting these vivid memories. Things I could never remember before started flooding into my mind and before I knew it I was able to remember everything that's ever happened to me. Like things from when I was three and beyond became insanely clear, and I just sat there and watched my whole life unfold. After this I realized that my life is truly not that bad, and that the depression I've always felt has been for nothing. I gained an appreciation for life that I've never felt before.   This was about 2 weeks ago and I can still just go back to all of those memories, and since then my depression has been nonexistent. For the first time I had a truly life altering trip.   The reason all of this is so amazing to me is that for the past few years I've had different repressed memories come back after smoking bud, and every one seemed so crippling. But now that I've seen the big picture I've come to realize that for everything bad that I've remembered, I also have something to be grateful for.   Tl;dr tripped balls on dxm and unlocked all of my memories, curing my depression.   This is the only comment on Reddit that literally made me throw my hands up and walk away laughing for a few minutes   I can totally relate to the last part. When I first started listening to Floyd I basically skipped to my favorite songs, but now I start on song #1 of the album and make sure it's not on shuffle. I think it also has a lot to do with the way they connect the endings and beginnings of their songs too.   Whilst afoot though the summer trees,   I can't help but notice the beautiful green,   and multitude of color through the leaves.    As shafts of light weave and leave their sheen,   I feel myself growing far more fonder,   That I have escaped society's ween.    But now my thoughts begins to wander,   And I travel to a place in my mind,   Where all I can do is think and ponder.    And now that my mind is no longer confined,   I realize that nature has cured me of being blind.   As someone on their way out of high school, I've never realized how true this is until now. A vast majority of our learning process (at least in my school) revolves around cramming every formula and theory into the students' heads without allowing us to learn to apply it and use it as a problem-solving tool. Honestly my senior year math (calculus) was the first math class I've had that truly requires the student to apply the skills they've learned, rather than just spitting information back out. There's a big difference between memorizing the rules behind differentiation, and actually possessing the ability to use and understand the processes behind them.   I broke my foot trying to walk on my hands once, so that was pretty ridiculous.   I'm not sure if it's like this in most places, but in my local head shop you are not allowed to say bong. Doing so will result in you getting kicked out of the store.. which I learned the hard way.  	24
    As someone who deals in the used textbook industry... It makes me SICK what college bookstores buy back books for!!! There is a site called bigwords.com you can enter the isbn # of the books you want to sell and it will list all the sites that are buying back and at what price. Most have free shipping included. You can also find the books you need the same way. Some of the sites actually have local bookstores that you can print off the quote and walk in and get that price in cash. Where the store may have paid $15, the site will pay $80. I really hope this helps some of you... I can't stand to see the shit these bookstores try to pull.   She has MS and doesn't get around very well anymore.... Fell and hit the coffee table. Shattered her cheek bone... My uncle is a really amazing man! I was married to one of the bad ones once too... She is definitely not! Thank you for your concern though, truly!   Haha! We are from Arkansas and I was in brownies with Chelsea...     Haha! I see the resemblance!! And she is from Arkansas!   That's horrible! My aunt fell into a coffee table as well. Shattered her cheek bone and has to have surgery now.   Haha! Yes, but everyone else's explanations are so much more fun!!!... She had a little run in with a coffee table. She shattered her cheek bone and pushed her eye back into her skull some, and now has to have reconstructive surgery. :(   I wouldn't put it past her!!!      You calling someone that just died and you don't know a shitbag, makes you a shitbag.   My ex suddenly sits up in bed, yells, "YABBA DABBA DOOO!!" Laughs, "Aah Ha haa!" Claps his hands, then lays back down... I cried, I laughed so hard.   A childhood friend of mine just posted this pic... Too cute not to share.      That sounds amazing!   You're really not missing anything....   Bitch   YES!!!!            Very happy!!!   Beautiful cat! Awesome camera!   You don't mean it, unless you make a meme about it...   Only one time... at band camp...   =D  	25
 There is no difference between the two when a government is sanctioning one over the other; our government's policy on religion at the federal and state level should not choose one form of religion over another.   I'm not here to debate the severity of punishments imposed by religions, just the hypocritical nature of christianity's impact on politics.   We're constantly forced to live by a set of morals that benefit Christians, even when the majority don't support those mores. Christians used the bible to justify slavery and later Jim Crow laws, and Supreme Court Justices quoted the bible to support their arguments. I want religion of any sort completely separated from our politics.   This week Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore ordered state judges not to issue same-sex marriage certificates based on Christian understanding of what constitutes a moral marriage. Isn't this proof of Christian laws being forced upon an entire population? The same can be said of LGBT rights and abortion.                                    Wolverines and then weasels, in that order. Wolverines spend so much time alone in such tough terrain that it must constantly curse about its shitty situation. Weasels just curse for the laughs.   Each photon that strikes the Earth today and powers everything on our planet began its journey from the center of the sun while dinosaurs were the dominate creatures. It takes a further eight minutes for the journey to our planet after the proton escapes the sun's gravity.                                                                                                      You will excuse me for not believing you about taking the citizenship test because you'd have mentioned it long before now. As for Bush, even his friends don't consider him that sharp.   I'm not thinking so much about Obama as I am G.W. Bush. His degree was purchased by his dad and his cronies, and like Reagan, was simply a puppet that fit Cheney's hand. But I'm also looking at legislators, some no longer serving, that believe in "legitimate rape" and ignore data that doesn't support their conservative or liberal beliefs.   This person provided uninformed information, what more proof do we need.   My suggestion isn't new. Theodore Roosevelt was the first to suggest testing as a requirement of government service during the late 1890s. Prior to testing, when a new republican/democratic legislation came to power, the winners handed out government positions as a reward system. The system meant the US government operated with the same level of dysfunction on display in New Orleans when G.W. Bush's buddy "Brownie" was in charge. Roosevelt adopted tests that are still given to federal workers today to assess their fitness for the position, thus doing away with the cronyism that limited government's functionality. My argument is that we need another method to assess the next level of government - our legislators.   You label my suggestion a "worse system" but without explaining why it's worse. Don't ask me why when you haven't provided a question.   Blaming voters for electing stupid legislators is simply unfair, considering that the misinformation about candidates that flood the air during an election cycle makes it almost impossible for a voter to make an informed decision. Contemporary voters are so overwhelmed by their working life that they depend on the MM to provide information about candidates but our news agencies are failing them.                        Obama out spent Romney, "with all his rich supporters."   I'm glad that you're happy with an idiot representing you in congress, but I expect more from my legislator. I don't understand the morality portion of your argument, but legality has nothing to do with intelligence. As for the mixture of the two, I'll point out that the US Supreme Court denied black Americans their most basic rights as human beings, yet it's supposed to be a bastion of American wisdom. Morality and the law simply don't mix in the US.   And to make this test/election even fairer, we'll allow those with the most money decide who the people get to elect, because everyone knows that rich people are always the smartest.   Most people don't know how intelligent/unintelligent their representative is until it's too late. We test immigrants to see if they're sufficiently American. Maybe our reps should take the same test.   Again, the test I'm proposing is along the lines of an elementary school civics test, which asks basic questions about the country we live in. Reviewing the responses to this question, I spot many "apologists" for politicians, along with the "I have a right to elect wealthy, stupid people" crowd. Someone even declared it a poll tax, while ignoring that the people elected to congress are some of the wealthiest in the land. With the amount of testing expected of our children, politicians argue that testing is the only way of knowing whether they are learning. Why should I expect less from a more important institution?   Wait...you still believe the US won the Vietnam War? I own this really cool bridge, but I'd be willing to sell it to you.   The origins of the abrahamic religions, thus getting rid of three of the peskiest religions out there.   Good point...but that's why I suggested an elementary civics test. I guess if the test were designed in state like Texas there might be a bias toward ignorance.   Please point me to where you get your information about this test.   A rich white man attempts to assassinate Bill O'Reilly by gun on air but misses. After O'Reilly wrestles the gun away he screams, "Fuck it...I'll do it myself", before committing suicide.   The decisions made by our nation's federal legislators impact a large segment of the US population but there is no way of knowing whether they are fit for office. A simple civics test on the level of a sixth grade student might be a starting point, but I also believe anyone running for office should be required to pass a drug test. Legislators appear to have no problem forcing drug tests onto welfare recipients, they should have no problem undergoing the same process.                                                                              If you wanted to be shocking you should have chosen a women. Everyone knows the catholic church is all about the man-on-man/boy action.   I wonder if Palin has a bush.   jesus christ and the virgin mary....yes, I can poke fun at your fairy tale.   I can't say that I've been stereotyped as gay, but I've had a *lot* of gay men hit on me. Of course, I'm not offended or put off by the LGBT community, and I'm comfortable in my sexuality.   Religion - it held back science for almost 2k years, it claims that its adherents are better than the non-believer, it claims a moral superiority, it ignores science, it impinges on the rights to marriage and abortion, and it is the most evil ideology to ever infect homo sapiens.                           All religions, by design, set people apart from one another by claiming their adherents are special and morally superior. This is utter bs. Religions pass moral judgments on unbelievers, while also attempting to force their morality on the societies they exist within. I'm expected to respect the folklore that the adherent lives by, but my rejection of this is seen as wrong. Without religion there is no war in the middle east, no rejection of LGBT rights, and no deaths because of rejecting religious beliefs.   Religion of any type is evil.                           Who said campaign contributions don't pay off in the long run?                              "I'm no scientist, but..."   I'm always afraid of telling this joke because it offends as many people as it entertains, but your welcome.   Sorry about that folks, but I did mean waitress. TY tthudium.   This joke was told to me by a female server I worked with in a downtown Denver restaurant/bar.      A guy is fucking his girlfriend in the missionary position but instead of showing any reaction, she just lays there, not moving. Starting to get angry, he flips her over on her stomach and starts really pounding her doggy style, but again she doesn't move. Now really upset, the guy shoves it in her backdoor while redoubling his efforts, but to no avail. After finishing, the guy rolls off his girlfriend who looks at him and said, "That was really presumptuous of you."      "Presumptuous?," he repeated.      "Yes," she said, "it was presumptuous of you to put it in my butt hole."      "Presumptuous," he repeated again. "That's a pretty big word for a twelve-year-old."   Additionally, most Americans don't know that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts was a founding member of the AFA, according to F. Lane.      Frederick S. Lane. The Court and the Cross: The Religious Rights Crusade to Reshape the Supreme Court. Boston: Beacon Press, 2008.    there is a god and you should have faith in him, not her, him.   god would help and protect me.   Politicians pretending to be religious or hating on the LGBT community only to get caught with a penis/vagina in their mouths. I secretly believe the politicians who overly inflate this issue are closeted haters driven by self-revulsion over their sexual yearnings.   A Harvard/Stanford/Princeton/etc. degree that instantly gives its holder a pedigree far beyond their deserving. There are so many good universities in the US and a degree's usefulness is really predicated on what the student got out of their courses.   When people say that we're killing the Earth, what they really mean is we're killing ourselves. The Earth will be just fine and continue turning like it's done for billions of years, humans just won't be there to see it.   In reading the article I noticed that when the candidates mentioned their opponents it was to comment on how financially viable they might be in a race. It's not about the issues, it's about who has the most money to spend in a campaign.   r/upskirts - it'd be a bunch of guys with secret cameras trying to pretend they don't have a camera, while following way too close to you.   New furniture, patient parents, and regular meals.   Religion sucks.   A parent can lose their children to the state for letting them walk alone to a park, but if they keep a loaded gun where it's accessible to a child, it's just unfortunate parenting.   Of course if it's his butthole getting fucked, he's not a fucking dude, he's a getting fucked dude   The real question is: How do guys who find anal sex with men wrong, but find it a bonus if their gf allows them its use? Are women's anuses softer than a mans; is it more pliant or pleasant smelling? Is it perhaps the lack of hair on a woman's anus, although this is a generalization as I've known a number of women with hairy butt holes?   The most gruesome thing I've ever seen is actually a compilation of two events by the same person. I grew up in a very rural southern area and one of our neighbors was an alcoholic. One summer day he was drunk and decided to commit suicide by placing a shotgun against his chest and pulling the trigger while sitting on the sofa in his living room. The blast left big chunks of the guy's chest and back on the wall behind him, but it didn't kill him. Following the trail of blood around the house, he got up from the couch, went into the kitchen and got another beer, then drank it at the kitchen table. Next, he went upstairs, sat on the edge of his bed for a while, before wandering back downstairs to the couch where he passed out. The crazy thing is that he survived.      Fast forward a couple of years and I'm now a sophomore in high school. Our neighbor has been caught so many times driving drunk that he's spent a year in jail, and lost his driving privileges along with his car. This doesn't slow my neighbor down one little bit as he has purchased a really nice riding lawnmower, removed its governor, and it now can reach speeds of up to 15mph. We lived on a gravel/dirt road with really heavy traffic and people loved to drive fast on it. One morning I'm on the school bus as we start the fifteen mile trip to our high school. I hear a shriek from a girl at the front of the bus, and the breaking bus threw me into the seat back. I looked out the window where the other kids were pointing and draped across a tree branch was our neighbor, twisted and dead. They found his riding lawnmower in the deep grass beyond the road. A man later came forward who said he knew he'd hit something but didn't know what. He assumed it was a deer that had survived the impact and run off because the lawnmower was hidden by the deep grass. He didn't see a body, of course, because it'd been thrown into and caught by tree branches. Seeing the results of this man's suicidal behavior twice left me with a propensity for nausea at meals that my brothers exploited viciously.     When I was ten-years-old someone abandoned their dog near our rural Tennessee home. My dad worked two jobs and refused to allow the family to have a dog because he considered them too expensive. I knew that my dad would think we encouraged the dog to stay, and punish us with whippings using his belt. In order to avoid this, I took the dog deep into the woods around our house. I placed it on the center of a very old bed sheet by telling it to sit and it obeyed with heart-breaking enthusiasm. I then took the .22 caliber rifle I'd brought along, and put a bullet between the dog's eyes. I'm still horrified and haunted by what I did that day, but I'm even angrier that poverty and my dad's adherence to a brutal religiosity placed a ten-year-old me into such a despicable situation.   Both parties are beholden to corporations, but my greatest concern is M. McConnell. He married into a wealthy chinese shipping family whose primary cargo is transporting coal. Kentucky is a coal producing state, and china is a coal burning nation; it's a match made in heaven. How much control do we concede to the chinese when the senate majority leader could well be working for their countries interests instead of the his constituents.   Imagine the level of cronyism in the federal system had this man been elected president.   That there are parts of my body that once developed during a super nova's explosion. We are all made out of star stuff.   Now you're making sense.   Yeah...and there is no more racism in America so get over it. (sarcasm)   The post title stopped where it did because of the character limits imposed by reddit.   When I was a child in Tennessee my parents allowed me to visit the Nashville public library by myself when I was only ten-years-old. When my mother was hospitalized for an extended time, I was the oldest child at home (12) while my dad worked two jobs. I hated being responsible for by little brothers and sisters, but I knew how to handle any dangerous situation and where to take my siblings if there was trouble. There's nothing wrong with letting responsible children have a little freedom.   Coward.   Can my mom come along?   Name calling is the last bastion of a losing argument. You concentrate only on "fundamentalists" as the bad lot while my argument is that religion in every form is inherently repressive, especially to those who aren't members. Several good examples of this are the current battles in the US being fought over access to abortion, and same-sex marriage. Remove religion from the argument and there is no opposition. Because of some stupid beliefs begun thousands of years earlier, large segments of the female US population live without access to life saving abortions, and same-sex couples can't enjoy the same legal protections as their heterosexual counterparts.      If you're going to respond further, let me ask just one question. What unique quality did Judaism have that was lacking in all the other religions prior to its inception? What set it apart from all other religions? As Neil deGrasse Tyson repeatedly points out, it's okay not to know the answer. No one has all the answers.   Another ad hominem argument, so you didn't really learn anything at all.      We are only going to continue talking past one another because we see the world in very different ways. I learned this from my oldest brother who is a preacher at a Church of Christ denomination in the american south. He saw the world through the lenses of "god" while my vision was obscured by my "godlessness." His conclusion came after I'd asked too many "unfair" questions concerning his beliefs. The most offensive question was "what is a day to god." He firmly believes in creationism as presented in the "bible" that is limited to six days with a seventh day for rest. His "god" just happened to follow the cycle of our planet's daily revolution. But to claim that this information is correct means understanding the mind of his "god", something that is supposed to be unknowable. Religious people are annoyed by these contradictions when they're pointed out.      The same problem applies to our conversation. You are willing to allow specious claims based on your religious views, and participate in a form of suspension of disbelief that might be called "faith". I don't share this predilection for applying "faith" based on the observance of a set of rules formed by individuals who lived thousands of years ago. In its purest form, religions are a method to control and funnel the hopes and fears of a downtrodden portion of the world's population. It banks on the the promise of an afterlife of paradise for a chosen few. I know this is the only life available to me and I refuse to waste it propping up the beliefs of an elitist few.    Where do you draw the line at what is acceptable? I find entertaining any religious beliefs as over the line and a strong indication of a person's intelligence, or lack thereof. I don't care what your interpretation of a religious text entails, they're all fantasy to me. Israel finds it acceptable to target women and children during wartime operations, while ISIS chooses its own targets according to religion and prefers beheadings over bombs. Both are dispicable courses of action, but met with approval by each religions' adherents. I see no distinction between the horrors visited upon those within each sects' religious boundaries. So defend blind adherence to your religion, but don't ask me to validate it.   I guess I could agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong.   IDK that your presenting an ad hominem argument (I'll let you look that up with the hope that you learn something) common among the "god squad". Respecting your beliefs mean I also must respect those who believe in stoning and decapitating people. It means respecting ridiculous beliefs put forward in any form of a "holy book" whether it's called a koran, bible, etc. Here's my advice: Don't blindly follow any ideology that resists being questioned or criticized, because it's the result of another person's thinking. Think for yourself, use reasoning and objectivity (two qualities religion lacks) to guide you, and reserve respect for that which deserves it. Live on your own terms.   I don't even know what the first portion of your rant is about, but refusing to recognize abrahamic religions as anything but the last vestige of our ancestors' feeble attempts to understand and cope with a cruel world, that's not racism; it is common sense. If every world sect followed the abrahamic traditions of blood and conquest as sanctioned by a higher power, Native Americans, Africans, South Americans, African Americans, and more would be rising world wide. Besides, Palestine has as long a history in the middle east as Israel.   NSC-68   A history of the world, particularly the US, written from the peoples' point of view instead of that embracing the popular western view of the "great individuals."   I know the single document that led to the expansion of the military industrial complex in the US. It's also the reason that the US government decided to abandon ideas for offering free college education and health care.   I did and there's still no excuse.   It is very different and the Armenians who were purged by the Turks would tell you so in no uncertain terms.   I trust nothing on Wikipedia about Israel because there is a whole battalion of Israeli writers who troll the site removing anything negative. The same applies to reddit, where they seek out and downvote any opinion that casts Israel in a negative light.   Israel's hypocrisy is breathtaking. As a people, they attack any criticism of the country, including calling the holocaust into question, as antisemitic. But they are willing to ignore and deny the holocaust of the Armenian people. I'm disgusted.   Who didn't see this coming? Buckley didn't give the CIA the report it wanted so he's got to go.   Abraham...it would do away with three very pesky religions. Sorry slaves.   I could pay off my student loans.   Let's eat Grandma.  Instead of: Let's eat, Grandma.   Israel isn't contributing to negotiations with the people it's occupied, kept in a apartheid situation, and whose children are murdered.   That's it, Israel, keep killing Palestinian children; I'm sure that's working out wonderfully for Israel.   I wish. Maybe it happened to the person who took my place.   Quantum entanglement and spooky action at a distance. Scientists are using its properties to teleport atoms, but I still don't understand how this can occur.   Prostitutes...or maybe just their pimps? I prefer to think it's the former.   I, too, will be spending the 25th doing laundry. I will also be reading and taking notes on *Empire of Cotton: A Global History* by Sven Beckert. Sounds boring but its boner material for a historian.   I was wondering this myself. My dad is a deeply religious man who believed people had forgotten the true meaning of the holiday. As a family, we stopped giving presents or putting up decorations when I was a ten-year-old. Looking back, I now believe our family was too poor to afford the gift-giving aspect of the holiday and he used religion as an excuse. Today, the holiday has no meaning for me, especially now that I avoid religion. Friends get mad at me for refusing their gifts, but I just don't want to participate in what's essentially become an orgy of consumerism. My attitude often worked against me because I waited tables a good portion of my life in an upscale restaurant located in a five-star hotel that remained open 365 days a year. Guess who always got stuck working alone on xmas.   Americans are terrified of the word "socialism", dating back to the 1890s. If this "revolution" is to succeed, the movement will need to rebrand itself as a nonthreatening entity to gain a foothold among Americans.    Then I'm rude, who cares if I piss off a bunch of disillusioned fools that believe in fairy tales.   Because AA weren't given agency by local or national government. Before the SC ended separate-but-equal policies and congress passed the 1965 Civil Rights Act, AA were given the worst jobs at the lowest pay and they simply couldn't afford to "invest" in refurbishing coffee shops they weren't allowed to visit during the 1960s. You could argue against the injustices forced on AA, and others may agree with you, but you'd both be wrong.   Race has long played a role in housing restrictions, both in Europe and the Americas. These books explore the myriad ways local, state, and federal governments implemented policies that were driven by business interests. Two organizations performed dominate roles in policy creation - the United States Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Realtors. Both are lobbying groups with incredible power, but together they created the process of redlining and restrictive covenants. These practices assured white homeowners within the redlined districts or under covenants that the neighborhood would remain white. Participating homeowners could not sell their homes to anyone deemed unsuitable, to include just about all immigrants or AA. This meant our cities were incredibly stratified by race, with AA being forced into the most rundown and neglected neighborhoods by these restrictions and the cost of rents. As a consequence, the white business and political communities would point to the ruin and use it as an excuse as to why the two races could never co-mingle, ignoring the fact that local government policies gave AA nowhere else to live.    I can reply to the OP as a historian, and since one of the replies mentions Detroit, I'll suggest one of urban historians' favorite books: Sugrue, Thomas. The Origins of the Urban Crisis : Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. Princeton  N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1996.      Sugrue tracks the decline of Detroit and places the blame squarely on the city's political and economic elite who promoted racist policies that promoted the ghettoization of African Americans in small clusters while whites fled to the suburbs. This is a matter repeated across american cities and I'll provide more books that address this subject:      Hirsch, Eric. Urban Revolt : Ethnic Politics in the Nineteenth-Century Chicago Labor Movement. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990.      Kruse, Kevin. White Flight : Atlanta and the Making of Modern Conservatism. Princeton  N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2005.      Avila, Eric. Popular Culture in the Age of White Flight : Fear and Fantasy in Suburban Los Angeles. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006.      Self, Robert. American Babylon : Race and the Struggle for Postwar Oakland. Princeton  N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2003.      All of these texts reveal the persistence of local government in creating policies that marginalized AA or the poor using housing as an instrument in erecting boundaries designed to keep the elite shielded from the poor. Again, this trend has reversed with rising rents pushing the poor and minorities out of cities and into the suburban landscape.   Religion - it is the evilest invention of humanity. It stifles free thinking, promotes prejudice through difference, and its adherents' claims of moral superiority are ridiculous. For close to 1500 years it kept humanity in a state of intellectual decay that still persists.   USA - love it or leave it.   I wonder if the Koch brothers paid for this study?   NPR   I especially like wet naps.   Please understand that I didn't mean you're "all wrong" because that's not my intention. I'm sure there are a plethora of smart redditors, including yourself, but crowd sourcing the understanding of America's constitution is a risky way to get that information. For example, an individual may know a lot about performing surgery from reading literature about the subject, and even be able to speak the jargon. However, having never performed surgery, would you want this individual opening you up? It's simple for a person to regurgitate information that they learned on the history channel or discovery channel (both are horrible sources), even perhaps on wikapedia, but it's an understanding that's usually ideologically driven by the source, and is suspect. I'm also saying that american media has failed its audience because it no longer informs or challenges the prevailing dogma of contemporary political parties. In many instances a "news" channel will deliberately misinform its viewers to elicit a particular reaction. With such odds stacked against the average american it's no wonder they are poorly informed about their constitutional rights.    This will sound cruel, but that's the problem today with our population's understanding of government. We want the condensed version of things because we're overworked and find our downtime better spent on having fun. I challenge you to dig deeper, because when the light finally comes on in your head, your understanding of the protections offered by our Constitution will result in a feeling of disappointment at where our leaders have taken this country in the past twenty-five years. I am a professional historian so if you'd like a complete list of books on this subject I'd be glad to provide it.   To understand an inkling of the Constitution's authors intent requires reading a historiography on the subject.      A good starting point is Peter H. Irons. A Peoples History of the Supreme Court. New York: Viking, 1999. Irons points out that the US was founded on the notion of law, but it was a law interpreted by the white, wealthy, landholding men, the majority of which were lawyers. The overwhelming problem facing the new government was slavery. "It seemed now to be pretty well understood," Madison said, "that the real difference of interest lay, not between the large and small but between the northern and southern states. The institution of slavery and its consequences formed the line of discrimination." For those who don't know, Madison was the only individual to keep complete notes about the process from start to finish. He was also the engine that drove the process, while Jefferson wasn't even there. He was serving as a diplomat in France when the Constitution was written. Madison's notes were not released until after all the participating members died. From these notes we know that "wealth" was used as an euphemism to describe slaves. His notes reveal the debate about just who should be allowed to vote in this new country. "The delegates argued about who should be allowed to vote in elections, because among the landed classes, those without lands were considered too ignorant to be trusted with voting. To alleviate their fears, the delegates decided that the state's legislators would choose the two members of the Senate, a rule that finally changed in 1913."(p 26)      If we still followed the founders' thinking on government, a much smaller portion of the population would be allowed to vote. I offer this example to highlight that the Constitution's authors were imperfect men who tried to create a form of government that incorporated methods to change or amend the document as the nation grew. Those that argue we should adhere to their founding vision overlook the myopic nature of that vision. Additionally, injecting economic visions on the Constitution's authors is incredibly short sighted as the contemporary economic business model of capitalism was still sixty years away, and they had no idea how it would impact Americans.    Rob the guy robbing the bank, claim reward.   I'm not trying to piss people off, but I also don't believe in participating or enabling a belief in a fantasy.  	199
       the idea of having 2 static second divisions is fucking stupid            how neat would it be to have both groups in MLS? a genuine city rivalry   right? so damn close      Ronaldinho                  given that Picault was the one consistent   meaningful player on the Strikers this season, I'm surprised                                          I find that first draft is just the version with all the mistakes   tangents   ugly notes--a way to puke it all on the page. So I like writing with a pen   paper because it allows for more fluidity. A type-script it usually a second draft, where things are edited both as I type and from the 1st draft/notes               thanks, for the input. [the paperback cover](https://www.createspace.com/5113670) is a bit different. I really dig the pic, which I think is by [William Azcona](https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t31.0-8/s960x960/820841_553538574670517_705785478_o.jpg). I hope you consider picking up the book!                           So early in November I published my first epic fantasy novel, [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/Adversaries-Together-Ascendant-Realms-Book-ebook/dp/B00PB4I5X4/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8 sr=1-1 qid=1416618174). It's swords   sorcery only without the sorcery. I've been able to complete about a third of the second book in the series, which I'm hoping to have available in the early Spring.                                 [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4)   cf97                        an actual fullback would be nice. maybe he'd even get playing time                     no worries. thanks for letting me know details, I appreciate it                     If you're interested in starting a new fantasy series there's [Adversaries Together](https://www.createspace.com/5113670)   If you're interested in starting a new fantasy series there's [Adversaries Together](https://www.createspace.com/5113670)   Part of the siege of one of the cities in [Adversaries Together](https://www.createspace.com/5113670) is based on anecdotes from the siege of Leningrad. Hoping to have the next novel in the series expand on it   If you're interested in starting a new fantasy series there's [Adversaries Together](https://www.createspace.com/5113670)   If you're interested in starting a new fantasy series there's [Adversaries Together](https://www.createspace.com/5113670)               it's not poking your nose. purpose of this network is to ask   socialize. to your question--so far my book's been available for 2 wks as an ebook. not a lot of sales but through KDP I get 70% royalties which is solid. So, will it pay your rent? No. Will it make more money than not publishing? Yes         I'm writing my second fantasy novel now, just self-published the first [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4). Would love to hear your thought, Hannah                                       Here's your resource: http://www.openculture.com/2014/11/download-110-free-philosophy-ebooks-from-aristotle-to-nietzsche-wittgenstein.htm            Anthony Ryan's Blood Song was a big hit recently. And you could try [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4)   [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) Tumbledown, Robert Boswell Girl in the Road, Monica Byrne The Search, Geoff Dyer   Maybe looking into [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4)         I just finished Geoff Dyer's The Search--concise, quick read that's rather fun in that old school gumshoe kind of way   Maybe a fantasy adventure series, [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4)   I'll suggest [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4), more of a fantasy adventure story but without magic just in a strange world   Give [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) a try, easy to approach, get into, set down, and come back to   [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) has seven main characters, three of which are women--a rugged adventurer, a scrappy daughter of an elite, and a priestess who becomes more than what her faith can handle. All of them resist or grow beyond the damsel in distress trope   Why not give [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) a try   I submit [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4)   There are a slew of new ebook series to get into early on like [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4)   I really enjoyed Blood Song, easy to get into and satisfying. Also, [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4)   [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) doesn't have any sex or magic, but it's mostly characters talking and thinking so it's light on gore    If you're interested in a quick read as an ebook that's a new series [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4)   so then what could such a genre be called? Speculative, maybe?   fair point, I'll polish that line.      I wrote what I consider to be a fantasy novel, [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4), but I made it a point to not have any magic. It seems that a lot of folk in the genre are resistant to this idea. Regardless of the quality of my scribbling, I'm wondering what others think. Does a story that's fantasy have to have magic? If it doesn't, is it then sci-fi? If not, what kind of genre would it be?   Blood Song and The Name of the Wind are easily accessible and engaging. I would also say [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4)   I wrote [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) to feature three strong woman leads--one an aggressive adventurer, one a scrappy daughter of a city's leader, and another a nun-like character that sheds her naivete but refuses to compromise her beliefs. All done without having to fall in love or be damsels in distress   [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) is about groups of elites in a fantasy world looking to conquer--one character is looking to take over the world's religion, another wants to become emperor, and a third wants to bring to the world to its knees by dominating it economically   [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) is a fantasy adventure but it has zero magic and centers more around the plots and scheming of elites looking for more power and the common folk enduring them   [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) keeps things platonic, simply people trying forge trusting relationships   Writing [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) I made it a point to work towards a balance of active, meaningful men and women characters that aren't 'in love' but are just people working together   [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) centers around a core of seven characters involved in intrigues of four different nations vying for power   I'd like to think the character Avery Roth in [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) fits this         one of the things I always thought would be cool would be to base fantasy or scifi worlds on the what the continents looked like in deep time. this is part of a small attempt to do so  	137
    I can think of two that looked animatronic and definitely would be easy to do with them. But yeah no massive animatronics for the big dinosaur like JP1.   Don't think you're a cheapass just because you don't pay for video.   Yes! I was dreading that this would turn out like Utopia. I'm not surprised with how much marketing they've done for this though.    This is by far my favourite Paul Scheer character. I was really hoping we would return for Pitch Perfect 2 but sadly no.   Nah they talk about their mother. Also the head girl and Lauren Lapkus talk about orders.   This is the tinchat: http://tinychat.com/khsunny786 and there is a subreddit at /r/teenagerstinychat  EDIT: A lot of people are coming and leaving when they see there is not many people on. If you come on you could just leave it on in the background until some people join :)    the lack of ams and pms in this made me confused.   Yeah but in 2D animation aren't all the mouth shapes sort of ready to go for each character and they just choose whatever one fits for each frame.   What was the spike in 2008 for the Big Bang?  EDIT: Also it's cool the way you can see each season on the Big Bang Theory search. It seems to be decreasing in popularity.   Oh wow I've never heard of them doing that before. Is it difficult? I figured it would be pretty easy nowadays to sync mouths up with different dubs.          In case anyone doesn't know Jake and Amir have a podcast that Benny Schwazzz and Middleditch are sometimes on.  Also does anyone know which Jake and Amir sketch it is where they keep holding up DVDs? I think Schwartz was in it.   Was that Ellie Kemper in the check one?   I can't believe this is a problem he has. It's like complaining about the old animation in the G.I Joe episode. But it's even worse considering the puppet tv shows still mostly have rods. The only thing were they are edited out is probably the latest Muppet movies.   Yay. Most of the time when I put out a video I lose a subscriber or two so I'm glad this one got me some.   Thanks!   Thank you. I though the editing was a bit choppy but it's gotten a very nice response.   Thanks, I made it myself.      Here in Ireland It's Always Sunny has been gaining popularity since it's been added to Netflix.      Yep, if we got the subreddit to the front of /r/teenagers once I'd say it will have people on everynight until the end of summer.    I always thought it was weird how all the sneezing in the whole series took place in one episode.   /r/teenagerstinychat   I have actually heard every episode of Harmontown except for that one. I believe I feel asleep at the start and it seemed Dan wasn't in the best mood. I'll have to go listen to it now I know Adomian came on, thanks very much.   What is this from? I don't remember it in the Comedy Bang Bang episode.   The BOYS have just FIRED RON and the CATSKILLS ARE GOING HAYWIRE.   That's funny because here in Ireland we would associate guns with Texans more than Mexicans.    Is the original that he says "we have lots of Mexicans" or "lots of guns" because the second one works better from an irish standpoint.      I suppose the idea is that he's a comedian and so it has an entertainment value to watch him. It's similar to how most people would be willing to watch a comedian do stand-up but not a normal person.   I'll admit it's not for anyone.      The energy was just about to die and then Benny Schwaz showed up.   I use Downcast but it's been very slow for me lately so I have a question about other podcast apps. When I'm catching up on podcasts I normally listen to 3/4 series at once and I listen to them in the order they were released in. So for example in my current relisten I'm on May 2013. So in downcast I click on Downloaded and all my podcast episodes (doesn't matter the series) are sorted by date. That means I listen to the one at the top.  In past experience podcast episodes were always sorted by the actual podcasts. Has this changed in most other apps?   You get used to it very quickly. Eventually it gets to a point where if you changed to normal speed it all seems in slow motion.   I should add I listen in 1.5 most of the time.       Haha you've not watched "It's Always Sunny" have you? It's pretty dark.   Yeah but it wasn't called that then.      That's what I was thinking. I remember the first time seeing the movie very clearly and being amazed at that first dinosaur scene.   That's because it was Dan Harmon's voice.   I am one of the people who had one of these videos that got sort of popular. I was thinking about doing a post about the information I can get about people who watch these videos on my youtube analytics page. Would anyone be interested?   Wasn't it timely at the time of it originally airing? Edit: Yeah Episode III hadn't come out yet at the original airing of that episode.   I want someone to do a version of the movie like that. I'm sure with the original footage you'd be close.   I'd like a remaster with no dinosaurs.   	47
 You make a good case, son. A damned good case.   Swastikas   On the flip side, however, the military does discriminate against vast segments of the population, so I don't think it's safe to consider it a catchall.   Such liberalism! Such democracy! Good to see that the blood spilt on the maidan was not tragically, farcically wasted. Different faces, same bullshit.  .   ! Glad we ironed that out.   Simonov certainly could have managed it.   Ah! I thought you were talking technically, not conceptually. My mistake.   Nihil sub sole novum, eh?   See, Mikhail Kalashnikov seems like he was an awesome guy, and that's part of his appeal. The Soviets were fond of using poster boys to embody the labor of the working classes. In this system, the [Stakhanovite movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakhanovite_movement), the work of many would be attributed to a single poster boy in the hopes that multitudes of workers would see said poster boy as a model to be emulated. The results of this were debatable, but it is certain that it was applied to more than just coal mining.   Except that the internal workings of the two weapons are wholly different. The StG has much more in common with European assault rifles than it does the AK-47. While they're aesthetically similar, the inner workings of the two machines couldn't be more different.   I'm sure it's already been said, but my only problem with the theory is how much Bobby looks like Cotton. Otherwise, this theory has been my operating headcanon for quite some time.   Well? It is, isn't it? It was mostly in what is now Russia and what holdings it had on Crimea count as Russian because we all know the Ukraine ain't getting that soil back.   But that's why this is wrong. A boycott would be saying that you care more about some people's issues than others. That's tremendously unethical.   I see what you're saying, but I still believe that those who support such a move are failing to consider people with disabilities and poor people, as well as anybody else who can't travel. I take issue with that on a lot of levels.   But why should people unable to do anything about it suffer for it? DC should just make donations to Democratic candidates or something. A boycott would hurt a ton of people to no real end. You can't fix an injustice with another injustice.   No matter what, moving is going to be a pain for people who had nothing to do with this. I hope the law fails, but if it passes I'm going to be pissed if Dragoncon moves and, unfortunately, won't be able to do a thing about it.  That said, they'll need a strong argument to get them out of their contracts.  Also, thanks for the upvote.   I get what you're saying, I'm just saying that it wouldn't hold up and any half decent lawyer could defeat that argument in arbitration.   "Hey, let's screw over our con goers for something they have no control over!" That would be, essentially, what they're saying if they moved and that is something nobody should condone. The waves they're making are at our expense, not theirs. If they want to sacrifice for the good of the cause, they can contribute to non Republican political campaigns. Don't shaft the disabled and the poor over it.    Dragoncon itself has never been hostile to gay people. This argument falls flat.   But I'm disabled. Traveling is a huge ordeal for me, bordering on impossible if it's too far. I don't take people's shit away and bother them for issues relating to disabilities. Theirs is an awful approach to activism that ends up hurting people who actually genuinely are on their side. Additionally, a lot of people can't afford to travel to Dragoncon and this is the only large genre convention of its size and type that we've got.   You would be hard pressed to find anti gay sentiment at Dragoncon. Do something that'll hurt the republicans directly or something.  I'm probably going to get buried, but people need to consider the full ramifications of boycotts.   tl;dr, no just read the damn thing.  Edit: downvotes? Is arguing for those who can't travel that detestable? Such tolerance!   If you sycophant hard enough, though, you could get a cushy dacha or something.   Stalin had the best mixtape of 1944, foreal.   Travel is a huge ordeal for me and Dragoncon has always been very convenient because of that. Let's not punish allies for the actions of boor headed conservatives.   Not to mention Target's whole, creepy history in customer tracking anyway...   Except for all the gay people and allies in Indiana suffering for this anyway. Sanctions and boycotts are really shitty that way.   Paging /u/StuartAshen. Be careful with your festering, expired food that might somehow be dangerous!   Hey, Andy, how far is Bikini Bottom from Rapture? How are diplomatic relations between these two undersea citystates?   Stolen land? Have you ever even spoken to a Crimean?   Because yours is an interesting country with a rich culture and history that our media does absolutely no justice to. The best way to learn about any country is to ask the people who live there. Thus, I am subscribed.   Greetings from the United States state of Georgia.   I could have sworn that was straight from Dworkin's festering gob. Oh well.   Didn't some radfem "scholar" of some renown once claim that all male sex is rape? I want to say it was Dworkin.   Sounds beautiful compared to current. I'll never get why people think we're better off without the Soviet Union.   I get the perception that a lot of people are worried about the con getting too family friendly and losing the nerdi-gras vibe. People get defensive about that, and I can see more underage attendees worrying them.   No need to put "DPR" in quotes. They've just as much right to their name as anybody else.   Of course not, but I hear far too many feminists claiming their movement is about *everybody's* gender equality, and I take umbrage with that assertion. It's quite clear that this is not the case and they should stop selling their movement as such a thing.    But if feminism really is about gender equality, shouldn't it just be called "gender equality?" Where are feminists on male issues?    Default mod, here. I've never spoken with her. She seems to be hands off, from what I can tell. Well, other than blanket bans on discussion of a certain con artist.    I love how everyone preaches that we should be politically correct and sensitive to every single minority ever, but it's perfectly fine to call the south as a whole one crazy set of backwards, raving, religious lunatics.  I see it all the damned time and it pisses me off. You can't joke about anyone ever because feelings. But the South? Oh, go right ahead! We're the national laughing stock and we just have to deal with it.    ***WHAT!?***   What was the original?   When comics work dried up, Rob Liefeld moved into tattoo commissions.    Zelotic, dropping some knowledge bombs.   9x18 Makarov.    I can vouch for this. A friend of mine once shot a handgun while I had my earplugs out. Not a fun trip to the range, let me tell you.   I'm going to go out on a limb and say that if we're going to have executions, they ought to be public. I am against the death penalty, as I don't believe any nationstate to have a perfect enough judicial process to mete it out fairly and it's an extremely expensive thing to have around.  However, it is a civil process, and every citizen of a country ought to see how the sausage is made, so to speak. As an element of the justice system, such as open courts where such executees are sentenced, it ought to be done in public.   I can't imagine Ogelthorpe landing in South Georgia in anything but a blizzard and considering this state fit to establish any sort of colony, even a penal colony.   Simply put, people will be quick to find ways for truly horrible things to be hoaxes. It's easier to some than accepting that we live in a world where awful things happen for no good reason.  Besides, the anti gun lobby HAS been milking the hell out of it, and where someone is gaining, people are quick to look for blame.   Because their government is in disarray and the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing?   temporary occupied  Oh, that's cute.   I guess Kosovo isn't a state either, then. Or maybe being a nation has to do more with sovereign will than petty things like international recognition. I mean, if Transnistria isn't sovereign and it isn't run by Moldova, just what the devil is it?   I thought he was Jimmy.  Ol' Jimmy Palpatine.   Woo!   But Transnistria is an independent nation. The Ukraine has no right to interfere and its citizens shouldn't need to get Moldovan passports.   July? You could relocate to the surface of the sun and it would be more temperate than Georgian July.   Nah. I like it here, for all of its faults. My family has been here since the early 1800s, the culture appeals to me, and moving is expensive. I'll just crank my AC and don a cooled HAZMAT suit to leave my apartment, all while dreaming of some Dixie Siberia.   No! Now we have bugs, pollen, and swamp ass! Anything but winter in this state is a hellish slog through the blood soaked depths of perdition.   I can get that their trying to help their branding, but you don't do that by shafting one of your most productive employees. Poor form, Konami.   Your host is bad and you should feel bad. Full of redirect spam and everything on phones. Lousy. Stop using it.   I'm out of the loop, here. What did Konami do to Kojima?   Because you haven't got a horse in this race or anything.   I can't think of anything off the bat that could contradict this. Headcanon tentatively accepted.   "Sorry, dude." Never has a simple phrase been so infuriating. I'd have taken a bat to his face and irradiated his testicles if I was you.   I may well do that if no one gets to it first. I'm busy for the weekend, so I can't give it the time it deserves.   ShitRedditSays is most toxic? So unsurprised.   I have some aesthetic and story pointers, if you'd like to avail yourself of them. I've been dying to do a setting like this but haven't really had a way to do it.   Dieselpunk space opera! If I could see art deco capital ships slugging it out over an ecumenopolis where everyone has spiffy 1930s era uniforms, that'd be neato. I actually have quite a few ideas kicking around about this.   Because censorship is really annoying to some people?   Georgia here. Yeah, I'm nowhere near that brave. I keep my bumper stickers sci fi related.   Southern atheists: there are more of us than you'd think. Source: Georgia bound and god-free.   I think General Lee was always aware of the morally abhorrent nature of slavery, but he was overwhelmed by his love of Virginia - surpassing even his love of the United States. I think his moral nature must have eaten at him quite badly and he would definitely have been a very conflicted man during and after the war.   Everything Kiev does seems to make me want to hate the current administration in the Ukraine more and more every day.   That's really not their decision to make, is it?   Fuck yes. So pumped.   Burnblades? Sounds fun. I'm on mobile, but is there a Halopedia link?   I am not death myself, but I'm working on it. What can I do to help the cause, buddy?   I never understood why the Lamas and Tibetan independence are so popular with the western Left. It's a tremendously uneducated view of history to support such things.   I got my hopes way too raised over that.   Craplanta? Living near Atlanta, I can see that. So how about San Antonio Bay?   I always liked Detoilet more. Whatcha got for Atlanta?   Anyone want to design one for us and fill the void?   My girlfriend's grandfather fought with the Communists against the Japanese in the war. I can confirm that they would hate it. We'd probably end up with a rump state headed by Wang Jingwei's Guomindang in China seated in Shanghai or perhaps Nanjing and the surrounding area with Japan owning a huge swatch of China including Manchuria, perhaps Beijing and most of the northern areas of the country. Additionally, they'd hold Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and more.   Their vassal states in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere would hold Indochina, Burma, Indonesia, Singapore, and most if not all of British India. Look for Subhadra Bose and his Japanese backers to have some very different ideas on where the final borders should end up.   *exasperated grunt*   Yep. I believe their intent was to depopulate the Soviet Union as completely as possible and destroy all traces of Russian culture, leaving behind a servile slavic remnant to act as factory labor and house slaves. If memory serves, something to that effect was already somewhat underway in the Ukraine by the time the Nazis were pushed out.   Reichskommisariat Moskau would likely not be a thing. The Nazis stated repeatedly that they wanted to wipe the city and everything it stood for off the map. Likely, they'd set up an administration in Leningrad, rename it Petrograd or some German equivalent, and set up the Gau for the region there.   They dug up his sister just to sling mud at him? What a disgusting cult.   But... But at the two minutes hate yesterday... I could have sworn we...   Crimea's Curse? Could this article be more slanted?   G4 hasn't been a thing in ages. This comic is very dated.    Ukrainian support never fell bolow 50%.  What? Do you even have any idea what you're talking about? Have you ever even met a Crimean?   This. People act like Russia is so hypocritical with regards to secession due to how they handled Chechnya, but the fact that Chechen rebels always wanted to set up a backwards caliphate should set it apart. No conscientious leader can allow a caliphate to arise on their territory.   Sad but true. Things like this don't fit the narrative.   I'm gonna need more info. I had no idea this was a thing.   Such is life.   I used to volunteer at the Maryland zoo. One of the polar bears in our zoo, Alaska, was born in captivity and was in a circus for all of her life. She was rescued and my mentor described what it was like when she first entered her exhibit. The first time she entered her exhibit was literally the first time in her life that she had ever set foot on the earth so, for the first week or so she loved to dig. It was very endearing and touching...until they realized she was digging way too much and they had to fill in the holes at night with a mini tractor and compact the earth. And when she first went for a swim in the pool in her exhibit she was even happier. It was amazing! Unfortunately she has died due to old age and kidney failure.  [link](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-01-15/features/bs-md-zoo-polar-bear-dies-20130115_1_mexican-circus-ellen-bronson-maryland-zoo)   I could buy that.   No, I actually got your point rather clearly. However, as what you said had pretty much nothing to do with my reasons for carrying, I saw no reason to address your comment.   I thought it was canon if you did enough mental gymnastics. I mean, nothing in BaS ever directly shot it down and they even referred to some BioShock 2 locations in game.    And the wheelchair doesn't make much of a difference.  It actually does. The entire point I was trying to make, which seems to have eluded you, is that I can't run from muggers and other scum as easily as others. As such, I feel a lot better using lethal defense. Unless you have a severe mobility impairment as well, you have absolutely no business critiquing that.   This article struck a lot of chords with me. Sterling find as always, /u/alllie.   I've also long been in favor of reopening our State mental hospitals. Europe has proven to have somewhat imitable models in this regard.  I should have included something like that in my initial post, considering  how shockingly and depressingly prevalent mental illness and infirmity are in America's homeless population.   Well, branch 09 in Bombay have finally delivered their Eva sir, but... um... Well, it's got no paint, is fighting off massive infections, its armor has rusted through nearly completely and we can't understand a thing the Eighth Child is saying due to his accent. Can we ask the Angels for a rain check, sir?   Why the Star Wars font?   To play devil's advocate here, a lot of places do this because they lack the resources to shelter and care for those homeless people. Where are they all going to go to the bathroom, for example? Where will they sleep? How are you going to deal with the increased crime, vagrancy and litter that inevitably follows groupings of homeless people? The actions taken to discourage homeless gatherings by some cities is understandable, but it also has to come with a program of humanitarian assistance: the construction and expansion of shelters and resources to get these people fed and in jobs.   Counterargument: I'm in a wheelchair. I can't really fight all that well and I can't flee for shit due to my awful mobility. I can't afford to trust anything *but* lethal measures for self defense.   *ding*  *ding*  *ding*  *soda bottle explodes*    Obeeeeyyy!!!   He's a different animal entirely. I think he's beyond grouping.   Thanks!   Sauce?   It holds water, I think. Only an ignorant fool would think the government has no influence on the news cycle.   Well, that's an example of might makes right, the way you describe it.   Yeah, but Reddit and the US at large will never see this side of the argument.   Law is irrelevant if it doesn't conform to the will of the people. Crimeans don't want to be a part of the Ukraine, so they shouldn't be a part of the Ukraine. End of story.   And where can we buy it?   I am insanely eager to see how this turns out. If nobody comes up with something in a few hours, I'll try to come up with something.   Stick it in some milsurp furniture and she'll look like a champ. 3 my refinished WASR with Romanian donkey dong furniture.   Well, yeah. Yours doesn't?   It sure seems to be a contest, the way some tumblrs tack on as many acronyms as they can to avoid it.   Anyway, living in the rural south, I have to wonder: what use is a shaky, ill defined concept to me if it does nothing to help the people around me and makes everyone feel terrible and guilty? I could make the leap across the chasm of illogical stupidity if it at least helped the people around me.   Privilege is a vague concept, at best. It does little to explain rampant poverty in predominantly white rural Appalachia, for example. It also does little to explain why social justice people seem to care so little for that cause, or for things like male mental health. Privilege is an interesting theory in abstract but makes little sense in the real world.  I say this as a disabled man, someone you'd probably consider unprivileged.    What in the actual fuck?   Headcanon accepted, but it doesn't really answer OP's question.   I applaud you on that, then.    I don't want to sound like a fascist, but if America offends you then you might not have any business being in America. I get that a lot of people can't afford to leave or anything, but the impression I got was that it was primarily immigrants being offended. Generally, you probably shouldn't move to a country if it offends you.   That said, our government is absolutely awful, but a flag usually represents a land and its people, not its government.    As a subscriber here and to /r/personalfinance, I was fairly confused.   In the same vein, trigger warning.   -111 points and three hours up? Wow. It takes integrity to leave such a thoroughly slaughtered post up.   Looks legit to me.   If you'd read below this comment, you'd see that I smoothed that out  with strawberryblonde yesterday.   Don't they have immigration requirements and doesn't it take money to get up there, bud?   And we'll never get that time back. Sad. :(   Sure. Let me just make more money, bud. Oh, and get rid of the medical and opportunity costs of my disability. That will help.      My apologies. That's a rather common thing for anti-gun people to trot out in gun discussions, so I sort of assumed what was going on here.    What's with anti-gun people and their fixation on tiny dicks? Can you lot not do any better than miserable ad hominem attacks?   I wasn't trying to argue with you or anything. Just pointing out that cops aren't always all that good with firearms, yet they're the ones that anti-gun people say should be allowed to have them.  As for the whole criminal justice thing, it actually is something of a source. It shows that I know what I'm talking about to a degree when it comes to police firearms training procedures.   But if you want to be a dick, that's fine too.   A lot of cops are actually really awful with firearms. Escalation of force procedure and trigger discipline don't get near the level of attention they deserve during training.   Source: criminal justice major, studied Georgia's POST training regimen.    Was it night? Near a city? Did the gun owner have to walk anywhere? Sure, the school might be safe, but we don't know where the guy was from or where he was going. If he had a gun on him, to comply with the law, he'd have to wear it openly. I doubt they had a gun check, in any case.    I'd say it's more like keeping a fire extinguisher in your kitchen and by your electric panel even though you're not all that likely to have a fire.   Nah. Marchie lives in a place where grenades abound but nobody can count correctly.   Poor, poor Marchie.    Get over your loss.   Which loss, dare I ask?    Appealing to emotion is such a political way to argue. It's sort of like, you know, every debate about gun ownership ever.   "Yeah, you may have an enumerated constitutional right to own and carry weapons, and gun owners by and large are responsible and trustworthy people BUT WHAT ABOUT DEAD CHILDREN!?" - Bloomstein Demands Whatever   I carry because I'm in a wheelchair, can't fight or flee for shit, and live in a high crime area. As soon as the world stops being a place where people need to defend themselves, I'll stop carrying.   That's a mature attitude that contributes a lot to the conversation. Thanks, webby.   That's a big deal to them? I live in Georgia and work retail. I've got about a million and seven customers who open carry every day. Nice folk, actually. Really friendly, love to talk about their guns and stuff. Michigan, you need to stop being so afraid of weapons.   I didn't need feels of this magnitude today, but by jingo 'ave I got them.    Is it still cel shading if it looks like an impressionist painting?   This is the best way to go about it. Even better is that if you black out while playing, you can wake up to wonder why Balmora is wiped out, a nude Nord is following you around and all of your ingredients have been consumed.   Most definitely. If it's a bullshit booze law, you can always find bible shit behind it.   That sounds awesome. All of that. I'm sort of envious and wish we weren't so sensitive about everything.   Yep. Nazi chic. In Japan and East Asia, nobody was really all that affected by the holocaust, so they look at Nazis as little more than bad guys who did bad things and looked fantastic doing them. Due to their detachment from the situation, it's seen merely as taboo and not endorsing racism and genocide to enjoy Nazi chic. Oh, and the swastika never got ruined over there.  This is a gross over simplification, of course, so if anyone wants to correct me on this, feel free.   I haven't been a fan of CGI animated Star Wars in general. I just can't watch it, it looks awful to me.   I could swear there's an SCP like that.   Anyone got this wallpaper?  	153
 It's the clarity of communication.   Sure we can write - u r da best at or job - and you will understand what I am saying, however it does take a second to process.

I must dropped the price of one of my works as a bonus with the release of my latest book coming this week. Does that count?  Usually they don't drop because of the cost to make and distribute books. If you look into the profit an author makes with each sale you will find the majority are less than a dollar per book. Even at a sale price of twenty dollars.    I just reduced the price on my e-book, The Event, if you are interested. It was my first full length novel with a dark side. And I have the full collection of -Future Jumper Series- coming out this week. E-book and print.   What are you writing? Anything you care to share?   Or  a really small man...   You might want to take a look at The Event. While I admit I am biased, I did write it with one thought in mind, what if the hero doesn't win?    I have 11 titles under my name atm.    Books!

Can't say it worked, but we sold it to that same lady. She told us it "Just felt like a good family home."    Missed the double light. That's bad... You are right about Francis's line. Didn't sit right with me either, so I am glad to see it wasn't just me.   I don't care for the last tag line. It did feel...forced. But the worlds unbound needs to be in there somewhere.   Jump(ed) removed.  Fire (is) added.   Have been pointed out to me. Any others?    Reddit, you have all been incredibly helpful to me with the work I am doing on may latest book. If I could impose, one more time, on your good graces. Please, take a look at this and simply answer, would you buy this book, or does something in the blurb turn you off.   It started with science, and ended the earth.   Aiden and Jess thought they were only doing experiments with light. They had no idea what would happen when they broke the speed of light while bouncing a laser off the moon.    Using jumps through time Aiden tried to fix what he broke and save humanity, only to draw others into his ruined future. Each jumped pulled another victim caught in Aiden's bubbles of time.   Jane, her life of torment driving her to suicide.  Casey, an adventure seeker, living life for the thrills.  Francis, always on the run, fire her closest friend.  And Aiden's girlfriend Jess, the reason for him to continue trying even after humanity turns against him.   In this, the finale of the Past Jumper series we find out if Aiden can break out of his cycle, or will the worlds become forever unbound.    They look like a variant of the PH3614 standard fram.

I know I got a confirmation when I signed up, but nothing came for me to send to.   I am disappointed, I really wanted to put a smile on some strangers face, yet for some reason that I don't know, I wasn't allowed.  I find myself angry, yet I can't explain why. I shouldn't be.

Has a rather profound effect on humanity as we know it.   Throw in some fantasy and boom. You have an epic read.   I used an unknown solar flare resetting the entire earth to pre-history times. It worked for my book. And if you do some research in the sun's history, you would be surprised at how easily it could kill us all.    Like almost EVERY spot on Reddit says. Use Imgur to post pictures.   Read it. Learn it. Use it.    Imagine Dragons = Radioactive.  Also, it will be the background music for my book trailer, if and when I can find a way to record the footage I want to make.   You have to calibrate your mouse, or you have a game pad installed?

As a man who has been bitten in the past, leave now. If there isn't a way to spend time in the same room as this person, everything you "know" could be a lie.   I was used and abused for almost a year by a friend I fell for, in the end she was married and her husband and her were using me for personal entertainment.  Cut your losses, move on, find a person who you can see in front of you, smile with, hold hands, and talk to.   Well we do have good health care. However, just being up here doesn't make everything better.   I tore a ligament in my shoulder and it still took over 2 years to get fixed. If it's just for the health care alone, you might want to look very closely. If you are that hard up, getting a job up here might be tough. Unless of course you are already wealthy.     As a Canadian, yes. Of course, why would you want to? Isn't that a decision that you should be making from your own point of view?   I couldn't resist throwing that in there.       You have to DL to watch this? BOO!   Blood...She wanted more.   It was a strange experience. The minute the helicopter lifted off and left me behind, the entire island went silent.   I could still see the mainland from where I was left on the beach. The white sand disappeared into the starlight blue of the ocean. They told me before they left I shouldn't try swimming for it. I might make it a few hundred feet before the sharks got me. Almost at command, I watched a fin break the surface a moment before silently dipping back below to the depths. With a gulp, I turned back towards my goal, my future, my death.   The sands stretched out in front of me to the line of trees that seemed impenetrable. This was insane, yet given the options it was the only choice I could take.   In a moment of clarity, I remembered the magistrate standing above me as he passed sentence.   "You have been given the black ticket. For your crimes, you have the choice of a swift death now, or the opportunity to earn your freedom on exclusion." "Exclusion." I had stammered the word before I could think about what I was agreeing to.   Now I was left to fight against the islands turmoil of genetically modified animals, and twist one into submission, or die trying.   The simple blade they had supplied me with felt heavy in my hands as I willed my feet to move me to the tree line. It wasn't a choice. Death was rumored to live at every bend on this island. The animals here were the remnants of the gene splicing experiments of 2078.   The activists had insisted that the animals not be killed, yet they were entirely too dangerous to be let loose where people could be harmed. This was the compromise. If only the activists knew what the government was doing now. They would shit themselves.   The worst offenders like myself were given the option to try to tame an animal or die trying. I had heard one woman had done it. Yet, rumors were she didn't live long after. If it was the government that had gotten rid of her, or her pet, no one in the prison could tell me for sure.   A branch broke under my foot sending a single shot of noise through the underbrush. Fuck. My palms started to sweat around the synthetic leather grip of the knife. Cows had been extinct for twenty years. Real leather was too expensive to waste on a dead convict.   I scanned the area to see if anything had heard my mistake and only silence came back in response. As I waited for my heart rate to slow, I saw a flicker of movement off to my side. I twisted my head around and was rewarded with the source of the movement.   A squirrel sat on a log stone still and stared at me with tiny black eyes. I couldn't believe my luck. Since the majority of dogs had died out in the poisoned air sweep of 2029 people had taken to smaller animals as pets. Squirrels had proved remarkably easy to tame, and the new market they created had swept the world with an entirely new field of clothing, toys, and habitats. They were all custom made to fill the void left behind in the pet field. If I was going to have any chance at getting off this island alive, it was sitting right in front of me, right now.   A quick survey of the ground around me left me with a tiny selection of berries and seeds. The guide had mentioned that food was plentiful here. It was a minor shock to see how plentiful. In a passing thought, I wondered why it would be like this with so many animals around, but with a mental shrug, I dismissed the notion, it wasn't important. Taming this squirrel was important.   Careful not to spook him away I first placed a berry on my hand and held it out to him. I watched for a reaction as I carefully stretched my hand forward. Only a gentle twist of the animals head came in response. I dropped the berry and tried a nut hoping for a more favorable result.   With each item I presented, the squirrel only gave a minor shift of his head, not a negative twist, more of a curiosity. Perspiration built up on my forehead as I presented item after item.   It didn't work. I felt my legs start to shake from sitting still for so long and I stared at the squirrel on the log in front of me. In frustration, I broke the silence and cursed the fuzzy fiend. "What the hell do you eat you little bastard!" With uncanny speed, he shot forward and bit the tip of my outstretched hand. My leg muscles convulsed as I fell to the side. A tiny drip of blood pooled on my fingertip where the rodent's teeth had broken my skin. The world around me went out of focus as I watched the deep red turn to a purple and then a black.   I tried to move away, but my body wouldn't listen to my mind. I tried to scream, but no words escaped my lungs. Before my eyes completely glazed over I saw the tiny black eyes of the squirrel stare at me from on top of that log. Moments later another pair, and then another had joined it.   As I fell to the ground with a dull thump, I understood why the squirrel didn't except any of my offerings, and that's why food was so plentiful on the island. They didn't eat any of it.    I made so many maps in my youth, it was part of what made the games so fun. I used to keep a binder full of them. Fantasy Star was one I believe, I mapped the entire end dungeon.   I handed my controller to my 6 yr old son, and showed him what button to push, he won every fight.    You are very welcome! And I think I have it pretty nailed down. I am getting good feedback here, as well as on my professional page on FB. People really like that one.    I don't mind at all. However in this instance the lady has some more effects that flip over to the back cover. This sample doesn't show the other side since I was just working on my e-book cover first.   It does look good, all though somewhat pixelated...any practice is good practice though!    Awesome suggestions, thank you. I will really consider this before the final draft.   The girl, and the fire, are pivotal in this, the final chapter of the series.  The by has been removed, however I am still working on the cropping. It may (will?) end up as a paperback as well, so the cover image you see has her hand sweeping to the left and an open black area for the blurb placement. I have been playing with fonts, but as of yet I am unable to find one that truly seems to flow. It has been offered I should use a fire, but that...would be too much.   As for the series # I don't have much choice. I have had too many readers pick up a book out of order and than leave a negative review because it didn't make any sense. If I don't hit a reader in the face with what book number it is, well...  Thank you for your input, it is consistent with almost everything else that I have heard. I will repost a finished product in an update as soon as it is done. Hopefully to better praise!    Again, it doesn't apply, but you were honest in your answer...so TADA!   http://y2jgfx.deviantart.com/art/Randy-Orton-Man-On-Fire-161569370   As of right now. No...but you know what...that's an interesting idea.   It doesn't tie in with the female character that has an affinity for fire...but there is a strong male character who controls the wind.   I might have to think on that one. Thank you!       It is strong choice for many, the one with a human model looked great in my mind, I just couldn't get it to work on the screen. The silhouette sample works as she is blowing fire onto the back cover but the front would be solo for e-book version.  Thank you for your input!   Here are the 3 samples I have so far. I have the left images hidden since they don't really need to be shown at this stage.   What do you think? Suggestions? Ideas? Anything you would change on them? All input welcome.       Now #1 in the Time category and in the top 2000 for free!   Thank you everyone for helping get the word out.    You have mail! ;) Enjoy!    You are very welcome. I have had fun writing the series.    What country? Amazon has some funky rules. I will send you a PDF if you PM me.       I don't think so. Just for fun and to learn to plan ahead.

I walk past a funeral home every once in a while. I don't know why, but this poem came into my head today and I just had to write it somewhere.   Thank you for reading taking the time to read it.   I do not lie here, this is not me.  My soul has left, those close to me see.  The body remains, the person is gone.  Do not miss me, that would be only wrong.  Be happy in spirit. No matter the cost.  Your heart must be brave, this is only a grave.       And thank you! I will let you know how the next one goes, I started it four years ago, just picking it up again...who knows, maybe it will be next year?!?!   My first book, yes. Two to be exact.   My second, no, four months.  My third, it's just been finished and took over two years again.   So...yes, and no.    My best friend Plank. It's an old funny video.

 I've heard that 5-15 year old Mazdas rust like hell in Canada.   http://imgur.com/a/SCRvS   I don't really think of this view that way. What I mean is the potential to help out overpopulation a bit is the reason why I think things such as driving without a seatbelt on should be legal.      They did a surprisingly good job.         FWD: 1971-72 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz  RWD: Mercedes S65 AMG  AWD: R32 Nissan Skyline GTS-4      Most muscle cars from 1974-84. Such as the Chevy Cosworth Vega, Olds 442, and Volare based Road Runner.   and this Ferrari, http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-23/wrecked-ferrari-sells-for-250-000-basquiat-5-million   I agree, I feel safer when I don't have to rely on technology to drive.   Its the same car, before the fire.      That's what I thought, driver aids and other electronics, but otherwise the difference between 2005 and 2015 cars seems quite small when compared to say, 1955 vs 1965 or 1985 vs 1995 cars.         Infiniti Q50, Cadillac XTS, Mercedes C/E, Lexus LS/GS/ES/IS are all good choices. Also check out /r/whatcarshouldibuy.   What's wrong with a wall of text?      [Yup.](http://jalopnik.com/the-six-best-unreliable-cars-you-can-buy-from-carmax-1687770994)   A 5-7 year old C-Class might not be the most pleasant when its time for repairs, but should be less expensive than an E or S class. If this worries you, I would recommend finding one with lower miles or trying to find one from Carmax if you can, since they warranty all their used cars.  http://www.carmax.com/search?ANa=283 D=90 zip=11050 N=4294963073 Q=ce08978e-3b29-41c9-82e6-f3b2289c56e0 Ep=search:results:results  Edit: Unfortunately they don't seem to have any AWD in stock.   2008-10 Mercedes-Benz C300s and C350s were available in manual with AWD.

Chevy Suburban, Tahoe, GMC Yukon.   and why most German cars in the northeast are now all wheel drive.   I feel like even though enthusiasts complain about some cars being FWD, most buyers could care less. For example, a non-enthusiast cross shopping a FWD Audi A8 and a RWD Mercedes S550 is probably more concerned with amenities and badge prestige than they are with which wheels propel the car.   This is getting old and annoying.   Should be cheaper to maintain than similar German cars.      01-06 Infiniti Q45   But it was likely not the texter's first time texting and driving. This was just a fender bender, but sometimes texting while driving can be just as dangerous as drunk driving.   These posts are kind of old, but are still good examples of what I mean. Both did something pretty dangerous, and likely not for the first time, but the difference in how in one there is a lot of flaming and in the other one the commenters take on the attitude of "Sorry you messed up, good thing your car looks nice again" seems interesting to me.

BMW 1M: The future classic that is already appreciating.   AMG GT   Nissan Skyline GXi  BMW 316d  4 cylinder Chevy Nova  1975 Dodge Charger   Yeah, if this were 1975.   Buick Regal GS         Meant to write LR2, the other name for the Freelander.   It was silver.   The XF is pretty nice looking, but took some getting used to since it is such a radical departure from traditional Jaguar styling. I strongly agree on the Freelander, that thing looks like a poorly restyled, overpriced, Ford Escape.      They sell very few and most people don't see the appeal of a "luxury Kia". They should've developed a separate luxury brand.   A few days ago, I saw a 99-02 E55 AMG driver going 80+ mph on the highway and driving like an asshole in general. I think that the reason why he drove like this is because he thinks that since it's an AMG, it feels like a supercar to this douche, when in reality it's a 15 year old, 350 hp, mid-level luxury sedan.   For some reason, I think that the Hyundai Genesis and Equus sedans, and the Kia K900 look like they would be more at home in a video game like GTA, Saints Row, or Watch Dogs than the would in real life. I'm guessing it must be because of how they are an amalgamation of different familiar designs.   The problem isn't that it's a bad car, the problem is that by not marketing it properly, making it too expensive, and not making a manual available, they have screwed up it's potential at being a popular car. I have only ever seen one in person.

Isn't it usually the other way around?   Population control   Long Island, NY   I saw a girl around here drive this 90s Sentra for about six months with really bad rear end damage. The trunk lid was smashed in and didn't look like it could close or open, bumper was split, taillight lenses cracked, and lots of duct tape. This is in a state with yearly inspections.    Edit: Also once saw an elderly man driving an 80s Olds Cutlass that was completely covered in rust, as if it had sat in a pond, and dragging its tail, as if there were a few bodies in the trunk, going 10 under the speed limit.   Edit: Your rolling wrecks and the speed they go sound 10x worse, sounds like you live in a third world county.   /r/murica      With the way MB styling has been going, I hope it's better than the current facelifted E.      Tata or Tatra?      Last year my aunt called a W126 a "15 year old Mercedes". Also, one time when I was 11 I saw a 560SEC and thought it was a newer car (this was 07-08ish).   Many German cars (W210, E38, etc.) and the LS400 also. I would never mistake any of these, or the NSX or Supra, as well as the Skyline for new cars, but they don't yet appear to stand out in traffic as "old" looking. Part of it might also be because I'm a child of the late 90s-early 00s and the designs still seen normal to me.      I strongly agree on the Cadillacs, but I think the 3 series BMWs have aged pretty well in some cases.   Reminds me of this early 80s Mercury Grand Marquis I've seen driving around with a Regan-Bush sticker.      As the CA government is always concerned with the environment, I'm guessing that due to pressure from enthusiasts with older cars who don't regularly use them, they've decided to compromise by making them pay a fee to avoid smog testing, while also not making it any easier for people who are broke to keep their old clunkers on the road.   http://japanesenostalgiccar.com/2015/04/16/ca-bill-to-allow-fee-payment-instead-of-smog-test-introduced/   - Lamborghini Countach (formerly)  - Maserati Quattroporte  - 190E 2.6  - 1990s S600  - 1976 and 1981 Chrysler New Yorkers  - Chevy Camaro IROC convertible  - Some kind of 60s-70s Mercedes that never leaves the garage.

I would consider raising him as a girl instead if you think this would have a good outcome. I figure that we will treat him as a girl and not tell him he's really a boy. Put him in dresses, grow his hair long, give him dolls to play with, etc. I  believe that when puberty comes testosterone will make "her" into a "girl" who is, bigger and stronger than most actual females, giving "her" an advantage in sports. I am also hoping that her masculine features will deter boys from wanting to date her when reaching high school age. Will this work and have you ever tried something like this?      The V12 S600s are also very complex and expensive to maintain, making an earlier trip to the scrapper more likely, but I don't think that most of the W140s produced are S600s.   My first thought was how out of place it seemed there. Perhaps it was originally a military import.         I have watched a lot of police pursuits on TV and the internet and when I saw a foot chase recently that was recorded by helicopter, where the suspects were out of sight of ground cops for some time, I noticed a manhole. I then wondered why no one ever hid in the sewer to evade in these videos, wouldn't that put them out of sight of the helicopter?      If you ever go to a poor area, you will likely see older Lincolns and other ratty luxury cars with broken air suspension. They scrape, ride high, bounce up and down going over potholes, and sometimes have one side far higher up in the air than the other.   They were largely purchased by elderly people, often as their very last car. This means that low-mile, well maintained examples, available at low prices are not hard to find. If you live in Florida or another warm state, it is likely that they were only driven half the year.   Its the supermarket storebrand F F.   I remember hearing about this being a big issue for Mercedes-Benz owners in the 1980's, but recently, I have been seeing a few Mercedes-Benzes and one Cadillac driving around with the grille emblems yanked out. I remember seeing a small, sudden amount of them about six months ago, but yesterday, I saw three, two MBs and the Cadillac, all late model. Do the emblems have any resale value or does somebody just think its fun to be a dick?   70s-80s full size American cars.   1988 Lincoln Town Car   Both are Mercedes-Benz imitations built by mid-range brands and sold for a comparatively lower price, with lower quality.

All would be kept stock looking.   Think about it. All those muscle cars seemed old and impractical back then, as well as earlier. Today, the E30 M3, and some other 1980s European sports cars still seem practical for daily driving and feel somewhat modern. Also, it seems like I perceived the 60s-70s as longer ago back then than I perceive the 80s as being now.            I'm surprised to see the XTS here. It seems relatively popular around here. Not terribly common, but far from rare.   Trans Am WS6   Both are Mercedes-Benz imitations built by mid-range brands and sold for a comparatively lower price, with lower quality.

I don't see it, to me it looks as much like the current S Class as the W124 looked like a W140.   When the W212 first came out, I thought it was ugly and felt disappointed that the W211 out of production, but then it grew on me.   Just thought of this, how about a vintage VW Bus, or a Vanagon.   Pontiac Aztek   I have a professor who has a fear of rodents. If this were available as a t-shirt, I would wear it to her class.         I once saw a highly modified 55' Chevy that had been put on a 96' Caprice chassis.   A few weeks ago, I came across a user who has posted various radical and nonsensical opinions, including [this one] (http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2ywoot/dad_smuggles_baby_in_plastic_bag_out_of_hospital/cpdnfvq?context=3), and has been showered in downvotes because of how crazy what he writes is. He is apparently a [sovereign citizen] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement) and sounds like a real tinfoil hatter. I would love to see this guy defend himself in court, though I'm sure somebody else must be even nuttier.   Was this the inspiration for Professor Quirrel?   W124   I call Subaru and Toyota's shade of orange "county orange" because it reminds me of prison jumpsuits.   I agree. Whenever I see a beige or gold Mercedes or BMW I always cringe. Once I saw a beige Bentley and thought "why?". On the bright side, some golds from the 60s-70s aren't so bad looking.      CPO BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Lexus, Infiniti, or Cadillac.      Crown Vic   They've been playing too much GTA.   Yeah, but it's just interesting to see the flaws in their attempted realism.             I'm sure it isn't too common, though I have seen these types of cars a few times on eBay. I thought of asking because I recently watched the Jay Leno Toronado video.  Edit: and apparently I'm a prick for asking.   The first such car I can think of off the top of my head is Jay Leno's Olds Toronado, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuB5DULvw7Y.   In particular, how did you do it and what was the result. Most cars are built specifically with their layout in mind, so I would imagine that a RWD converted car that was FWD from the factory may be kind of awkward.            Apple products auto select Cupertino for weather updates, so maybe they just decided to give their otherwise obscure hometown a name in case the site becomes famous.   This does not sway me at all. 1.2 million fatalities a year out of a global population of 7 billion isn't so bad for our species. That means 1.2 million less people around to pollute and use resources. The decrease in deaths will also be bad for those of us who need organ transplants, since the supply will be decreased. Why don't we ban contact sports, motorcycles, and bicycles too. I personally believe that at best self driving cars will be cars with driver aids and at worst, a novelty item like flying cars, at least in our lifetimes.   What I mean by this is that it is common for billionaires such as the Koch brothers or Sheldon Adelson to influence politics by giving campaign contributions, gifts, etc. to politicians (arguably legalized bribery). Could such a person with tens of billions of dollars buy a large amount of stock in a highly regulated industry, such as alcohol, tobacco, or firearms and then pay politicians in order to make regulations more lax and decrease taxes, therefore making higher sales of these products easier. After doing this would they likely sell the stocks with a value that has gone up significantly and make a profit doing so?         /r/gtavcustoms/   ram raid   http://gta-myths.wikia.com/wiki/Big_Smoke%27s_Ghost   Maybe he meant 93'.      http://www.lefthandutes.com/   Would you consider converting it to RWD or AWD?

Tough Crowd   Looks like one of the cars I saw in one of my dreams.   There are about four US legal R34s.      1978 Chrysler New Yorker Brougham Coupe, because somebody else already said 79' Continental.      A few days ago I was thinking, what if I started a subreddit called /r/gtainreallife? But then I realized that it would probably become a haven for nutjobs who want to glorify robberies, dangerous driving, mass murder, and other violent crimes which would probably give GTA fans a bad name.         III era GTA logic.      I believe that the reason why GTA: O is not officially called "GTA V Online" is because when newer games come out like GTA 6, 7, etc. GTA Online will still be the same GTA Online, but with new additions. There will be a major update with each new single player title, which will add and replace some things in Online. This means that there will be new missions, characters, maps, cars, weapons, improved graphics etc., added on as a significant update when each new game is released.

          And a Labour MP wants special cycle lanes for women: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2710781/Women-need-special-cycle-lanes-pootle-away-scary-lycra-clad-men-says-ex-Labour-minister.html   No one photoshopped her hugely racist comments about Finnish nurses though, or about Caribbean mothers . The fact is she has a proven track record of racism going back years and the reason the racist posters are so believable is becasue she's the most racist person in Parliament.   Shame it gets spent mutilating African people's genitals for no good reason.      The problem with this strategy is that it can be interpreted as sexual, and there's an increasing amount of opposition in society to heterosexual men being open about sexual matters and a general tendency to demonise men and sex.  There is already a fairly strong pro foreskin movement within the gay community and that seems to work ok, and it would also work for women to express their desire and attraction for men with a natural penis. However, different rules apply to most men it can be slightly risky to celebrate the foreskin too much. Obviously it's nothing like the same as circumfetishists who gets their kicks out of mutilating kids, but clearly the best strategy is to attack such child abusers.  To be honest there's nothing to celebrate about having a foreksin becasue that's just normal isn't it and how things are meant to be? We don't celebrate having legs or arms do we?                  An alternative feminist school of thought is that all sex is rape, so those who prefer that theory at least don't regard celibate men as rapists.   I see the whoel thing has been debunked over at r/unitedkingdom. The lowest suicide rate of all was under Heath for example.    But given that national GDP changes were factored into the Australian study  Yes but is that simply GDP or GDP per capita? Under the Tories GDP has risen but only becasue they keep immigration at or near to Labour's previously huge levels, the average person is no better off. Furthermore, men are often left behind and on the scrap heap even during a recovery, so even though most people might be getting richer they could still be suffering in silence. For example labour decimated manufacturing in this country through mis-rule and closed down male industries such as mining. Thatcher continued with some of the closures and didn't' exactly help matters, but ultimately it was Labour who did a lot of the damage.  Ultimately, suicide is now mostly a male issue and all the Tories are pretty bad, it's still the case that the most anti-male agenda comes from Labour (and similar parties elsewhere in the world). We could cut suicide massively if we dealt with the awful family courts, actaully helped the 40% of domestic violence victims who are men, dealt with the sexist justice and prison system, introduced shared parenting and actually took men's health seriously.   Any chance of archive links to return of kings articles in future please?   I didn't read it in full, though one issue is that many suicides are a result of years of depression and long term factors such a failed relationships, unemployment. So for examples, someone would have lost their job and their house etc under the crash of the economy under Labour, though the associated depression wouldn't have resulted in their actual suicide until the coaltion were in power.  Also, I know for a fact that certain departments at the University of Bristol have some absolutely vile people with the most extreme views on issues and as a result I wouldn't trust half the research associated with that particular University (and I'd go so far as to assuming the exact opposite was true in many cases).   You might want to cross post something to r/unitedkingdom as there was a huge amount of interest in this story there.      That headline was automatically generated, nothing to do with me at all.            I was the very first person to email them about this (I started the thread on the topic too) and I received exactly the same type of aggressive response.  In other words, they're not flipping out after being contacted numerous times, this has been their exact attitude right from the very start.    several threatening emails and tweets  I've seen both tweets in question and also sent an email myself. The only "threatening" aspect is that they "threaten" to report the company if it doesn't comply with the law. They really are pathetic and childish, why not just reply politely/professioanlly and at least promise to investigate? And I've seen some pretty lame claims of a "cyber attack" before but this has top top the lot. Since when does a few people either lemaling, tweeting or posting a review constitute such a thing?                   Hi Jeremy, any chance of the BBC covering this popular story on hate speech by a Lib Dem executive committee member?:  https://hequal.wordpress.com/2015/04/01/kill-all-men-fk-men-die-cis-scum-says-lib-dem-executive-committe-member/ https://hequal.wordpress.com/2015/03/26/genocidal-hate-speech-by-lib-dems-at-the-national-union-of-students-womens-conference/  It has received a huge amount of attention here on Reddit with around 1,000 comments in total, yet no one from the MSM has picked up the story yet despite it clearly been worthy of coverage.   They did t least get the female part right though. Their MP is female as were their last 2 leaders and their voters also tend to be female. Explains their sexist prison policy I suppose?   Here's the original video, it currently has a 1.7% approval rating (8 thumbs up and 471 thumbs down):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THNUYnXQahc  The video was funded by the Tata corporation         Site says I have to be a subscriber to read the article so here's an alternative: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-07/call-to-dump-man-as-womens-officer-at-tasmanian-university-union/6374202   Insurance discrimination only became illegal a couple of years ago. Therefore all those focusing on giving discounts to women were in the clear until relatively recently.   Probably ok for individuals to seek a discount (perhaps they're all very light users for example?). Have you attempted to obtain a similar discount for yourself?   Their email address is: reception@peakfitnessgym.co.uk   No.   Comments in the thread also highlighted this case of blatant sexism too:  http://www.ballroomscotland.com/membership-male.html      The panel shows are feminist controlled now what with the mandatory female quota regardless of merit.   Unsurprisingly, the ignorant interviewer also has a second job working for the BBC. Is it any wonder they're so biased when this is the type of person they keep recruiting?   I think it's a fair statement to make as these things tend to be based on previous results. It probably won't be an appropriate description in a month's time though.   No, though I can see why you might ask and others have assumed the same thing. The tweets are still in place so you can check for yourself.   No sign of Jo Swinson condemning this, despite her remit being equalities      It's not one of my victories (though it is exactly the sort of thing I like to do).           It's actually really improving of late. The new Breitbart London team in particular seems to be especially good.                     So why has this been deleted? Reason given says "no local crime stories" yet that "rule" **doesn't even exist on the rules page**. This was almost the top story on r/worldnews at the time it was deleted and it's quite clearly a hugely significant event in terms of showing real progress in astarting to protect the millions of male rape victims worldwide.            Well one moment you had Sturgeon as Jim Bowen and then later Cameron had the same voice. If Sturgeon is going to be be Bowen then other people can't be him too.   Welsh one was perfect too (no idea what her name is). Didn't much like how you switched voices round though.   Listening to the insanity of Bennett is half the fun though, and she'd obviously be out first which is some ways would make it boring.  Really enjoyed the intro to Sturgeon btw.   Update - she's stepped down. Strange really, thought the Greens were big fans of female criminals such as her.  http://www.nottinghampost.com/Election-2015-Disgraced-landlord-Victoria/story-26277800-detail/story.html  The guy's death wasn't through violent means so, becasue she's a woman, the Greens wouldn't have even given her a suspended sentence!      Actually the video deletion message clearly gives "hate speech" as the reason for the removal. you can see proof of that here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_3887820991 feature=iv src_vid=_ChQom6yCuc v=rQ8ijScrUS8  Either someone at Youtube HQ  clicked the wrong button or this is 100% political censorship.         Seems there was a campaign against the video, full story about the censorship here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvqVxDO8z0Q  Note that they've also disabled a lot of features of the video owner's channel.                  Lib Dem is a legitimate term in the UK for political party the Liberal Democrats. It is completely neutral, uncontroversial and the party happily uses it themselves, even on their website addresses!  Also the correct name is "HEqual".      1. Do you support shared parenting? I note you didn't sign EDM 210 here: http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2013-14/210  2. What is you view of genital mutilation of male children? Do you think it is an appropriate use of scarce NHS funds to fund such abuses?   **Please name them!**   If it's hard to choose between two parties then try to examine the two candidates that are standing in your area and investigate which one has the most egalitarian values.  It's pretty easy to spot man hating feminists and their friends if you look into people's backgrounds. And if you've got a particularly nasty feminists in with a chance of winning then a vote for anyone standing against them counts as progress.      This might be of interest: http://empowering.hearst.co.uk/be-involved/jo-swinson-web-chat/      why not try messaging twitter accounts of the exec committees she sits on and also Lib Dem equality ministers?  Some examples: @LGBTLD @HSLibDems @julianhuppert (Lib Dem equalities spokesperson) @joswinson (Lib Dem and minister for equalities)      Lib Dem party code of conduct for reference: http://www.markpack.org.uk/71459/code-of-conduct-for-liberal-democrat-party-members/   Lib Dem party code of conduct: http://www.markpack.org.uk/71459/code-of-conduct-for-liberal-democrat-party-members/http://www.markpack.org.uk/71459/code-of-conduct-for-liberal-democrat-party-members/   Well the Liberal democrats didn't tend to be into this sort of thing quite as much as the Labour Party or Greens, so it is a little surprising.   Probably the least significant of the four positions. The Yorkshire branch position and the LGBT one seem to be the most significant.   The "all" was in reference to killing men, not fucking them.   This isn't an April fools prank BTW. The tweets are all genuine.   Wonder if she's added herself to the block list? There are clearly numerous violations there which would merit a level 1 block.   This is real btw. Not an April fools article unfortunately.   She actually sits on three lib den exec committees and a further policy committee for liberal youth. Taken together that makes her pretty significant.            This guy isn't one of us. That said, there's absolutely no reason why youtube should censor that video.         Please remember to donate to the J4M B election campaign. The deadline for donations to fund the leaflets is 6th April:   https://j4mb.wordpress.com/2015/03/22/11904/  It's excellent value for money becasue under UK electoral law the Royal Mail is obliged to deliver every single leaflet for free!   In the long run it forces at least one of the two to take men's human rights seriously.   Your misunderstand the strategy. You target seats where the election is on a knife-edge and where you can ruin things for whoever is currently in power there.  It sends a strong message that people can either support equality for men or they can face extra opponents who will take votes away from them and possibly cost them their seat.   This J4M B fund-raiser represents great value for money activism so please get involved if you can.  The way UK electoral system works is that each party gets one leaflet delivered free of charge by the Royal Mail wherever they are standing. Therefore donors only need fund the printing cost and then the leaflet gets delivered **free of charge.**  Given that the cost of postage on the UK equates to about 53 pence (80 cents), **you're basically getting $9 worth of services for every dollar you give!**  I'd challenge anyone to find a better value way of donating to men's human rights causes right now.  Donation are accepted from abroad as long as they are less than 5,000  Here's an article with further info:  https://j4mb.wordpress.com/2015/03/22/11904/     This J4M B fund-raiser represents great value for money activism so please get involved if you can.  The way UK electoral system works is that **each party gets one leaflet delivered free of charge by the Royal mail wherever they are standing.** Therefore donors only need fund the printing cost and then the leaflet gets delivered free of charge.  Given that the cost of postage on the UK equates to about 53 pence (80 cents), you're basically getting $9 worth of services for every dollar you give!  I realise that quite a few fund-rasiers by various organisations have been listed recently, but I'd challenge anyone to find a better value way of donating to men's human rights causes right now.   Yes, J4M B has had one hell of an impact. Might not work so well in a two party country such as the USA, but on the other hand it would be perfect in a system that used proportional representaiton.    remake Harry Potter but as a girl!  Seems rather narrow minded of you, why can't he be a Japanese fire engine?     Castle seemed mostly very good from what I've read about her though I wasn't around at the time to know for sure so maybe there's a negative side I've not read about  Mo Mowlam seemed better than most, and Dunwoody was also light years ahead of anything Labour have right now.   Yes, with about 10 minutes leadership between the two of them. And one is Harman and so if a woman as vile and hated as her is the best Labour have got then that says it all.  I'm not saying Labour has to install a female leader or has even had that many suitable candidates, just that it would be preferable and make much more sense to see a female Labour leader sometime rather than a female James Bond (though preferably one of those who got into power due to merit rather than via a sexist  all women shorlist).   Still waiting to see a female Labour leader, or even a competent female Labour politician be given a major role in the party. All the best labour women I can think of are no longer with us and instead the two who were promoted to the most important roles in recent years have been Harriet Harman and Jacqui Smith!   Can't find any evidence of a campaign on Twitter. Perhaps it was internal pressure by the various extremist feminists already employed by IBTimes?   I can only guess that thee was a feminist campaign against the column. His articles were brilliant and very popular, particularly the most recent one.      Did that over a year ago. Contacted the entire board, CEO etc. they changed the classifications for about 4% of the sites we highlighted and explicitly confirmed that tgey stood by the hate classification for each and every single one of the others.   Actually his would be pretty damn good if it included gender.  It gives excelletnt results if we include this or assume gender to be a culture.   1. No. I cannot mostly be with other males at college/university as higher education classes are now female dominated across the western world.  2. No. Young women earn more than young men and many adverts for renting accommodation explicitly ban males, thus making it hard to access housing.  3. No. As a male, I'm far more likely to face violence than females, someone of this is likely to be by those living in my street.  4. Yes, though there are attempts by some to reduce the protein I need to consume to remain healthy.  5. No. men are demonised in the media, regularly stereotyped either as idiots, incapable parents, or as violent and abusive.  6. No. All the world's problems tend to be blamed on men, usually white men.  7. Strange question.  8. Yes, but the gaming industry is already under attack and music seems to be the next target so probably not safe for much longer.  9. This doesn't' happen to any group that I'm aware of, though in some places men are often punished becasue of their gender when buying car insurance  10. I don't have any "borthers", but whatever they are I'm sure that as a male  I'm burdened with protecting them and putting myself in harms way to do so.  11. If I use curse words it will probably be considered abusive or threatening behaviour becasue of my gender.  12. The justice system is known to discriminate against all males on a mass scale and to a huge extent. Any discrimination against ethnic minorities by the justice system is completely dwarfed by the scale of discrimination on the ground of gender. Were I a female doing so I'd simply be considered "empowered".  13. Happens to both men and women, though actually probably more so women.  14. Happens all the time. "Teach men not to rape" even a state sponsored "men can stop rape" campaign. Why am I supposed to stop men and women raping each other simply becasue of my gender?  15. Depends. Certainty not in many schools, nor in a lot of taxpayer funded institutions.  16. One domestic violence shelter for men in the whole of Canada despite half of victim being men, and will probably be arrested instead of the perpetrator if I call the police as a victim of domestic violence. Widespread discrimination in medical research against males (e.g. cancer). And if I'm on a sinking ship I'll be the last to be rescued!            These scams have been popped up all over the place, I know of at least one example in the UK.      An anonymous coward.      Good job using an archive link. Wonder what his opinion is on having fathers in prisons?  Very encouraging to see that all the top rated comments call the author out on his blatant sexism and stupidity.            I meant the motive behind them is 100% political, obviously they have to have more than a few genuinely offensive users on there in order to appear legitimate.  It's a men's rights issue becasue we're the ones constantly beign censored and defamed. We're the targets of these blocking campaigns, ahead of almost anyone else. Read up the the Symantec Rulespace scandal for a much more serious example of this (disclaimer - I've written more about that case than any other author so the chances are that you'll be reading my work or something based upon it).    The person who blocked wasn't going to listen to what the person they blocked had to say anyway, for whatever reason.  Well I agree your point apples to a lot of feminists and a lot of users of the block bots, but some people will be duped into using these block lists thinking they are genuine tools to block offensive users when they're actually 100% political.  Hearing well-argued and logical dissenting views really is a useful thing and of course there's the Twitter block function for dealing with very isolated incidents of harassment and blatant trolls.   True, though surely any sane person would want to use a bot that operates as described, and actually blocks sexism and hate, and these bots just don't do that.  They certainly claim be about helping people avoid some of the nastier accounts on Twitter, yet in reality many of those on the list are simply there becasue they dared to disagree or even question a particular aspect of extremist feminism.  The bots aren't about making the twitter experience any more pleasant or safer for Twitter users, they're simply political tools used to silence dissent and simply make Twitter into an echo chamber for those using them.         message me your twitter username or post it on here if that's allowed and we'll make that at least 31      I expect a fair few posters to r/mensrights are blocked by one of these bots. You can check here:  http://blockcheck.leagueforgamers.com/  Perhaps people can post below and state what block level they're subject to? The level 1 block is the most severe.   Congratulations, a pretty good endorsement on of your tweets.   Seems to be the other bot that is the really stupid one though.         yes but would the same newspaper have allowed such a piece directed at females or certain  ethnic minorities?   Very useful tool. The level 1 rank is the highest, meaning the feminists hate you more than those with a level 2 or 3 rank.                  At the very least, if they really must publish hate speech then they need to name the author.  Pretty cowardly of them not to give their name, and it's also despicable for the newspaper to grant anonymity to a writer for no other reason that the fact that their comments are hateful and possibly illegal. At the very least they would surely end up being fired by their employer or kicked out of whatever university they attend.      A quick question about blockbot, is there a list somewhere of great accounts that have level 1 blocks? If so, is there any sort of campaign for everyone to all follow these accounts therefore causing the whole blockbot thing to backfire?  I can't be the first person to think of such an idea, and apologies if it seems like a dumb question.   Found this to be an interesting article. i discovered that the HEqual_UK account is subject to a level 1 block.  I wonder if we could all counter this by actually finding people subject to blocks and all following them thus making the entire scheme backfire? I'm a little late to the party with regard to the block-bot story so perhaps there's already something like this in place that I'm unaware of?      It's obvious that the Clinton article is a complete joke. For one thing, even the page title is wrong - there are no other famous Hilary Clintons to confuse readers so Wikipedia rules make it quite clear the article should be titled "Hilary Clinton" and the name "Rodham" should be omitted.  No doubt it's the Wikipedia feminists who won't allow the correct name to be used and it looks like there have been multiple attempts by neutral editors to actually title the article correctly.    It's obvious that the Clinton article is a complete joke. For one thing, **even the page title is wrong** - there are no other famous Hilary Clintons to confuse readers so Wikipedia rules make it quite clear the article should be titled "Hilary Clinton" and the name "Rodham" should be omitted.  No doubt it's the Wikipedia feminists who won't allow the correct name to be used and it looks like there have been multiple attempts by neutral editors to actually title the article correctly.      100% true but the Liberal Democrats are far more moderate than the NUS and actually have had soe good policies over the years. Hate speech is to be expected at the NUS, but not by senior Liberal Democrat figures (it does happen, but they eventually tend to get in trouble for it if you complain)   Also noteworthy that she sits on 3 executive committees of a political party currently in power in the UK.   it will be interesting to see how the lib deme handle this. Surely will put already angry supports off them and could be the last straw for quite a few.      Not a good week for gender equality within the Lib Dems.      Imagine the media outrage had they been in UKIP instead - one for you guys to add to the list I guess.      This is as much about the Lib Dems as it is about feminism (if not more so).  There were clearly countless man hating feminists in attendance at NUS Women 2015 (probably more than almost anywhere else in the country). These misandrist feminists will always exist and I guess they're entitled to get together and do whatever they want. However, if people want to get involved with such extremism and actually express such vile views about half the population then there should be no place for them in the Lib Dems and they certainly should have roles on no less than 3 Lib Dem exec committees.  Ultimately, if Lib Dem exec members go out of their way to spread hatred against half the electorate than how do they ever expect to win any seats? They might pick up the self-loathing male vote, though tbh Labour and the Greens already pretty much have that tiny section of the electorate to themselves already.   And meanwhile the Lib Dems have someone on no less than 3 of their executive committees who thinks we "need to remove men from society":  https://hequal.wordpress.com/2015/03/26/genocidal-hate-speech-by-lib-dems-at-the-national-union-of-students-womens-conference/      The author wouldn't even put there name to that piece of hate speech. It's net resting that the newspaper allows sexist and racist rants to be submitted anonymously.      I'm not saying these articles are the best material for this subreddit, but it is possible to see their relevance. perhaps we need a false rape subreddit to archive all this material instead?   Take your shitty links somewhere else. We don't want that crap here.   Firstly, the sentence is too short, especially as she'll almost certainly be released half way through it. Secondly, these articles will continue to be relevant for as long as feminist claim that these cases don't really happen.         I've actually read her other Tweets. Some of her ideas are pretty decent (e.g. on prostitution), others tweet tend to be a bit crazy or simply sexist.  Anyway, still waiting to see something objectionable about the site. Others have already replied to the tweet noting that it looks like she's promoting genocide and she hasn't denied that's what she wants.   Shame you don't' have the power to censor it like you did in the r/libdem subreddit isn't it?  People aren't going to vote Lib Dem with bigots like that in exec positions in the party, so covering for them is only going to casue harm in the long run.   Well how else does she propose on meeting this "need" to remove men from society other than using genocide. I can't really think of any other possible methods. Perhaps aborting male foetuses is nan alternative, though that's probably genocide too really.  And I'm not spreading any harassment campaign - she's the one promoting removing men form society and putting men in the bin. Her actions are clearly newsworthy and if she didn't' want to be in the headlines then she should keep spreading hatred on Twitter while occupying multiple executive positions in a major political party.   Hateful bigots always pretend it was all a big joke when their conduct is exposed, it's a standard defence. Furthermore, I've already uncovered a further misandrist Tweet posted on the same day by the same individual. She isn't fit to be on any Lib Dem committee, and most certainly not ones aimed at opposing discrimination.  And without wanting to defend any abuse received, if you punch someone in the face then you can expect to get punched back. Hatred simply breeds more hatred.   Find one single hateful, sexist or unsavoury sentence on the site. It's pro-gender equality.  If you can't find such a sentence then you need to show you're genuinely Liberal and restore this post. Lib Dems here are clearly concerned about someone on exec committees behaving in such a hateful way, and we were having a good and open discussion on the issue until you censored it.   Well I'm fine with putting things into context, it actually makes her look even worse. Here's another Tweet she posted on the same day:  "I keep putting men in the bin and they keep crawling out." #nuswomen15  https://twitter.com/sarahlicity/status/580390741798699008  Anyway, this is really spreading rapidly on Twitter now no matter how much the mods here try to bury the story.   They want equality for fathers, and although that puts them ahead of all the other main parties I'm not aware of any other good pro-equality policies they have yet.  They certainly seem to be very pro-equality, but it would be nice if they were more vocal about it.         Is there a code of conduct she will have breached? As a member perhaps you'd be in a strong position to make a complaint?      She's on the lib dem LGBT executive committee, hardly just a standard member. Also I note you just posted some lib dem surveys, do you have a connection to the party your not telling us about?   Here's another of her tweets from the conference: @sarahlicity: "I keep putting men in the bin and they keep crawling out." #nuswomen15   That sentence is nothing like what she said. Your replies are getting worse.   Others on Twitter view it as hate speech too and came to that. Conckudion independent of me. I don't see any of your explanations above remotely compelling  other than the standard excuse that it was all a big "joke". We're extremely blind go hate speech when it's directed at men and it's natural for this to happen in your case too. To overcome this bias try substituting the term "men" for a different group and then see how it reads. For example "we need to remove Jews from society"   How else would you satisfy this "need" to "remove men from society" then? Maybe she means to put them all in a prison camp or is it a more gradual thing where we just terminate all pregnancies when the foetus is identified as male?   Yet more sexism against men by female Lib Dems. Hardly going to do very well in May if they keep on showing such contempt for 49% of the electorate.   Submitted this earlier with a crap title, apologies for that.         For those without the time to read the article, unsurprisingly she said this while at the now notorious  NUSWmen201 event.      Seems more like a sticking plaster to me. Why can't we just actually tackle all the discrimination against men instead, or at least all the discrimination against them practiced by the state.   In all fairness, I'd guess that many of the most talented males who want to go into teaching are so intelligent/sensible and well informed that they realise it would be a bad move. Therefore the quality of male candidates is probably slightly lower than it should be, owing to the obvious misandry that exists in the profession stopping people from even applying or training.   The violence and fire alarm pulling in Toronto involved large numbers of people, many feminists were involved and they even recruited trade union officials to support what they did. The criminal acts and obscene harassment happened repeatedly at least 4 separate men's issues evens over the space of more than a year. You can watch video of every single incident on Youtube  For the details on feminists supporting female paedophiles read about what happened too Michelle Elliot, who pioneered research into this area (she founded Kidscape too). There's a video interview of Michelle on youtube which is essential viewing, though the main channel has been taken down so I'd need to find you a mirror. edit- i found it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzC6OfPj82I  Your point about men getting custody when they "ask" for it is meaningless. Most know they have zero chance and thus are advised not to even bother trying in court and wasting huge sums of moeny. Rich men get custody and those where the mother is clearly unfit - that's about it.  Here's a source for a feminist organisation doubting that fasle rape allegations even exist: http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2010/02/does-the-moon-really-exist.html  Your final point sis wrong in the US, particularly colleges, who have now officially switched to a preponderance of evidence weighting for rape allegations thanks to feminists: http://www.stanforddaily.com/2012/05/21/op-ed-against-the-preponderance-of-evidence-standard/   Just try to say open a men's centre at a Univeristy (whre men are a significant minority) and feminists will oppose it  ruthlessly.  Try to organise a talk on male suicide by Warren Farrell and feminists will blockade the event, use violence and scream abuse at attendees and pull fire alarms risking everyone's safety.  Try to organise a conference on female paedophiles (who typically abuse boys) and feminists will protest it.  Try to point out that 40% of dv victims are men and they need shelters, feminists will lie and agree and oppose funding for such facilities.  Feminist organisations openly campaign against shared parenting, and campaign for women to have custody of children. They deny that false rape accusations even exist (thus meaning all the male victims of false rape allegations who comitt suicide therefore don't really exist). They hijacked the domestic violence shelters in this country for political purposes and forced the pro-equality founder out of her own organisation becasue she dared to not that a lot of the women in the shelters were also pretty violent and abusive themselves and therefore dv wasn't a gender issue.  Feminists are even attakcing men in the justice system, removing even the most fundamental of rights such as the concept of innocece before proven guilty.  I'm not saying their aren't other obstacles to equality for males, and the more conservative/macho attitude of some doesn't' help. However, it's feminists that are now by far the strongest, most vocal, most committed and most successful opponents of the human rights of men.    Is that a recent thing? I remember when my brother was at primary school they only had one or two male teachers in the entire school and they were adored by the parents  Being adored by parenting doesn't really help you keep your job much. The hostility to male teachers comes from other teachers, management and generally hostility to men overall as a group.    takes some real issues that men (and everyone) should be talking about and turns them into a club to beat women and feminists with  The former of thsoe two things would be terrible but the latter entirely justified for 90% of men's issues given that feminists are the main opponents of men's human rights most of the time. I think people often confuse attacking extreme feminism with attacking women, when in reality they couldn't be much more different.  	199
 Gargoyle bike is tight    I've been caught breaking the law (minor stuff like weed in public) three times now and every single time the cops let me off with a friendly warning. Always polite, never intimidating. I love Alberta cops.    /r/marijuanaenthusiasts   I recently read how as far back as Ancient Greece, philosophers have had theories about how reality as we know it could be an illusion, sort of like in The Matrix. How far back does this concept go and what caused humans to initially become skeptical of the world around us without any proof?    Cable management needs work     goddamn that's exactly what I thought it was gonna be lol    Yooo I want one    Indeed, for me cyberpunk is more of an aesthetic than it is about the actual advances in technology! Until we get into cyborg territory that is. That shit is quintessentially cyberpunk.    A short by Dylan J Nathan.         All great :)    I fucking love my boosts! Enjoy mate    Havel's Helmet Silver Knight Armour Shadow Gauntlets Shadow Leggings  Black Knight Sword Black Iron Great Shield       na dude particle board is super weak it was like an IKEA desk.   ah that sounds little too exploit-y, I just want some extra time to heal goddamn     was it no bonfire?    never the actual controller, but I had a particle board desk at one time until I "accidentally" put a few holes in it with the butt end of an xbox controller.    yeah I fail at parrying and I'm stuck on him right now in NG+++  What's this pillar trick? :P    As a heavy tank build I think Four Kings is probably the easiest boss in the game for me. If you get right up on them their hits only takes out like 1/15th of my health every time   I'm stuck on Gwyn right now on NG+++ and for some reason I just can't fucking get parrying down so it comes down to luck and rolling away in time to spam estus after staggering him..    I finally picked up Dark Souls a few months ago and fell in love with it after hearing my coworkers rave about it forever. I'm now on NG+++ and about 150~ hours in. Haven't even gotten to trying multiplayer yet (on Xbox and don't feel like paying for live)  By contrast I picked up Dark Souls 2 SoFS after finishing my first playthrough of 1, played about 10 hours into it and quit. None of the things I loved about Dark Souls made it over to the new iteration. Working at a game store, I have met people who really love DS2 just as much if not more than the original, but I find the overwhelming majority of people say Dark Souls was definitely a more impactful game.    Age of Empires and the school library! I was a nerdy little child.     name it Zweihander    lol k liam neeson settle down    what a time to be alive    GT was terrible anyway. Yaay new cannon DBZ!    But what does it mean?    Hopefully she never ever hears about the club Berghain    I thought it was gonna be a Matt Damon/ Capra Demon mashup. Awesome work though!    Sibyl is located in 101    Finally getting to Bigtits room and acquiring the Lordvessel is by far one of best feelings in the game.    Yeah it's waay harder to kill Smough first! Every time after my first play-through  i've attempted to kill him first because I want Ornsteins set (NG+++ now) but every time I end up giving up and killing Ornstein first because I just want the damn lord vessel already.   Alright so I'm mostly a house and techno guy but come on who the fuck doesn't like hip hop?  Anyways i've been wanting to round out my rap collection as of late and my question to this sub is what are some of the must-knows of the digital rap world? What are the best places to keep up on both news and releases?   I love to digitally crate dig and find new music; I know iTunes is usually the go-to place to actually buy the music but sometimes I prefer the more curated sites, ones usually run by the real heads in the scene. Any advice would be much appreciated.    omg I love this sub    What he said ^    Tough choice, both nice boards. I also kind of want a wasd with a little less loud switches haha.   ^ me on an alt    lol ya forgot to crop it out    No I don't think so, Gold serpent ring would help though. Sometimes I play a game where I take a hit every time I die... almost passed out trying to beat S O       lol I still use BKS+5 as my daily driver 3 playthroughs in. I'm a str build tho so it scales well, out-damages all of the boss soul weapons save for Artorias great sword I think, which i'll never have enough int to use anyway :(  Ps love the username haha, Dank souls is the shit    "Neither campus authorities nor police believed her. Combined with the fact that she is broadcasting her rape to the media, granting interviews to anyone who will ask (heres a video interview with Time), and using it to get an easy A grade on her thesis, its safe to conclude that we are looking at a false rape accusation by a mentally unstable woman. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this girl was not truly raped, and instead was sour about being pumped and dumped after giving up her anus to a guy she had the tingles for."   LPT: If you're going to comment on a story at least read it first.    I hope that mattress causes her to lose her balance on a very tall staircase...    lol yeah I killed them in my first play through but now I always just nope past em to the shortcut    hell even the regular hollows are dangerous with their berserk move. And don't get me started on the skeleton hounds in NG++... fucking 1 shots even with tank build and fully upgraded giant armour    lol    I agree he's probably one of the easiest high level boss fights, next to pinwheel..    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoDaBmi06S4   Gameplay wise, Four Kings because you just have to go all in and it's a rush falling into the abyss for the first time not knowing wtf is going on. But Nito is definitely my fave. So badass plus finally getting to warp out of the Tomb of the Giants after finishing him is a great feeling.    media =/= real life    TIL there are elitist South Park fans. Insecure people can be pretentious about anything I guess..    I think you take yourself a bit too seriously m8    Half the episodes are based on current events and pop culture. The quality is and forever has been hit or miss. Some episodes are brilliant others are just filler. I'm just saying as long as they keep poking fun at current events the show can never become irrelevant.     I feel pretty much the opposite way.. like it can never really get stale unless society stops doing dumb shit that can be made fun of. Which will be never.    What if I told you it doesn't matter in the slightest. Like literally not at all.    nice, for a second I thought I was in /r/synthesizers    I totally needed this at 4 am....not. haha  but seriously that's some fucked up food for thought.     As far as I could tell the robot was actually designed to intentionally purchase illicit items from the deep web as part of an art project/experiment. All the items, including ecstasy, a fake passport and a ballcap with a hidden pov camera were confiscated at the end of the project, in accordance with the plan.    Check out some fashion designs by companies like Aitor Throup, Musee Noir, Rick Owens. They're expensive as fuck but should serve as good inspiration.

Some of the newer monitors have it    I never noticed it before but :9 looks like a weird smiley with it's tongue out. Also nice monitor! Is it one of those ones you can partition?   	64
 I have no idea.... My fidelity warranty better cover it thats all i care lol.   If you dont work for the CIA yet then you should!    Mine was on a tow truck today too.  And lol there was another a4 being towed too.  In case you're curious. My car was being towed in because of engine oil pressure issue.   Reason being that if you look at your manual it advises that you warm up your car by driving under 2 rpms rather than waiting 5 minutes on idle and wasting gas.    What are your recipes for a paleo diet, desi style?   They dont think... They just do it. Like their license plate.   And if russia does it then its the End of days. (which is true imho)   Go get them u silly goose! Commenting here isnt going to do anything.   It was mutual in the beginning because I wanted to move onto the next stage of my life.   I graduated with a Masters in SE in 2010. So i figured a year or two later I'd go to india and start the search. But apparently going to India and finding a wife at age 24 is too young. While my college friends had already went and gotten married. So i figured id wait till girls in India were ready.   Now that im 27 its probably the right time but now I just feel like theres a huge barrier. Because im having a very hard time connecting with girls lol. I've kind of lost my self esteem and confidence because I have no control over this process. My parents were just very adamant on getting me hitched with this one girl because her family was good. But i just wasnt attracted to her so I just pushed it off cause there wasnt any other choices. And any other choices that did come up then my parents would just find reasons for why I shouldnt marry her. So it was a pain.  Few months ago I showed them someone that I was interested in and they were very pissed off and started emotionally black mailing me so I just said heck with it and told them to start the search again. So right now im in a limbo state of what I want to do. There are girls in India but I have a very hard time connecting with them. I cant match up with their standards and they cant match up with mine. I wouldnt mind dropping my standard if the girl was someone I knew, could relate to, etc but its very hard when u have to go based on a biodata and then have the uncles in india do a background search and then finally, maybe... get to talk to her. Though usually its their parents u talk to first. Lol its just a complete mess of a system. Growing up in an indian community and having lived in india for 7 yrs i thought i would be able to understand, relate and work with the system. But honestly its just a horrible system. Its really a quasi marketplace where you're bartering each other. Lol. Maybe this is a approach that keeps the family stable in the long run. But im not sure if it keeps the family happy in the long run.  Plus lol i sent an email to one of the fathers and he replied back with "how long r u in us? Whats ur salary?" I didnt mind most of the questions but how can you so easily ask for someones salary. I havent even talked to ur daughter and know if she and I will get along. Lol its just ridiculous.   Plus, most girls in India dont really want to go to US. The economy there is in a better condition than it was before so they feel as if they have no reason to come here.      So I'm in somewhat of a pickle that only desis would relate with.  I am currently working at job where I dont have a real future because we got acquired last year and our business goals are different than when I started with them.   Now on my table I have an offer for almost the same salary at a defense contractor for something that I really want to work on. Asp.net (for anyone curious). I will lose 10 vacation days and stuff but that's one issue.   The one issue that is troubling for me and I'm sure my parents is that I was supposed to go to India in November to go look for a significant other and get engaged. My current company offers me to take a month off since i have 25 days. So not sure what to do...  I dont really want to go to India in November because I think it will be a waste of money and I wont find anyone but also would like to just find someone and get on with it.     Getting irritated by the whole wifey search in India.   Hopefully you get most of it back in cash.   Dude, you nailed it!! Esp the part about the aborted girls!   Im 27, unmarried, havent dated for over 8 yrs just so I could focus on college. But now that I have to find a wifey I have no idea how to relate to them, talk to them, etc. etc. it sucks!  Plus the demands of indian girls and their parents and myself and my parents is making it almost impossible to find a suitable match. Plus its so hard to connect to someone solely on their bio-data. Lol i hate this process but what can we do......    Or side   Its because of Midtown Madness that I knew Chicago very well! Lol went to it the first time and I was like hmm this is where that stadium is, the highway, etc   Google Chrome   Chloroform!    The Nativity. Every Christmas.   They probably do it because of those darn squiggly lines.   Or a /r/lifehack   Those expert picks dont count in the spread. They predict which team will win. I realize that this question asked about a pick'em game without spread but for games that have a spread what would be your strategy?   What do the values in each column mean and how do you use those values to pick the proper team. Especially against a spread (if possible).   I have been doing pick'em for the past four years. No strategy at all. The problem is that we have spread so that makes it very hard.  But without it I would just go with what one of the user mentioned. Expert Picks or even user picks.   How do you count in the spread?   Is there a guide on how to read that and make sense of it?    Fear - lecrae   Yes, I did ask them and they are helping me. They provided a small exercise ball to use for getting the form right. It does help but still doesnt seem to make a perfect move so thats why I was wondering what kind of tips people here had.   I think that might be one of my major issues is flexibility. I think I might have an anterior pelvic tilt so that might be one reason.   So you're saying shes black?    I suck at rolls. Cant seem to get myself around all the way.  Its embarrasing. I cant seem to get the momentum to rotate.   Loved it! Just out of even my imaginary budget!   thanks!   Or when Troy in "the community" is sad that he isnt molested.   How do you have 200k already? Lol   Dont just go to college for a degree you like but one that has actual job oppotunities.  Do your homework in college! And get internships.  Enjoy your life. From high school to about 25 are the best years because health wise you're mostly safe and sound and can easily socialize with people of the same age and common hobbies.   Make better relations with people of the opposite sex! Even if they dont turn out to be your SO they will help you in talking and interacting with your SO down the road.   Same way Davids Army loved the Philistines. Oh wait....   Op, can you explain in detail how you did it. I'd like to get into christian meditation.   For those of you with a CS undergrad/grad degree, what did you do with an MBA?  Did you utilize it? Did you switch into management or continue to be a programmer?  I'm 27 years old and already have a MS in SE. Now I'm wondering if I want to get an MBA or switch jobs. Company is paying 5k per year for whatever school you go to.   Do not be yoked with an unbeliever.      NLT. Easiest to read and relevant.   Aol has done this for a while   Sports, premium channel shows, movies, etc. its a great way to get the content that most people flock to cable for without a crazy price. Plus it helps me bring down my cost of cable.    These are subaccounts. Theyre intended for kids so that everyone has an individual account for watching what they want. So no access to billing, etc.   Yes, pretty much. Fios also has a mobile app that you can use to watch live programming. And they also have a similar on demand thing online.   Having a slingbox so that you can watch your cable service at another place is not illegal. If it was then they couldnt legally sell slingbox.  Is it illegal if you live in the same town and can subscribe to the same service. I doubt illegal because noone is going to come after you. Maybe unethical. That said, you're still paying the cable company for their service. So they're better of with you doing this then not. So if I were you I wouldn't think about it too much.  -- a guy who sells slingbox services  	45
       Latin American countries are culturally similar to the U.S.? Have you visited either place...?  Also, you've completely forgotten how many asian immigrants we take in on the West Coast.  Stop making uneducated excuses for your ill-informed xenophobia.   Why do you hate me, /u/PrettyIceCube?                               I'm very much surprised there hasn't been a shoutout to /r/forearmporn   Well, there've also been actual cuts to higher ed. In my state, the portion of tuition that was covered by the state has flipped from 66% to 33% in a few years. Meanwhile, we have more students and therefore a need for more bureaucracy.  We can settle for less and argue all we want about who gets the scraps, but the fact is we *need* to raise state funding generally. Both admin and faculty need to get paid, not one or the other.   I'm reading "The First World War and the International Power System" by Paul Kennedy, and he uses several tables and a short paragraph to summarize some of the basic causes of Italy's shitty performance during WWI; its industrial incapability, it's lack of economic power, etc. I'm wondering why Italy was so industrially incompetent and economically weak in the first place, despite having the historical power of the Vatican and having famous traders and explorers, and having such strong allies? Also why it militarily did not perform very well, but that's probably related to the answer to the question above.   Wouldn't it be UPS? Brown shirt and all...         I'll just bet it has something to do with those meddling British and their dumb Navy, but I really have to clue!                                 I don't understand why this reply from an expert is not being upvoted more than Dr. Amateur up there.                                       And marvel underwear!! Wonder who's on them ;)   What if I told you...it doesn't matter?   *Another* Jobs biopic? Ugh...  But yes to Michael.   Reddit is: totally avoiding the point for the sake of feeling important by correcting technicalities.   The basic premise that you're communicating is something I agree with, but you could maybe not be an asshole about it.   You just ran a half marathon on a whim??   Well I mean yeah, but certainly the cunts over at /r/worldnews can be a bit cuntier than most, let's not throw ourselves all in their boat.  Edit: although I did use the word "cunt" twice in that sentence, so...maybe I do kind of suck.   So did you enjoy it? I haven't read it yet.   HEY EVERYBODY!! THIS GUY'S GIVING OUT FREE KARMA FOR ZOOLANDER REFERENCES!!   Eh, from time to time Disney does some fucked up shit.  	53
 For me, it's just freedom. It's those late nights coming home from hanging out with your friends and being the only one on the road. Windows down, music softly playing with the low rumble of the exhaust, it's just the most surreal experience ever.   The reason I went with it is because my 944 isn't my daily driver. It's just my autocross car.   Definitely, I think the reason why Hagerty is so much lower than normal carriers is because of the restrictions that put on. Meaning it needs to be stored in a garage, can't be driven more than 5,000 miles a year, and you need to have at least 25 to drive alone.    It really depends on which insurance carrier you have. There was a thread a couple weeks ago here about insurance for junior operators. I pay $100 a year on mine and I'm 18, but that's because its on Hagerty. The downfall with Hagerty is that if you're under 25, you're not allowed to drive alone.   http://www.forzamotorsport.net/Handlers/GetPhoto.ashx?game=fh2 id=1765060 full=true   I do it's in my computer, I'll upload it tonight when I get home from work    Close enough haha, they are probably my favorite style rim    Love the Watanabes, works great with the color.   I CAN BREAK THESE CUFFS!   Volvo wagons, and Subaru    Yeah that's what I said, until I walked back into school.   I'm really sorry for you loss, I can tell you that your father was a great man.   I absolutely love the Maxima, it looks soooooo clean    Awwww yes, us Northeastern guys don't get much attention at all in any racing games.   Fujimi, Tskuba, and for new tracks I really want Lime Rock.   M'Jeep   Not to mention, that's an eBay no name brand steering wheel. That alone would put me off knowing that the owner was willing to sacrifice safety for the "JDM" factor. Even if it's a small thing like a steering wheel, what else did the owner skimp out on?   The only somewhat interesting car at my schools parking lot is a Honda Fit that's completely riced out   Ooohhhhh my god yes, the shifters in it are amazing.   Can't forget about the McLaren F1   Not shitty  Edit: just noticed the gold tooth, that's pretty shitty   Is this the same Galpin that was on pimp my ride?   Sounds like you got an awesome project on your hands.   Nice! What other mods do you have planned if there are any others?   I like it. A lot. It reminds of the VIP cars, but yet it's still subtle that it looks completely natural.    Yup, Upgarage! It turns out, you can actually have them ship overseas too. What I did was sent all of the parts I wanted to their headquarters, and that's where my dad is going. I just figured since my dad was going there for the week I'd save hundreds on shipping :D   I'm sourcing a set of Watanabes, and I'm getting a Momo steering wheel, parts in Japan are soooooo cheap   I think it's in the box.    1996 Porsche 993tt   This is what my dad's currently doing for me right now while he's in Japan. I think it you put it in a cardboard box, you can label it as luggage and bring it home on the plane. Edit: I forgot, I think the total price has to be under $400.   The race never started because it never worked!   Going by your name I assume you have a 951 track car. Got any pics?  	32
 Excellent comment, the keyword is FEELING.  Boredom is just that an emotion just like happiness, anger, frustration, resentment, joy, desire, and cravings.  We get stronger each time we see the emotion and doggedly persist in our daily commitment to ourselves not to drink TODAY, only.   Welcome /u/standardcapacityman to r/stopdrinking.  I don't know what sort of device you're working off of so I don't know if you can see the sidebar, but there is a link to the 2014 survey which you might find enlightening.  Most of us report in the polling data that we were able to stop drinking with little or no discomfort.  Obviously to some extent or another we are all different and our use was different, but I'm suggesting that most of us get through the rapids pretty easily. At this [link is a post called the Baby Steps that lays](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  There might be some "next steps" for you too.  good luck.   When I came back after a 7 year relapse (I had been sober in a previous life for 15 continuous years) the same old things worked to stop drinking that had worked before.  Simple sober actions: [the Baby Steps were not beneath me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  I still do them today.   The reason I don't drink TODAY is because I stayed sober long enough to begin to see and value my alcohol-free life.  Life  on life's terms.     Welcome back.   Yeah, the confederate flag ain't 'bout no racism.         Welcome /u/kittyhugtime to /r/stopdrinking -- at this [link you will find a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which describes exactly what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  Most of us come into recovery with some real painful memories and consequences.  At your young age you are poised to turn it around early and live a happy and full life.  Good luck.   Here's what works for me when I'm feeling "off" or that maybe I'm not as strong as was--I cling to the notion that I've felt this way in the past and it was usually a prelude to a breakthrough or some real insight that if I had not doggedly persisted I would never have arrived at.  I also cling to the hope and belief that my sharing even when I'm down--helps others when they are down and hanging on by what feels like fingernails.  That's what you did with this post /u/kittyislazy, you helped me.            Congratulations /u/notyourtowndrunk on your week sober.  Each day it gets easier and you will have, bit by bit, more clarity.  Stay strong.

We'll be counting on you then to get the check-in up from Sunday, July 4th through Saturday July 10th.   Is there any candidate more of an arrogant, smarmy, fuck than this guy?      Ha!  I sponsor a guy with 11 years from the time I had 4 years.  There are not hard and fast rules on this, it makes sense to ask someone who you respect and who you can see yourself listening to--who is steeped in the principles in recovery.      At least until this afternoon.  I'm now so used to a flooded basement that I prepare for it in advance, hah!  Acceptance, baby!   Good for you.  Time for you to do the morning check-in post.  Why not take next week?   Thank you, stranger on the internet.   Why don't you read through the [Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) to see if anything there makes sense as a place to start stopping.  It worked for me and plenty of others both on /r/stopdrinking and IRL.  Good luck to you.               I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; another beautiful day in Cleveland.  I plan to make the most of it.   I wrote this [post on this topic.  It's on the /r/alcoholism and in the SD sidebar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/2v573a/the_where_why_and_what_should_i_expect_at_my/)  Please update us and let us know how your first meeting goes!   Good for you, /u/dirtymartini74.  Also look at the daily check-in as a routine.  I find it very helpful.         I'm glad you're going to give SOBER a shot.     Welcome /u/Timetostop1989 to r/stopdrinking.  On the sidebar the results of the annual survey of our population is available.  It's a massive amount of information about almost every aspect of our demographic.  Amazingly, by far and away most of us stopped drinking cold turkey, and most of us reported little or no discomfort.    Now for how to go about it, why don't you look over the [Baby Steps post at this link?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  It has some good ideas for the "next things" you might want to consider as part of the move to sobriety.  Good luck to you.      Welcome /u/nocheesenoprob -- I'm one of the ancient mariners of SD, although Slip's got a few days on me. I'm a cyclist, bike commuter, and I live and work in Cleveland.  I'm also the guy who posts the [Baby Steps link for newcomers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  I hope to see you around.     I had to get rid of these notions of "I should feel...this or that."  We are all different, different DNA, different experiences within a spectrum.  What I do know that works is not drinking TODAY and dogged persistence.  Someone once told me: don't leave the room before the miracle occurs; and, miracles do occur in recovery.   Each day that you stay stopped is one day closer to real sobriety.  You know this because we are telling you so and we have credibility.  We have credibility on these topics because we've been there.    Good luck.   Here's what worked for me; don't drink TODAY no matter what and:   1. Recognize that the first two weeks will probably suck;  2. No coffee, caffeine of any sort after midday;  3. Shut off all electronics an hour before bedtime;   4. Except for soothing music.   Remember, many of us went through this and our body and brains are healing.  Sleep will come.  And usually when it does we reach a point where our bodies and brains want to do nothing BUT sleep.  That's ok too.  Good luck.   Wow, welcome back to life!  I'm moved by your courageous sharing of this post.     Welcome /u/ThePennyDropped -- good vent!  So at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is designed to suggest some good "next actions" to stopping drinking and getting sober.  These are the things that worked for me.  Good luck to you.   I will not drink TODAY in solidarity with you.   Good for you, /u/SDstrawburry -- I'm pulling for you.   Welcome /u/flow59 to r/stopdrinking.  Perhaps in your past visits to the sub you came across the [Baby Steps post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  That post lays out what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  The post attempts to suggest some good starter actions.  Good luck to you, I hope you get traction this time.        Posting and commenting serves others--and serves ourselves.      In my experience the way to never let the bad shit happen again is to start each day anew with the resolution not to drink TODAY, only and keep to that commitment.  It's amazing how quickly we can rebound and find the energy and momentum to turn our lives around especially if we actively work some sort of recovery program.  Remember it takes action not words.   You are doing a great job, super proud of you.         It's hard to believe that this ass-clown has a law license and a Harvard Law degree.  Apparently his oath to uphold the laws and constitution are secondary to his political pandering and ambition.   Welcome /u/SuperMegaCoolPerson to r/stopdrinking--I do the [things I describe at the Baby Steps post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  I do these things everyday.   This is so true.  My sponsor had 10 months of sobriety when I asked him to sponsor me.  I knew him previously from my profession.  He was a like a big brother to me and he has been for 30 years the same solid rock.     I agree with this 100%.   Recovery and sobriety works best, in my experience, when you do "service work"--and on /r/stopdrinking there are many opportunities to do service for the community as the morning Check-in volunteers demonstrate.  There are lots of other options, like commenting on newcomer posts, "attaboys and attagirls" for milemarker posts, and participation on the Chat, movie night, and so forth.  Find your niche, or invent it as others have done in the past and you may find that you are ahead of the game.     Obviously, I'm late to this post, but I wanted to congratulate you on accomplishing the challenge and for this terrific post.               I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; sober in soggy Cleveland!   [This is the link to my post on the meaning of Drinking Dreams after an email exchange with dream researchers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/)         Yeah, it took me sustained time sober to figure out the whole new life-thing.   Thirty days, ninety days, even 180 days were not enough to show me what it could really be.  Even now my horizons and happiness are expanding.        Welcome /u/redgalatea to /r/stopdrinking.  I'm sorry that you have struggled with relapse.  Relapse is a HUGE part of my story.  I also deal with, or dealt with manic-depression.  I got sober by doing the things I describe at the [Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  As far as programs and faith--I hear you.  I'm super happy with my agnostic AA meeting home group which has enabled me to fully dive into recovery.  Good luck to you.   Did you read through the [Baby Steps post?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  A lot of us on /r/stopdrinking  have used the ideas there to find a start to stopping. Good luck to you.   What?  Of course /r/law is the place for such distinctions.     By insistence in a dissent that it's my way or the highway; by inflammatory language, and through ad hominem attack on fellow justices.     Good for you.  You could always catch an out of town AA meeting.  I always found that an interesting adventure and something that advanced my sobriety.   Let me be clear then.  Scalia's snark heavy dissent does absolutely NOTHING for the respect of the law or our institutions, the constitution, the court, or comity.  Scalia, who invites readers of his dissent to "go ask the nearest  hippie"--appears to be tainted by his Opus Dei religious dogma and is apparently blind to his increasingly bizarre distortions.     Good for you.    But this brings to mind [the post called: The least popular advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2szkp8/the_least_popular_advice_dry_people_dry_places/)--which is dry people and dry places in early sobriety.  At 23 days sober there is no good reason to be in a club where the temptation to drink is ever present as you acknowledge.  Please be careful, my friend.     What an obnoxious post.  Prairie Home Companion is a significant media institution created by a formidable New Yorker writer that may elude your limited cultural understanding but which preserved, honored and satirized mid-twentieth century radio broadcasts; illustrated the history of the rural to urban transformation of America; and provided a weekly forum for all sorts of brilliant live music especially the obscure but worthy long before YouTube existed.  Your inability to grasp this fact does not render PHC or Keillor's artistic contributions invalid.    P.S. Keillor is a Mid-westerner not a New Englander.  Keillor has more authenticity in his little finger than most of artists whose performance altars the Reddit hivemind worship at.      His reasoning is INFECTED with rightwing Christian dogma.  That's what I meant.        Rock bottom is a metaphor not a place.  Everybody's rock bottom is different.  The only real question is when was I going to stop digging.  I didn't have to dig my way into professional disciplinary problems, federal prison, loss of reputation, material ruin--but I did.    I did find a way out and a way back via [the things I describe at the Baby Steps post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) I hope you'll join us in the sober life boat.   Good honest post.  That's where I was in relapse.  But I got back by not assuming that since I had previously been sober for 15 years I could skip the basic starter steps.  It's like a lot of things I used to be able to do--play guitar, speak Spanish...I had to go to the very beginning.  [Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)   Scalia seems to be stumbling over it.   I can't wait to see this!   Sustained time sober solved all my sleep disorders.  In the interim I would limit the caffeine to the early part of your day; not drink too much water 90 minutes before bedtime; and, I'd go with relaxing music in the half hour before sleep.      When I first stopped drinking, I scoured this sub, looking for posts from people with lots of time, trying to figure out what their lives looked like. What had changed? What was better? This is going to be worth it, right?  You answered the question for yourself.  The answer was always there--inside yourself.  No one could answer for you for that very reason.       NO.  No, binge eating is not as bad as binge drinking.  I never drove a car into the rear of another car in an automated carwash on potato chips.  I never went to prison on a pint of ice cream.  Of course, compulsive eating is a SERIOUS disorder that should not be ignored, but we shouldn't minimize our obligation to deal with first things first.     I will not drink TODAY in solidarity with you.  You did a masterful job of describing the same thinking and feeling I had around my relapse after 15 continuous years of sobriety.  Two weeks of control and genius drinking which descended quickly into abysmal addict drinking that lasted for 7 years. It was a miracle that I got back at all.                       I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; in the immortal words of Antonin Scalia; go ask a hippie!   Except for the obnoxious title--the article really does capture this singular perspective.         I know.  It's a hipster-ism.        That's exactly right.  The other part of this is--conservatives throw around "unconstitutional, tyranny, activist Judges"-argument forgetting that the SCOTUS and many of these judges are THEIR appointees: Kennedy, Roberts, and so forth.  In other words, their constitutional scholars would beg to disagree.   My wife drinks.  But I have a completely developed support system of friends and activities that are SOBER.     Do you need any further reminder why the GOP can not be trusted with lifetime appointments to the federal courts?      Well-done /u/pickpickpick for making this connection.   I can see how this feels this way for you IF the only thing you are doing is being alcohol abstinent. In my experience this is called being restless, irritable and discontent, aka, the RIDs.  The answer for me was getting ACTIVE in recovery--by activity in recovery I found new ways to reinforce my sobriety with new friends, new activities, and new daily rituals.     Hang in there /u/xXThrowaway71Xx -- this is life on life's terms.  If I told you about the challenges of my first year of my current sobriety you might be shocked.  But I got invaluable face-to-face support every day at AA meetings.    Words that are detached from reality.               This is an excellent point.  If he were a sitting local judge he would draw ethics complaints for this sort of nonsense.     My mistake.             No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilizations oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.   http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf   [The Opinion.](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf)         I remember falling off a pink cloud, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't at 25 days into sobriety.  What I'm saying is this: early sobriety is a roller coaster of emotions with highs (probably not pink clouds) and lows.  Don't drink today, and I would bet that sometime, 90 days or so from now--a real pink cloud might really give you a ride of your life.  That's my experience.   I have to have courage when things don't go my way or aren't the way I believe they should be.  So in being courageous I win the inevitable wrestling match with MY ego.  I drop my narcissistic obsession with how I am perceived or how I perceive myself and I do what's right.  Sometimes what's right is merely to accept reality.     Quite a thought-experiment, that.  Lessee, Bill-O would convene morality panels.  Hannity would be in high-dundgeon.  It would be endless.   When I was a newcomer to sobriety my sponsor (who gave me most of the ideas that became the [Baby Steps)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) post laughed when I told him that there was no way I could do 90 AA meetings in 90 days.  He asked, How many days a week did you drink?  How many days a week were you in bars and liquor stores?  How many days a week were you hungover?    AA meetings provided me with sober friends, sober activities, and a path to my authentic self.                       I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; happy Friday in SD world!   That's just great. I am so happy for you.        Hey, /u/hasvegetables I've been right where you are: filled with guilt and remorse and uncertain how to proceed.  Fortunately, my AA sponsor gave me some simple steps forward which along with lots of other info that I've picked up over time I've included in something I call the [Baby Steps which you can find at this link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  I learned to do the simple sober things on a daily basis and I can quite assure you that I don't carry a load of guilt or shame or remorse around with me anymore.  Good luck to you.               Certainly at least 6 experts on constitutional law disagree with him.      Amazing news, opinion, dissent, and political discussion in /r/politics and r/law.   You really capture the essence of life behind bars.  I came back from my 5 months at FCI, Morgantown in 2010 and I told my wife that I was so angry at myself for feeling absolute hatred for some people I knew and resided with in those months.  Sadly, there have been at least one occasion since with a guy in AA where I felt those same feelings, so I strongly relate to this post.  Now imagine that your confidentiality is breached--things you said in a meeting were shared "on the yard."  Wow.     That's a bullseye.   Welcome /u/sbarks to r/stopdrinking.  Personally, I found it ultimately not relevant that I answer *a priori* the question: Am I an alcohlic?  What I needed instead was some sustained time sober and the clarity that brings.  So at this [link is a set of ideas called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is based on my own experiences stopping drinking and getting sober.  I hope something there will be helpful to you.  Good luck.   That's AWESOME!   Welcome /u/ElSaborAsiatico to r/stopdrinking.

[On the meaning of Drinking Dreams.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/)   Congratulations, db!    In a democracy, the power to make the law rests with those chosen by the people. Our role is more confinedto say what the law is. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). That is easier in some cases than in others. But in every case we must respect the role of the Legislature, and take care not to undo what it has done. A fair reading of legislation demands a fair understanding of the legislative plan.   Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them. If at all possible, we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter. Section 36B can fairly be read consistent with what we see as Congresss plan, and that is the reading we adopt            That was the juxtaposition I was hoping for when I linked it this morning.          The CJ's opinion is well written particularly as it relates to the whole history and how so much of O-care is based on Romney-care.

 TFA don't reject the idea that poverty (etc) are crucial to student outcomes, but they believe that good teachers can mitigate this issue - which studies back up.  e.g. http://obs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/chetty/w19424.pdf "Using school district and tax records for more than one million children, we nd that students assigned to high-[Value Added] teachers in primary school are more likely to attend college, earn higher salaries, live in higher SES neighborhoods, and have higher savings rates"  There are many other studies and they do control for factors such as parental education, location, poverty etc.  Parents wages are the biggest determinant of a child's outcomes, but this can be mitigated by good teaching.    I'd be curious to see the evidence that most TFA teachers are ineffective. The latest study I've found, from 2013, says: TFA teachers were more effective than the teachers with whom they were compared. On average, students assigned to TFA teachers scored 0.07 standard deviations higher on end-of-year math assessments than students assigned to comparison teachers, a statistically significant difference. This impact is equivalent to an additional 2.6 months of school for the average student nationwide.  http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/20134015/pdf/20134015.pdf      I can't speak on many of the points you raise, but as someone who taught for 3 years under the British equivalent - Teach First - I can offer some opinions.  I do worry about very TF heavy schools - I think that TF'ers get better by taking advantage of the experience of more established teachers.   I do think students can lose - to an extent. For the first 4-6 months I was an appalling teacher - I let down my students and I felt awful about it. My solution was to work longer and longer hours planning, only to arrive exhausted to teach my overprepared lesson. However, the same is true (in the UK) of many going into teaching through other routes. Most teachers in the UK do a standard PGCE where they spend a few months at uni and a school helping another teacher, then slowly taking over classes - many of them are not good teachers. In my experience, when you compared a TF'er and a PGCSE'er after one year, the TF'er was a hands down better teacher. They were in a much better situation in year two when the PGCSE teacher had entirely his own classes, and the TF'er had done so for a year.  The training isn't enough to make anyone a good teacher at the start, and if TFA is anything like TF training, then it isn't meant to be. It's about giving you the evaluating tools, and the legal knowledge to go into a school. TF'ers are expected to teach themselves to teach - by watching, reflecting and evaluating.   It is true many leave to go into other careers, I left after 3 years (2 years being the TF mandatory course). The drop out rates in the UK are similar to that of other training routes for teachers. I actually think teachers doing other things is a good thing - I want people who have been in a classroom leading businesses and political institutions - with the will and understanding to make a change in education.  TF/TFA isn't all good, but it certainly isn't all bad - and I think it has a place in modern education.

Your Harvard degree certificate signals you are a high achieving, high skill employer - it no doubt gets you the interview.   If you are entirely fraudulent in your degree, there is a good chance you lack the human capital needed for the job, and you would not get it. If you do have the skills necessary, it will still come down to part-luck on whether YOU get it rather than someone else similar (because Signalling theory relies on the idea that you cannot accurately gauge human capital in an easy manner - it is very costly to do so).

They have had success in preventing Google and Microsoft abusing their dominant position. They are forcing mobile phone companies to drop roaming charges.   There will always be abuses by multinationals you can point to, but the EU has a better chance of managing it than the UK alone.   Except that the EU regulations are the same throughout - so when 50% of the trade must meet one set of regulations it's better to have influence on those standards than not.   The WTO has almost nothing to do with the nature of the regulations and important criteria unless someone is actually putting up protectionist tariffs. The 8% vote isn't the only issue here - it's the seat at the table to discuss it. The vote simply gives you some clout so people will listen.  TTIP would make the world $600 billion better off - you would be a fool to reject it. The faster we abolish most if not all the special protection cases the better. It's stalled because of the political deadlock in the US.   Finally, don't make up stuff about what the EU can and cannot do. The reality is that it HAS suspended talks on Swiss participation in Erasmus+ and Horizon 2020 (worth 80 billion) because of Switzerland blocking the free flow of labour.  Study economics, rather than a UKIP leaflet, you will be more qualified to have this debate.      I think you misunderstand - the EU has no interest in trade sanctions against the UK for leaving. The problem is that many goods imported into the EU must meet certain regulations - the UK currently has influence over what those criteria are - if we left we would lose that. We would lose any benefits accrued from the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the US (estimated benefit of $600 billion to trade).   Switzerland abides by EU regulations but cannot shape them. Look at what happened recently with the Swiss trying to prevent the free flow of people into Switzerland from other EU countries - this is likely to result in both EU sanctions and Switzerland's expulsion from the fairly lucrative Erasmus programme.    Because we would have just left the one organisation big and powerful enough to take on the multinationals - the EU.   Which would be great, except that China accounts for 3.38% of Switzerland's exports and the EU accounts for 50%   I agree with 1. I think the second point is that he is giving the Lib Dems a unique selling point in being the only clearly pro-EU party (since Labour are pandering to both sides, and Tories are stuck in internal politicking)  Cameron doesn't stand a chance in creating a "new deal" - why would the EU let him. Half of UK trade is with the EU, we rely on them.    Switzerland has to abide by most of the EU trade rules (in order to conduct its trade) and can do nothing to influence them. Not a great deal.   As has been mentioned with cold reading, expect to hear opposites which cover all bases. e.g.  "I can see that you are a social person, but that you value your privacy when you have it"   or comments applying to most people "You find yourself less confident when around a large number of people you don't know"            Taught for three years then essentially went back to what I was doing before teaching   Consider the length of time it will take to pass the conch from student to student compared with hands up. You may find it is more time consuming than anything else   Campaigns Manager in Biomedical Research   The activists who have been "visiting" their house on a monthly basis have been the same ones for years. During the times in which they've had their houses flooded and cars set alight.   Regardless of the legality, standing outside someone's house every month screaming abuse at them in harassment.          I left a message - please leave a comment at the bottom (no need to sign up) to show your support for scientists being harassed         yes ... yes it is            This made me chuckle. While I agree about less bias in the UK, I wouldn't have picked the Daily Mail as my example (they are a terribly biased paper) - though I do agree with the article in this case.         Another perspective with a few more graphs: http://speakingofresearch.com/2014/01/20/public-opinion-on-animal-research-in-italy-2014/      Animal research is far, far more expensive that the alternatives (bar human trials).   Those alternatives, where they exist, are used - particularly in cosmetics (the EU has banned animal use because those alternatives exist), but those alternatives don't answer all questions. If you want to understand the impact of a single gene, there is little else you can use other than genetically altered animals (for instance) - no computer program or cell culture will answer this question.   Might want to do more reading on Roselli's research: http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2007/02/wool_and_graze.html The research aimed to understand the biological roots of homosexuality, not cure it. Particularly read to the end:  "Differences among motives matter, even when they're subtle. PETA has made hay of a 2000 paper in which Stormshak posited that gay rams "may not be exposed to the same levels" of estrogen as straight rams. "If this is true," he wrote, then estrogen therapy "might alter their sexual behavior to the point of being more like" the behavior of straight rams. PETA thinks this study threatens to advance the eradication of homosexuality.  But look more closely. The paper's title is "Influence of castration and estrogen replacement on sexual behavior of female-oriented, male-oriented, and asexual rams." And that's what the study examines: All the rams, not just the gay ones, are castrated and given estrogen. The point isn't to make the gay rams straight; it's to "restore sexual behavior" in general. And the experiment fails. Stormshak concludes:      Because there are no readily apparent phenotypic traits that characterize the male-oriented or asexual ram, these animals are frequently selected as flock sires and hence contribute to decreased fertility of ewes and economic loss to the sheep industry. Treatment of these types of rams with estrogens to enhance their sexual behavior or performance may not be practical."   The researchers can get paid to do new or old research, but think about those funding it. They have a limited pot of cash which they use to give out grants. It is not financially sensible to get researchers to keep doing the same experiment (remember all of this will be published, and researchers cannot get ahead in life doing repetitive research). No one wins by repeating work, everyone wins by doing new and innovative research. Your claims simply do not fit common sense logic.  Cosmetic testing is becoming a smaller and smaller area - it's already banned across the EU, and has wound down in many countries (China as a possible exception). You don't need to test a cosmetic on an animal to get it passed regulators in the US. So most companies avoid it.   Why on earth are you using sources which are OVER 30 YEARS OLD. The funding environment, as well as the animal welfare act has changed in that time.   However, many incidents of people claiming repetitive research is going on comes down to others not understanding the difference between two similar-looking, but fundamentally different, bits of research    Why would people fund repetition - it won't generate anyone money in the future. Animal research is hugely expensive and only used where they cannot find another method.    It's a reminder of the big researcher led counter protests to defend animal research in:  Oxford, UK: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/4750516.stm  Los Angeles, USA: http://speakingofresearch.com/get-involved/ucla-pro-test/#3  Milan, Italy: http://www.understandinganimalresearch.org.uk/news/2013/06/pro-test-italia-demonstrate-the-value-of-animal-research/      well spotted ... as a Native English speaker I should have got that right.

 It's not anything like that.  It's a courtesy to you, so that you have ample time to refill at your convenience before you run out of meds. :/   If I were in this situation, I'd either mail some to myself or empty all but the amount I need into another container for storage, and bring enough for the vacation in the original branded bag.  Either one seems like a safe bet to me, given the relatively low stakes.   The only problem is with the MSM being mistaken for some other illegal substance (cocaine, anthrax, etc).  You should not bring more than you need, and should bring it in its original labeled container with the supplement label etc.  You shouldn't declare it or anything, but you also shouldn't try to hide it.  Just pack it in the bottom of your bag.  You're probably better off putting it in your checked baggage if you have any, as the standards for screening checked baggage are less strict than for carry on luggage (baggage that you have no access to doesn't pose the same security risk).  There is a chance they will find it and throw it away, leaving you to buy new MSM at your destination.   Yeah - this is terrible advice.  It basically guarantees that if discovered, the MSM will be assumed to be an illegal drug and OP a smuggler.    I think I'm more on the opposite end of semantics here, in that I think the distinction is meaningless because what we think of as "material" includes things like gravity and consciousness; there is no "immaterial" point of reference. We can safely assume that these properties are part of the material realm because we can't go about seeing if those things exist in the absence of any physical matter whatsoever (and given what we understand about space and such, seems like in the closest thing to that kind of setting, those things don't show up). As in, the whole idea of "immaterial" doesn't make sense because it lacks reference to anything we could experience. Our being there to experience it would necessarily invalidate what it is. Hopefully that makes sense. It's late and that was a long one.  I'm having a hard time seeing how your view here differs from the apparent neutral monism you say it contrasts with.  How do you define "material" and "physical"?  From your treatment, it almost seems like you've assumed our observations of reality are of something material as a starting point.   Food for thought...   What you smoking marijuana for?  You gay?   Sacramento is a huge liberal city.  The rest of the central valley is a rural conservative farmtown wasteland.   Well, perhaps it could happen there; I could also imagine it.  But the vast majority of Americans, including me, don't live in small towns where everyone knows each other...   Haha - OP isn't even addicted to opiates.  Kratom's only indication in assuaging the effects of withdrawal is as a replacement for another opiate - sort of like methadone treatment.  Replace one addiction with another.  But OP doesn't even have an opiate addiction to start with. :P   Ah; I understand now.  I had thought that your mention of Lexapro was only tangentially related to your withdrawal, having assumed that you were addicted to an opiate or stimulant.  It seems unlikely that your main complaints were caused by the reduction in your dose of Lexapro; the % change in dose is small, and you're still solidly within the normal therapeutic dose range.  If your symptoms were caused by the drop in dose, it is unlikely that you'll continue to experience them for long.  SSRI withdrawal generally resolves within a week-ish, and intense symptoms are usually even more brief.  Have you considered the possibility that your symptoms are being caused by something else?  Perhaps you could investigate other potential causes that you could eliminate (e.g. hormonal birth control, stress, diet / lack of nutrition, lack of exercise, lack of social contact, some bodily illness or infection).  There are many ways that a person could come to feel anxious, nauseous, and alone - most of which have little to do with small changes in the dose of an SSRI.   :/  I didn't say "let's debate it right here and now"; I merely stated that it is open to debate.  You seem to agree, considering your attempt to debate the topic with me. :P   OP, what drug are you withdrawing from?  What was your habit like, and how long did you have it?  I know your life must be very painful right now, and apparently has been for awhile...but this *will* pass, and you *can* endure it and come out the other side.  Try to keep a larger perspective, consider how short this time is relative to what time lies ahead for you.   The lecture itself, which ended before the linked section from the OP, is much more dense with content than is the Q/A.  At least watch the second half of it (starting ~20 minutes in) so you will understand what Chomsky is on about when he says there is no body and that physicality is so ill-defined that no coherent mind-body problem can be posed.  It isn't so naive as it might look if you just stumbled into the Q/A without an understanding of the topic at hand.   Chomsky is building on a foundation that he laid out earlier in the talk.  You would probably understand where he is coming from when he invokes the non-existence of body and the lack of coherent meaning in the term physical in the Q/A if you watched at least the latter half of the talk itself; he offered considerable context from analytic philosophy and science.  Whatever flaws exist in the ideas Chomsky presented in the lecture and Q/A, it is unlikely that any of them arose from an ignorance of the literature.  The talk begins ~1 minute into the video, and concludes ~40 minutes in with the start of the question / answer period.   Your initial comment *was* reasonably inflammatory.  You seem to think you're on the moral high ground in this thread, but you are antagonizing your partner in debate.  Neither of you is writing in a manner consistent with the etiquette of this sub.   That's a ridiculous way to frame the systemic problem of police brutality in the United States.  If it's all about individuals and their failings, why is the justice system organized so as to encourage this kind of behavior and protect those who do it?   Makes sense; thanks for sharing.  Where I come from, if you created such a scene like that running from police, when they finally did catch you (and they certainly would), you'd likely be surrounded by highly aroused shouting cops with firearms drawn.  You'd be fortunate to survive the arrest without injury, and to afford bail so as not to wait several weeks in jail for a court date.   Where did this all take place, your story from your teenage years?  In America, where I am from, I seriously doubt running from the police like that could lead to anything but arrest and likely injury.    And what if the state is absolutely terrible in providing education and health care? What if the state does other things with the funds it takes in, things that are not only not beneficial to society but destructive?   This is what keeps libertarianism relevant, in my view.  Parapolikala's state enforced taxation to provide everyone with the basic necessities of modern life as a fair compromise would be very appealing **if it worked.**  Whether it has been shown to work is, I think, quite open to debate.   LSD and peas and carrots go together like music? :O   Fair enough, yeah.  There wasn't much to the post and it did seem a bit moralistic.   I understand your point, but disagree that this would necessarily solve the problem of excess salt.  If that were true, then surplus would never be a problem.   There's a lot there; some of it is plainly absurd, such as the claim that the cardiac cycle has been refuted as the driving force of the circulatory system.  Other parts of the article seem quite reasonable, such as the brief review of the lack of scientific consensus on the role of mattress / bedding selection in the treatment of lower back pain (nothing to debunk there - results are conflicting and few).  Much of the article consists of non-controversial statements of fact, such as the fact that hard surface sleeping has long been common in Japan.  Nothing to debunk there - it's true!   /r/hailcorporate ?   Misleading title. Not the UN, but one individual who used to work in the UN.   Similarly to the Mona Lisa example, the title To Kill a Mockingbird invokes a far more specific image, and one that is far less relevant to contemporary art than is the image of the dark side of the moon.  The fact that "the dark side of the moon" is the title of an album does not mean that the only use for the phrase is to reference prior work.   Wait for her to come home one night and just start a conversation about anything, then if you notice her pupils are dilated you could call her on it.   This sounds like a great way to alienate your sister, OP. :/   I don't see how there is any conflict no matter what I admit or don't.  Who cares if two artistic works invoke the same image?   Octarine core gives 450 HP and +4 HP regen, +400 mana and +100% mana regen.  It has a decent build up if you start with the soul booster, aiding in survival and mana pool in the early midgame if timed correctly.  But it is questionable, as you said, to build such an expensive item that gives no stats for your illusions.   Are you REALLY CLAIMING that the artist who titled this song didnt assume that 99.9999% of people would think of pink floyd when they heard the title.  Not in particular, no.  I'm saying that there are plenty of reasons to reference the dark side of the moon in art that have nothing to do with an album by Pink Floyd.  A person can have more than one reason for doing something, you know.  I don't see a problem with it.  Dark Side of the Moon was a great album that invoked the image of the dark side of the moon; this was a nice song that invoked the image of the dark side of the moon.  Where is the conflict?     As a vegetarian, I honestly have no attraction to eating meat - with the possible exception of fish.  I would eat lab-grown tofu, and possibly lab-grown fish, supposing that a reasonable expectation of safety could be established.   That may be..but don't you think the stance of U.S. politicians on this topic is heavily influenced by the religious views of the country's massive Christian population?   Pshh, you just came here to be cranky. :P   I disagree.  Your only possible reason for calling your painting the Mona Lisa is to reference the existing painting called Mona Lisa.  There are plenty of reasons to reference the dark side of the moon in art that have nothing to do with an album by Pink Floyd.   http://www.threyda.com/collections/Simon-Haiduk  This is the artist's page on the site written in the lower left of the image.  It's apparently sold there in high quality prints.   Yeah, Tahoe is nice.   There are different kinds of probiotic supplement.  Follow the directions on your supplement.  Most are intended for use on an empty stomach.   I guess we disagree, haha.  I think it's disrespectful to unnecessarily limit the range of today's artists on the basis of what a past generation did.   And the endless suburban sprawl heat island thing   Eh...it's a powerful, fairly obvious image.  I don't think there having been one great album with that title should preclude its use in other artwork indefinitely.   That is not necessarily true.  It could be that pizza shops of that size, profit margin, and rent are no longer viable businesses.   Geordi killed the shapeshifting alien with his phaser in Aquiel (Season 6).   Wesley took part in illegal maneuvers with the academy flight team that resulted in one member's death (bit of a stretch) in Season 5.   I think there is definitely influence, but nothing nearly this strong.  I've witnessed several DMT-naive people - people who had little or no exposure to writings on DMT, to whom the experience had not been particularly talked up - use DMT for their first time.  Not all of the people whose first time's I've witnessed experienced explicit entity contact, but all reported a sense of contact with another presence or consciousness, and about half reported explicit contact with entities external to themselves.  This, combined with the general culture around DMT, and the results of Rick Strassman's work with it, have been enough to convince me that DMT has a direct effect on humans that tends to produce entity contact experiences.  In my view, it takes quite a lot more mental gymnastics and evidence denial to believe that DMT *doesn't* have some entity contact experience producing effect.    edit:  I remain agnostic as to the actual nature of these experiences.  It seems quite clear to me that nobody knows what's going on with them, except in those cases where the experience is clearly generated from one's personal psychology.   That's not true in many industries.  Labor is often the largest single cost by far, especially in service industries.  This is almost certainly true for the restaurant in the article.  According to the article, the owner has 12 employees.  The minimum wage went up by ~$4.  Supposing the workers average a 30 hour work week, the new minimum wage likely cost an additional ~$7000 a month.  Profit margins are usually quite low for small restaurants.  $7000 a month isn't trivial.   Heh...no need to be rude.  It's not such a difficult error to make.   I think you missed my point.  What do you think the gap of 80.2 represents?  Do you believe that it represents a difference in pay between men and women working similar jobs with similar levels of experience and education?   There are only 4 participants in that study, and comparisons are only made within subjects. :/   The supplement's label answers your question.  To be sold in the United States, supplements must conform to very specific labeling requirements.  Notice that the label states zinc content, *not* zinc monomethionine content.  It also states the % of the FDA's recommended intake.  Serving Size: 1 Tablet  Zinc (as zinc monomethionine [OptiZinc]) 30 mg 200%  Take one tablet a day or less.  Don't take more - excessive zinc supplementation can hurt you fairly easily.   Yes - this could be a great improvement on existing treatment.  But it's true that this treatment is little more than a revision of the L-dopa approach.  Can't make enough dopamine?  Buy these magic nano-dopamine pills from me for the rest of your life...    Sure thing - glad to help.  I'd just buy a creatine supplement, the cheapest simplest one you can find, and take the recommended dose for a few days before the test (including the morning of the test).  Drink whatever feels normal, then add a half gallon or so to that.  You don't want to give them a water sample, but you do want it to be dilute.  You can get a feel for this by doing a test run where you take the B-vitamin supplement and drink a ton of water, then see if your urine is still yellow.   I agree.  It is still worth discussion - and worth investigating, understanding better, and changing.  But that doesn't change the fact that it is disingenuous for a politician to use misleading figures such as the 78% gap to try to gain support from ignorant voters.  Bernie Sanders apparently called out for "equal pay for equal work" to correct a 78% pay gap that **does not exist**.  That is objectionable.   Nobody can reasonably claim that there is no gender gap at all - but the gap is only substantial when differences in career choice, hours worked, and years worked are ignored.  If you read the linked sources in their entirety you will see that they support Gottlob's position and undermine the position that a substantial gap exists.  The numbers you've quoted do not take these factors into account.   He should do it in short videos that show a before / during / after of him enjoying the product.   It's really just down to how you feel about it.  There won't be any danger nor any cross-tolerance.  I don't think it's a big deal.  If you feel up to it and want to trip again, go ahead. :)   The method I linked to addresses this, has for a decade+.  You just supplement creatine; creatinine is a metabolite of this.   The artist works in a grocery store.   Hopefully that's just for the scans...   Being slim may give you some advantage, as THC and its metabolites are stored in fat.  Drinking water will not increase the rate at which your body processes and excretes THC and its metabolites - that is false.  The rate depends on things like liver enzymes and fat metabolism, not urination and kidney filtration.  Exercising may, as it could increase the turnover of THC and metabolites stored in your body fat.  This is more likely to be of importance to an overweight person with a heavy load of THC / metabolites in their fat; for you as a slim, light user who has plenty of time to abstain, it is unlikely to matter.  I think your chances are quite high.  Obviously, there's no good data on this; no scientist would study this, there's no reason and no grant money.  But I have personally passed a couple tests this way under worse conditions than yours, and have seen friends do the same.  This advice is quite old - I first used it nearly a decade ago - and there are many anecdotal reports online spanning that entire time period, of people using it successfully.  For what it's worth, if I were in your shoes, I wouldn't sweat it.  If you want some assurance, you could do a home test using this method a week from now and see if you pass.  Or you could even pay a testing company to do you, if the job is really important.  Just don't use the same one as your employer, haha. :)   Ah - good reply, you gave a ton of useful info.  You should be able to pass if it's at least two weeks away, and you're willing to abstain completely until the test. :)  It wouldn't be worth trying to pass a fake sample unless the situation makes it quite easy, or abstaining would be extremely stressful.  Employers rarely do drug testing themselves, but instead have you go to a testing company that they pay to collect and analyse your sample.  Often there will be somebody watching you through a one-way mirror.  Not right in front of you, but back and to the side.  So there is some privacy, but not too much.  If they are conducting their own test using a cheap kit, then you can probably pass that with ease through simple dilution + B vitamins - and you can predict the result by testing yourself as you suggested.  But even with the lab testing (which is cheap and quite common), you have every reason to believe you can pass.   [Just follow the standard method summarized here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/33vb0i/i_have_to_pass_a_drug_test_in_three_weeks_and_i/cqop3vx)    It really depends on what drugs you use, how often and at what doses, how soon the test is, and on how likely you are to succeed if you attempt to use something other than your own urine.  In most drug test/screen (synonymous) situations, it would actually be quite difficult to deliver anything but your own urine, coming out of your own body, without being detected.  It is also pretty easy to clean up your own urine if you have a few days (most drugs) or a few weeks (marijuana) of lead time.  Therefore, it is usually preferable to use your own urine and try to make it as clean as possible.  How soon is the test, and what will it involve?   Sure, that seems fair enough.  But I guess nobody else in /r/trees cares about the actual definition of socialism.   This isn't the question though.  OP wants to understand *why*.   It's reasonably likely that clonazepam that can be absorbed sublingually can also be absorbed through insufflation.   **ALWAYS.** :O   Expiscor is correct in their assessment that socialism requires collective ownership of the means of production and an overthrow of capitalism.  That doesn't mean socialism and communism are one and the same; it just means they share this feature.  This isn't a matter of public opinion, but of political science.    No - ephedra is legal, though much more difficult to get in the US these days.  Though in many regions, it can be found growing in great abundance.  It is very easy to make tea from, but basically impossible to dose accurately unless you have prior experience and are willing to titrate the dose (start small, slowly build up).  Supplements derived from it are illegal, though.   I don't know; a quick google search should turn up a range of recommendations.  Ephedrine is sometimes used as a bronchodilator for people with asthma; if you're reasonably young and healthy, you probably can't go wrong using dosage recommendations for that as a starting point.   Well, sure - low gi filling foods + calorie counting are a pretty good way to create a caloric deficit without feeling like you're starving yourself.  But that alone won't prevent muscle loss while dieting; you need to lift, eat enough protein, and use a reasonable deficit and cycle length.  Stimulants have long been popular with dieters because they allow you to more easily create and tolerate the caloric deficit.  You can't lose much weight without changing your diet; EC stack will not create a deficit large enough on its own.  But it can make dieting easier.   I can't say whether you should or shouldn't, but assuming you're in good health and not at risk for heat stroke or something (e.g. you don't work outdoors in the heat all day, you aren't a senior citizen) it hardly seems like a big deal.  Lots of things increase your body temp.  If you get too hot, you'll feel too hot.  As long as you're in a situation where you can sweat and drink water, and find relief if necessary, I don't see a problem.   Jackolysis is right, as far as I know; you can buy it in any pharmacy.  But it's kept behind the counter in some regions, because of abuse potential.  It's still a non-prescription medicine, though, so you can just walk up and ask for it.  If they want to know why, you could say your doctor told you to use it for your cough/asthma/etc.  As for Ephedra...I don't see any advantage.  It's the same active chemical.  But using a pharmaceutical version allows you to take precisely measured doses, which is very important for safety and comfort when using strong stimulants.   If you want to lose fat, you have to eat less energy than you use; there is no way around this, none at all.  Whether you create an energy deficit with supplements + diet + exercise, or just diet, or diet+exercise, you have to deal with potential loss of muscle mass.   [Asked once before, apparently has worked for one person](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/24mwrc/lexapro_escitalopram_and_lsd/)   Just because an act is performed by a group does not mean that it is a communal effort.  And just because each individual in the group has their own selfish motives, doesn't mean the act isn't collective.  It's a false dichotomy.  Looting has a necessary collective aspect, which is that it involves a group of people all shoplifting together (as All-the-post-leftist pointed out).   Certain stimulants can be used to make the not eating and cardio easier, and to give a *modest* boost to resting fat metabolism.  Everything else is either bullshit or has such a small effect that it really isn't worth worrying about.   Good to know; do you know why it's not recommended?   ECA stack (ephedrine / caffeine / aspirin).  Won't kill you unless you already have heart disease, in which case it'll kill you.  Works primarily by destroying your appetite, but also increases thermogenesis.  Most other fat burning supplements are lies and/or unicorn tears.   In short - no.  His work can't be ELI5ed.  But if you put some effort into reading *Being and Time*, as H_C_Everybody suggested, and then come back and ask for clarification, you'll probably be able to wrap your head around it with minimal effort.   Sure, I mean, that sounds great...but so what?  I enjoyed the Power of Now and feel that it's a valuable book.  I've recommended the book to friends before.  But I still find it disingenuous of Eckhart Tolle to present other people's ideas, slightly reworded and simplified, without offering readers some mention of the context these ideas came from.  To be fair, he often mentions other traditions in his work.  But I found he also often left out the source of his ideas.  It's a reasonable critique. *shrug*   Sure.  We could easily agree to condemn looters, but it remains utterly irrelevant to the larger political action that occurred / is occurring in the form of riots and demonstrations sans looting.  A minority of participants looted, yet media have been successful at making looting a huge part of every conversation about the riot.  Why?   Great analysis.  There may be room for some extremely useful innovations with things like high value craigslist purchases, car sales by owner, etc, if a good in-person sale escrow system can be implemented.   If you're open to using powders, you can save a lot of money by purchasing bulk powder supplements online - especially on things like EGCG, 5HTP, and joint supplements.   Instead of trying to figure out what it is, why don't you just do it with your friends repeatedly...and gradually slip in turns of phrase used by Vulcans.  If you start slow, you could eventually cultivate a local group of trippers who get together to take a drug called Logic and talk like Star Trek cosplayers.  Isn't that possibility more important than determining the exact identity of this substance?  Logic demands it!   /r/iamverysmart   That isn't a fair assessment at all.  *Some* people seem to have taken advantage of the situation to loot.  So what?  That doesn't make the entire effort illegitimate.   That's disgusting...and what the fuck does it have to do with /r/trees ?  Come on.   I have, at least most of it.  I haven't looked at any of Eckhart Tolle's work in a few years now.  I enjoyed *The Power of Now* a lot.  I found it very accessible, but somewhat disingenuous in that his work is extremely derivative - at times, to the point that he is simply restating Buddhist teachings in simplified form - but he often presents his ideas as though they're original.   You're not broken. You're just less attached to the material world.   Ehh...to me, that really feels like writing a fairy tale about why it's ok not to feel sad about it.  Just because OP isn't having a natural and expected emotional reaction to the death of a loved one, doesn't mean it's because OP isn't attached to the material plane.  It seems more likely that OP is emotionally repressed, disconnected.  Maybe intellectually dominated.  Nothing to celebrate or bemoan, but something that can easily pass with some space and time.  OP if it bothers you, you might try setting aside more time to exist in your body, without a goal or purpose.  Like, time to watch clouds go by and walk down the street aimlessly or to do yoga or something.   [HAIL CORPORATE](/r/hailcorporate)   It appears to only count one vote per IP.   You're welcome, yeah.  I wish I had a good article handy to link to; you could probably find one in /r/kava .  The reason I used alcohol is because it is widely used, has a long history of human use, and is generally recognized as safe for daily use in strict moderation (1 or 2 drinks, depending on your liver capacity).  It is very dangerous for regular use at higher doses, and in single very high doses.  But it serves as a good comparison, I think, because most people will accept a drug that is safer than alcohol as safe for daily use.   I've always found a better price per gram of DHA/EPA by buying it in softgels.  It's also more convenient if you're travelling to have pills instead of a bottle.  Just be sure you're comfortable with whatever number of pills you'll have to swallow to get the dose you want.  A lot of companies offer really low dose softgels that aren't worth the inconvenience.   My understanding is that there are a couple of very specific scientific findings and a lot of speculation in that paragraph, but that there is no clear evidence for the timeline you propose.  Do you have a reference for that timeline?   This is what I mean, though.  You're assuming the worst about this person's assumptions.  They're been quoted saying   This research is unethical.  and you've taken that to mean something like "genetic modification in humans is unethical, both now and for the foreseeable future."  You say that   He's saying even researching the concept to learn how to do it safely is wrong.  But how do you know?  Perhaps what he said was in the context of a reasonable, though bold, critique of this specific experiment.  Even if his comment was in fact meant in the worst possible interpretation, by giving a charitable interpretation, you could add something to the discussion by exploring reasonable critiques to this sort of research, instead of childishly lampooning an obviously untenable position.   That isn't actually quite true.  The kava liver toxicity was from extracts sold in pill form, occurred in a very small number of people relative to the number of people using it, and hasn't recurred.  Yet even if that level of toxicity occurred at that same frequency in traditional kava use (which it doesn't), it would still be safer than alcohol - which is well known to cause liver toxicity with regular use.  :)   That hardly seems like a charitable interpretation.  It seems quite obvious to me that reasonable, well-informed people can disagree about the ethics of human genetic engineering at this stage of scientific understanding.   Oh come on. :/  Everybody knows that rectal administration is the only way for a modern Kantian; the science-camera-hole method died out in the mid-90s (thank goodness it did).  Other than that, I'd say this is about right, and certainly enough to cover the scope of your assignment.   Whatever, dude.  If you have good information to the contrary, please share it.  Otherwise, I'll remain agnostic about the exact threshold of MDMA neurotoxicity in humans...   Haha...yeah, that's pretty much it for side effects for folks with a reliable pharmaceutical grade source who don't do risky combinations and either don't IV or use correct IV practices.  Doesn't seem like a bad deal until you do the price math...   To be fair, I didn't say that it was - only that it certainly isn't safe any more frequently.  It's possible that people can safely take low-moderate doses of MDMA every week or two; I don't think it's known either way.   Try practicing mindfulness meditation, following your breath.  You can get instruction easily by going to local meditation group if you haven't already learned, or if you aren't able from a book.  This way, you can hone your awareness and ability to place that awareness on an object, and thereby observe more closely what is happening with these visions.  Most likely they will pass on their own, and aren't of any real consequence.   Fair enough...   What makes you think that it's true?  	104
 'That's a bold strategy cotton" "I don't know, I've seen boulder"   She's doing neither actually. Just acting completely normal.   Yeah I can tomorrow. It doesn't even look too bad the eye lid is just a bit red. Not even puffy really. Might it be possible she poked her eye with some hay? She does tend to toss it around and role in it... A lot... Lol   Will be worth noting that we opened a window and had a bunch of company the day prior. Maybe allergies?   My vape store will trade vented batteries for 50 off a new one, see if your will!   Hey, my rabbit is sick. One of her eyes is red and she's got a stuffy nose! She's still bouncing around and happy, eating (and tossing her bowl when she's done) with no sign of pain whatsoever. I'm thinking it may be a cold but I'm unsure. The vet literally won't do anything with her. Like that shouldn't even be a thing but he just keeps saying she's okay. The closest one is 3 miles away and I can walk that but the next one is 12 miles away. If it could be something serious I'll do it but she seems fine. Sometimes she'll close the eye but that's it. Any suggestions?   Is it the 18650 size or the 26650?   I'd have to say no on that...   Which mephisto? I've got an authentic mephisto RDA with a 26650 el diablo that work okay. Are the clones any good? I spent 100 on my RDA and for the price I'm disappointed.   When my girlfriend wants me to leave the vape store   With a 9 wrap parallel you'll get the same surface area as an 18 wrap with lower  though is the point I'm making I guess. But definitely if you can push more power through the coils you'll get comparable results.   Ohh okay I'm assuming you mean the box is series right? I only have unregulated mechanical boxes that are parallel so I don't actually have experience with controlling power levels.   What are the benefits of doing this instead of a 9 wrap parallel? Are you aiming for a longer ramp time? Not being sarcastic or anything I'm genuinely curious Lol   I believe so, I followed a tutorial online. This is the first real repair I've ever done to a car besides like breaks and stuff.   So what would you make of the smoke? If the pump is out I know it would leak but not at the back of the engine right?   I'm really hoping it was a miscommunication. I've had people tell me it wouldn't hold pressure with a blown head gasket, is that correct?   So that means replacing the water pump may do it?   Fill the back seat with bags of ice!   Edit: it is a 94 BMW 325i not a 328, not sure why the 8 is there.   Hello, I've been having some trouble with my BMW overheating. I bought this car because I wanted something nice to drive and also a car I could learn to work on. So today removed the radiator and the fan blades (?) To change the thermostat which went well but after reassembly when I turned it on and ran it for about 20 minutes it began over heating again! There is white smoke coming from under the left side of the engine which leads me to believe there could be a leaky head gasket but I noticed something rather peculiar. The hose to the right of the water pump was hot to the touch, but to the hose to left of it was much cooler (still hot, but not nearly as much). I took it to national tire and battery for a pressure check and they said it held 75lbs of pressure just fine. Any thought guys?    TLDR: 94 BMW 325i overheating, pressure check went well, small amount of white smoke coming from under engine on passenger side, changed thermostat and it didn't help.   He's one k away from racism      I've come to terms with it. How are they making the money to do this??? I've never seen something this overly advertised in my entire life!      What shop is this and where?      The whomping willow in its early years   Kinda depends if it's a double cheeseburger.  	27
 We only had one person speak, who shared a thoughtful prompt from another meeting. The prompt reminded us that this Earth is that of God's, therefore, we must be diligent in protecting the natural things we have been given; Earth is not ours to destroy.   The author describes his experience at a country jail, reflecting on the various individuals he met, and how American policies have affected the country.   I laughed pretty hard at this.   Right, but the reasoning they took to get there was far from orginalist (again, the quotes I used). Their thinking was flawed.   How is it an originalist argument? Again, Hughes used the case that emergencies required an expansion of government, something not found in the Constitution. Justice Black did the same thing when he mentioned in his opinion that war burdened us all, therefore holding up a "valid military order" (instead of making a presumption in favor of liberty, as the Framer's would have made) was justified.    It allowed the military to place Japanese in camps during WWII.  SCOTUS made the ruling it did on *Korematsu* because it stepped *away* from originalism. Here's what Chief Justice Hughes wrote in his opinion:  "Compulsory exclusion of large groups of citizens from their homes, except under circumstances of direct emergency and peril, is inconsistent with our basic governmental institutions...But when under conditions of modern warfare our shores are threatened by hostile forces, the power to protect must be commensurate with the threatened danger."  If that was true, the Framer's would have added an "emergency" clause somewhere in the Constitution (and they were fresh from being occupied by hostile forces themselves). Had SCOTUS kept to the ideas of the founders and been more strict with Constitutional meaning, *Korematsu* could not have been ruled as it did. If you can explain how this is not the case, I'll gladly listen.   Since I'm interested in politics, I read various non-fiction books about economics, history, and law. It's my main reading field.    The Autobiography of Malcolm X taught me the value in self-education, and getting a new perspective by traveling the world. His transition from preaching separatism of the races to believing that harmony could be achieved (after his visit to the racially diverse city of Mecca) taught me that whatever I believe now can change completely based upon a new experience.      Yes, I doubt the Democrats would want him as a nominee if he chose to run as a Dem. He's too off key with what their base supports.   However, I'd be curious to see if his running awakens some sort of socialist faction within the Democrats, similar to what Ron Paul did with libertarians in the Republican Party.      I somewhat discredit the 60s counterculture movement in regards to the topic at hand, the hippies weren't radical gun owners, per say.  No, but they were *massively* disobeying the law. Open drug use, protesting the DNC, rioting, avoiding the draft, numerous violent clashes with law enforcement (Kent State). We have nothing like that currently. Occupy and the Tea Party were steps in some sort of social shift, but Occupy failed to create a means to actually institute change, and the Tea Party fizzled out, becoming engulfed by the GOP. Unlike the various groups of the 60s (Black Panthers, SDS, etc.), neither Occupy or the Tea Party managed to last very long, prolonging the existence of the status quo.  Whatever you may think of the militia groups they a) don't have legislative influence and b) could easily be thwarted by the Feds, if needed (remember Waco?). And they've had plenty of opportunities to take on the Feds in an attempt to enact change (the Bundy standoff would have been a perfect moment to start a 'civil war').  Again, the KKK *literally* wrote laws in the last century (like with mandating students only attend public schools in Oregon, forbidding access to private shools and homeschooling). And do you remember what the second film to ever be shown at the White House was? (I'll give you a hint: Birth of a Nation.) As "ballsy" as these militias might be getting, at the very least, Congress isn't watching their films in some giant studio inside the Capital Building, or sitting next to them while legislation is written.  National and international tensions are pretty tight.  Can you name me a time, since the country's founding, when they *weren't* tight? Things were so bad in the past, we came several instances close to nuclear war (Cuban Missile Crisis/Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia). Currently, we're not at the point (though *conventional* war with Russia *could* be a possibility, depending on whether or not Putin decides to occupy a NATO country).   Not to mention, public approval for both president and congress are at all time lows. People understand that their government no longer serves their interests anymore.  People's approval of Congress is indeed low, but for their own Congressman, it's pretty normal. People blame the *other guy*, and not their own representative.   The point is, in context, things are indeed bad, a little bit better then they once were (what with the whole "separate but equal" thing gone), but still bad. People recognize this (Occupy and the Tea Party again being examples of people trying to distance themselves from the status quo), but we've yet to really get anywhere necessary in order for their to be massive change.  Many anarchists of course don't vote, but who gets how many votes in elections is still an important indicator of which direction our country wants to head in. Last election, Jill Stein, Gary Johnson, Virgil Goode, and other contenders for the presidency got *squat*. People are mad, like you said, but they're not doing anything different than what they have been for the past few decades.      But has there been civil unrest on the level that we see today? No.  Yes there has been. The events leading up to the American Revolution (and the Revolution itself) and the 1960s had actual riots and huge movements disobeying the law. People were massively avoiding taxes in the former, and fleeing the country (due to the draft) during the latter (and also avoiding taxes, in the case of Quakers and other religious pacifists). Then there was of course the Civil War, in which half of the country disobeyed the other half.  That's not to say there isn't an undercurrent of disobedience to the status quo (which is why figures like Bernie Sanders and Ron Paul are so popular), but, for the moment, it pales in comparison to previous social movements.  I agree a shift in social understanding of government is coming, but it will most likely be one in which government stays in place.  Edit: Also...  Coming from the right wingers here in the U.S. militias are expanding, and they're becoming more pronounced and are even flexing their existence on social media outlets and in public.  You forget the KKK had actual legislative influence in this country at one point.   I could understand that, but libertarian positions are so misunderstood and underrepresented in the political realm that if the movement is to gain any sort of traction then it needs someone who can convince people to completely change their way of thinking when it comes to the philosophy of government. At best, the majority of people who will vote for Johnson will do so because they *already* agree with him. That's not really enough to inspire a "Ross Perot/Ralph Nader" type moment where he could act as a spoiler in the election (or even possibly win).  I try to imagine him debating Obama in the presidential debates last election, and just can't see him winning.   But you are right - he doesn't pretend to be something he isn't, which is pretty nice for a politician.    I hope the LP chooses someone more articulate than him for President. I don't mind his positions, and agree with a fair portion, but he's not good at elaborating why libertarian policies would be the best thing for the country. I found his book *Seven Principals of Good Government* to be horribly dull, compared to the works of Ron Paul. And all of his speeches similarly lack real substance.  Good luck to him, but here's hoping someone better gets the spotlight.   The University of Delaware had the exact same program described in the article a couple years ago, and the exact same thing happened when minority students objected to being labeled "oppressed". They were told they were wrong, and that they were indeed "oppressed" even if they didn't feel like it.  It gets worse. At UoD, Resident Assistants asked for students to sexually identify themselves, and said request was *mandatory*. Here's an excerpt from FIRE President Greg Lukianoff's book Unlearning Liberty,  describing the program:   The program included an aggressive series of mandatory floor meetings where students would engage in exercises. In one such activity, they had to stand along a wall if they supported various social causes, including the right to gay marriage or abortion, and along the other wall if they didn't. Students were not allowed to say they hadn't made up their minds-it was explained to them that in the real world there is no middle ground. (I wonder how proponents of the "No Labels" movement would feel about that claim.) One student reportedly asked to be excused from the activity when the choice was whether eating disorders were caused by society or by the person's own mental state. Her request was denied; she was forced to pick a side even after revealing that she had struggled with an eating disorder and had not yet made up her mind. This event functioned as a state-sponsored public shaming of students with 'wrong' beliefs.    ...    The mandatory 'one on one' sessions with the RAs were, to me, the creepiest aspect of the whole program. During the sessions, students were asked to fill out surveys while an RA watched. Here is a sampling of some of the questions:    [2]. Would you be comfortable being close friends with any of the follow persons? Mark YES or NO    African American/Black... Y N    A heterosexual man... Y N    An international student... Y N    An openly gay or bisexual woman... Y N    [3]. Would you be comfortable dating any of the following persons? (Assume you are single)    Middle Eastern... Y N    A heterosexual woman... Y N    A person with different religious beliefs than yours... Y N    An openly gay or bisexual man... Y N    ...    In five hundred pages of documentation, there was only one clear example of a student who resisted these bizarre invasions of privacy. According to a report from her RA, this girl had fun with one of the questionnaires, answering the question "When was a time you felt oppressed?" by saying "I am oppressed every day [because of my] feelings for the opera. Regularly [people] throw stones at me and jeer me with cruel names...Unbearable adversity. But I will overcome, hear me, you rock throwing majority." The female freshman--apparently alone in her male RA's dorm room--had the guts to deflect such a creepy questionnaire through humor. But when the questionnaire asked "What is your sexual identity?" she responded, "That is none of your damn business."    For challenging an unlawful intrusion into her private life by a state employee, this student was listed by name and room number in the report as one of the "worst" examples of students resisting the program (yes it does start to sound a bit like the Borg), and the resident assistant even noted that he had filed an incident report against *her*. It would not surprise me if the student had been found guilty of harassing the RA.

It would not surprise me if the student had been found guilty of harassing the RA.    Various Presidents have packed the courts to support policy. There was the New Deal court, and then later on the Rehnquist court under Reagan. There are times when this works in the favor of these administrations, and times it works against. Judges are not often as predictable as we might think, and will rule outside the philosophy of their appointer on occasion.   That said, the Rehnquist court had several good rulings which resulted in favor of the people where government was in the wrong (*Texas v. Johnson*, for example). We should not be so quick to decry an originalist SCOTUS.    I believe I read it in Greg Lukianoff's *Unlearning Liberty*, where he mentions the rising college cost is due in part to the expansion of administrations.    It's best you start applying for jobs now. Check out Craigslist, Indeed, or your schools employment portal (which many have).   Even if management doesn't show respect, why does that mean we shouldn't try to be considerate? The reality is people have lives, and if you disrupt that, you can further ones poverty. Ultimately management is in control, but that doesn't mean we can't be responsible in the work place.   The problem is, what if no one serving in office currently has the requirements to serve on a committee? What if no one has a degree in civil engineering? Does that transportation and infrastructure committee then sit empty for a few years?   Some of my old coworkers had families, school, and and second jobs to attend. Sure, I can just be an individualist and just say I got mine, but that's not really treating your fellow workers with respect, nor is it caring for the poor (which matters to me).    No, as at my other job, my life is not at risk.    Martin O'malley is seriously looking to run.    But, like the author said, we don't really *know* who is running. We can make presumptions about her platforms, but that's all, due to her (purposeful?) quietness on issues. What's remarkable is that she has been in the spotlight ever since her husband took office, yet despite that, we don't have a clear image of her politics. One would think that over such a grand amount of time, a certain figure would begin to take shape, yet it hasn't, at least not to your average American voter.  Sure, we can presume she won't agree with the GOP on various issues, but even that doesn't tell us much about what she hopes to run on. Like the author said, her closeness to Wall St. is a little troubling, and could very well be a factor into what positions she holds as a contestant. Or maybe it won't. We'll have to see.    Afterwards, as a senator, Mrs Clinton made a habit of listening to, and working with, senators on both sides of the aisle, leading some Republicans publicly to regret having disliked her in the past.  Does anyone know who the author is referencing here?   Exactly. If I had quit my low wage job at the supermarket without two weeks notice, everyone else's schedules would have been crazy, and people probably would have would had to work hours they didnt sign up for. That really isnt fair.   If you ever make it up to Salt Lake City, you've got a free meal from me! Good luck!   On the second question, I would doubt he'd want to change anything in that field. For a lot of conservatives/libertarians, giving your money to whomever you wish, no matter the amount, is within your rights.    Deval Patrick, former governor of Massachusetts, could be a pick. He has some ties to the Obama administration.  He has a good career list, but nothing that stands out enough for him to warrant a Presidential nomination.    That's the key here. Theoretically, voters would have more say in the matter as it's easier to reach your Congressman than Obama. On top of that, if said war became unpopular and lasted until elections for Representatives, we could vote those who were in favor out.     I'd love to know his thoughts on financial aid for students, and whether it not that's a service the federal government should provide.    Currently reading *David's Hammer: The Case For An Activist Judiciary* by Clint Bolick. It has some interesting examples of how American courts are one of the only ways "the little guy" can challange "the big guy".   I thought this quote from Madison that Bolick gave was interesting:  "[the] smaller the society, the smaller number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression."   Although they're capitalist-libertarians, Students For Liberty has some activism kits on ending the drug war, ending war, and defending free speech both on campuses and the Internet: http://studentsforliberty.org/resources/  The Foundation for Individual Rights (FIRE) has publications on your legal rights in college: https://www.thefire.org/resources/  Liberty in North Korea gives great speeches at schools and is one of the best activist groups for aiding North Korean refugees. What's even cooler is their speeches are usually given by other college aged students who go around the country giving talks: http://www.libertyinnorthkorea.org/resources/  People Against the NDAA (PANDA) has an activist kit: http://pandaunite.org/resources/  All of this is assuming you're American :)    It worked with Desert Fox, as he said, which is true to a point. However, it's unknown if such a strike as that would work with Iran (with limited scope).    Wow. If that's true, that's quite the accomplishment. I can definitely see why it might have taken her so long.    Very good mention. In addition to what you've said, Atlas Shrugged is probably one of the (if not the) most read books today in regards to political fiction.    I've heard that the book may have not been as widely read during Hitler's time as we might think. It was given to people as gifts during Hitlers reign, but the receivers may have not actually read it.   The other thing is, it's a bad book, not because of it's contents (however terrible his ideas may be), but because of it's structure. Quite literally, you'll be reading a few passages on Hitlers youth in Austria, and all of the sudden a rant about the Jews comes up. It doesn't make a lot of sense.    I too am starting to get back into the habit of reading! Recently Egan taking the train to work which is about an hour and a half each way, so plenty of time to get some reading in :)  Good luck.    Bush. He proclaimed to be for state rights, but when Massachusetts legalized gay marriage, he wanted to create a federal law to prohibit said legalization. He wanted to do the same thing when Oregon made assisted suicide legal.    How funny, I was thinking of starting the same thing with almost the same name (Student Anarchists for a Stateless Society, or SASS).   I've done some student organizing before with a different student group, and would be willing to help out :)     Exactly. For my current job, a background check took about 3 days to complete. I'm assuming many states would be able to complete such a request in that same time frame.    My ideal process:  * Apply for permit * Wait 3-5 days while background check is processed  * Receive permit    I like the Cato Institute normally, but this made me chuckle.   The news networks will feature third party candidates occasionally (Fox hosted Gary Johnson a few times last election), but their time on the air is very brief, so you're right on the money.    Can I ask what good Warren has done from the Senate, from your perspective? So far everything I see by her are just speeches but little action, which makes me question her effectiveness and chances of electability (though she is definitely smart).    Mormons aren't that stupid. See this Economist article on their success in the business world: http://www.economist.com/node/21554173  BYU itself is a top rated school in a few fields (and is usually ranked first for accounting degrees). Plus, I wouldn't say they're insular, since many American LDS serve missions abroad in places like Brazil or Russia.   You could tell a capitalist to screw off (and write nothing else) here, and get upvotes. So it doesn't really have anything to do with that. But yea, silly comment.    Very good point. If video games do contain sexism, it mostly likely is a byproduct of the culture the designers live in.      Yes, he has a lot of work to do, especially with college students. His dad did amazing in that category, we'll see how Rand does.       They stopped temporarily, that was my mistake during the thread. I'm not sure if they're still doing it or not.     I didn't know about this, so I appreciate the posting. Also couldn't pick up any AnCap bias in the article.    I've seen the Google vans driving all over Provo recently. It's cool seeing them be so busy!    Like others have said, just politely decline. That said, as far as Mormons go, if you decline to talk to them, but new ones show up a little bit down the road, then that means the local missionaries have been switched out, and they might not be aware you've said no to them before. So keep that in mind.   That would be an impressive ticket. Not sure Walker is willing to be a VP though.   I asked two questions about the current status of the Beijing-Pyongyang relationship to the writers of The Diplomat during their /r/geopolitics AMA. Here's the correspondence:   *Q: Last year China stopped repatriating North Korean escapees. What does this signal, if anything, of the current relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang?*  /u/RobertFarley_AMA: There are plenty of indications that the relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang has grown tense in spots. The situation is complex; plenty of Chinese officials seem to feel some sense of obligation to North Korea, and there's a generalized sympathy with respect to shared anti-American and anti-Japanese attitudes. But North Korea also remains an expensive client for Beijing, with the potential to disrupt its emerging trade and political relationship with South Korea.   With respect to the escapees specifically, it's an administrative and economic pain to have to sort through the North Korean expat community in Manchuria and hunt down the ones that North Korea wants back. I'm actually not sure how much the Chinese have slowed this down; accounts seem to differ. But forced repatriation was certainly proving to be a growing embarrassment for Beijing, and perhaps one that the CCP wasn't willing to endure.  *Q: All of that being said, where do you see the China-North Korea relationship going in the next ten years?*  /u/ChenDingding_AMA: China, under president Xi Jinping, has already adopted a tough approach toward North Korea mainly because NK's behaviors are now hurting China's national interests. This trend will continue for the next ten years; but China will not allow NK to collapse.   http://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/30wxrf/we_are_writers_for_the_diplomats_flashpoints_blog/   In a sense, yes. I can believe gay marriage is wrong and still be a libertarian, so long as I believe that states/local communities should set the standards of what marriage is.   Ha, we don't. Our music is absolutely *terrible*, so the caller was a real trooper.    No, that doesn't apply. If you break certain codes within a theology, it disqualifies you from certain things, in the same vein that if I believe in ten different Gods, I can no longer call myself a Christian.    That's where the name comes from! Thanks!    I do tech support for an ISP. Got this call awesome call today:  Me: You've reached ISP tech support, how can I help you?  Bro: Holy shit, I was just on hold for 30 minutes  Me: Sorry to hear about that  Bro: No issue, I'm not mad, I don't even have a problem. I just wanted to tell you you're a beautiful person  lolwut  Me: Uh, thank you!  Bro: Yea, just ignore all those other jerks today. I was on hold for 30 minutes just to tell you that.  Me: I will, thanks man!  Bro: No problem, have the best day~ *click*  First time this has ever happened. And yes, it's going to be a good shift.   I think his biggest issue would be seperating himself from this current administration. Lots of people aren't satisifed with Obama, and would probably assume Biden wouldn't do much different than him. If he can somehow make himself look different (without tarnisihing the reputation of his former boss) then he might have a shot.   They may vote Republican, but that doesn't mean they agree with them on everything, similar to how a socialist or communist might vote for a Democrat, even though they disagree with who they're voting for.     Currently, yes that's true, but they are not the cause of a declining membership.    Reason Magazine, NPR, BBC, and the Washington Post.    Thanks for all that info. Didn't know that about Bush.    None, I think. It's a good read, so I can see why some normal person would want to share it with others. Is there a reason that can't be the case?     Some economists do argue that a lack of unionization has been a factor into income inequality. However, this drop in membership has been present before many states adopted right to work laws. The two don't seem correlated.    12% of Maryland's workforce is unionized according to Wikipedia. Are you saying that's the reason they have the highest median income? Sorry if I'm misunderstanding.   Plus, union membership has been going down all across the country for a while, right to work laws or not.    Yes, I've seen various subs attempt read groups, and they never seem to go anywhere after the first month. It is what it is.    Eyes are peeled! Good luck!   They go knowing about it, but that doesn't mean they agree with it. It's perfectly fine to advocate for a change of rules in your school - otherwise, how would progress be made?   Generally speaking this rise of cost is due to additions of administrations, not faculty. If you look at your local state school's payroll, you'll notice a difference in pay between admins and teachers, with one outweighing the other (generally).    For Harvard, many students don't need loans as the school is free if your family has an income below a certain amount. And for those that are above said amount, financial aid probably isn't possible due to their families high income.         It can't work like that. I could very well write in higher taxes on the rich because, for religious reasons, I believe in giving to the needy. There's no way you can stop things from influencing the reasons law makers make the laws they do.    I like your beards! Other than that, no comment.    Provo, Utah, checking in! Willing to grab a beer or two any weekend :)    Just left the GBA a few months ago. I miss Dunkins :(   All of that being said, where do you see the China-North Korea relationship going in the next ten years?   Last year China stopped repatriating North Korean escapees. What does this signal, if anything, of the current relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang?      http://youtu.be/sVx0NpYbtus  Perfect video going over what to and what not to do.    A lot of libertarian friends of mine are really saddened by this. They've all had their suspicions of him not being a true libertarian, but this seems to just confirm he's willing to back away from his father's view points.    Isn't the article more about sending market signals, rather than "telling us what to do"? I'd think those are two separate things.    A group of activists can gather in such a way that each member is a leader - it's not that hard to have a leaderless group where everyone is equal, playing their own part.    Just for reference, what about e-cigs? A lot of them only produce water vapor in lieu of smoke, which may or may not smell, but isn't generally harmful. And of course you don't throw them on the ground like a regular cig.    Forgive me, but I don't think this is correct, as colleges aren't holding criminal investigations (technically), but rather educational ones. A school is allowed to have different standards of evidence for this reason. For example, in a court, you must generally be charged without a reasonable doubt, but in a school investigation, they only need to be 51% sure you're guilty to reprimand you.     Boku No Pico is a yaoi (gay) anime. The yoooooooo thing is a reference to someone's reaction video to it:  http://youtu.be/Hdjv_afHmV4      Depending on what questions you answered and which ones you skipped, it doesn't seem like you belong with the GOP! Each question should have an explanation button if you're not sure about what it's asking - or just go and research on your own.    Go to http://www.isidewith.com, research and fill out the questions, and share your results! This will show you the stances of a few parties in the US.     EUIV and CIV are always fun, and their violence is pretty tame (no blood and guts, side you're moving units like they're chess pieces). Also, depending on the game, many Visual Novels (story games) are very fun. Visual Novels are like choose your own adventure games, ranging from adult themed, to horror, to (clean) romantic comedy.      There recently was a (rare) lawsuit regarding the third amendment, so apparently we still need it:  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/07/anthony-mitchell-lawsuit-third-amendment-_n_3557431.html   An answer from a previous thread sums it up:  I dunno man, you seem out of the loop in more ways than one. You know what dickbutt is, and I think you have as good an idea of its background as any of us (I assume it started as a 4chan thing, and it frequently appears as a visual reveal-punchline in GIFs. I'm not sure how much more there is to it.)  But why is it funny? I dunno, you could ask that question about any motif in the world like this that people tend to find humorous. It's funny cause it's unexpected, it's funny cause it's juvenile, it's funny in a "I should have seen that coming" kind of way.   But if it doesn't tickle you for any of the above reasons? Then you just don't find it funny. Case closed. It doesn't make you out of the loop. It just means you don't get it/it doesn't resonate with you, depending on your perspective.       Link to application?      If the GOP can get someone in the Whitehouse, and if they can maintain their control of Congress, they would probably act a lot differnetly than they are now, so we definitely have to wait to see what their next moves are.      Anarchist reporting in (specifically an anarcho-pacifist). You're asking why anarchism draws in communists and other state socialist types, yes? As in, why would a supporter of the Communist Party of [Country] turn towards anarchism?  Well, such people (communist and socialist statists) are all already against the hierarchy of capitalism (the boss vs. worker relationship). Many take logical steps to then say if one imposed hierarchy is bad, then so are others, namely, government and the imposition of law via violent means (police and courtS).  In fact, to many communists and Marxist academics, anarchy is the final form of communism. That is to say, a communist state should eventually dissolve itself into various anarchist communities.   As for the label of liberal, well, to many anarchists, any supporter of capitalism is actually a liberal (AnCaps excluded due to their different views).      No Scituate? Blashpemy. That would have been great.  "Skit-you-ate? Ski-tua-ate?"   I'm also a Bay Stater. Can confirm Massachusetts was not engulfed in flames after legalization of gay marriage.     Not sure on pricing, but Arizona State University offers an online BA for many degrees.    Can you at all sympathize with how your teachers behaved, given the context of the time (Columbine and 9/11)?    This is only my own experience, but last month after moving to SLC I was job hunting via KSL, Craigslist, and Utah Jobs. The good majority of jobs I found were call centers, blue caller work (like mechanics and the like), and a couple software jobs. And driving down a couple streets in places like Sandy, you can see a whole lot of "For Hire" signs at gas stations and fast food joints.   So just based on that month of job hunting, it doesn't really appear SLC has a diverse field in terms of places that are currently hiring.   I wonder what she would do about ISIS if they appeared after the death of McCain. My best is that she would take whatever advice generals gave her (which probably wouldn't be too different from what Obama gets today), but at the same time, I wonder if Republicans would be more open to having boots on the ground with a fellow conservative in the White House, and if so, how would she react?   My big concern would be her foreign policy towards Asia (specifically China). We've seen Obama and his administration organizing the Asia pivot, but I'm unsure if Palin would follow that same direction. Would she be more openly hostile towards Chinese military aggressions? Probably.  And if so, this would cause a lot of problems.   But like others have said, age would probably have a good cabinet set up by McCain to rely on.    It totally depends on how he worded this while in class, though. I wouldn't call this offensive, but if he said it the wrong way (accidentally or on not) I could see how other students might feel uncomfortable.    I think if you go into a local Salvation Army and explain the need for good interview clothing, they might give you a discount or the clothing for free if you do it right!         How does this open up exploitation? Voter fraud is already extremely rare: http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/voter-fraud-real-rare/story?id=17213376  Even if fraud increased, wouldn't the amount of it still be negligible?   	110
 Environmental factors cause an accumulation of reactive molecules known as Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), thus causing damage to the body's cellular structures. Antioxidants mediate the effects of ROS. Soybean flour increases the production of antioxidants.    Thanks! This will be useful for a few people.    Here's the full article in PDF http://libgen.org/scimag/index.php?s=10.1016/j.mce.2015.03.024  This is from someone on /r/AdvancedFitness  I personally have access to the article through other means.    Summary of the findings:  - Baseline casein versus baseline soy: increased superoxide dismutase 1, catalase and glutathione reductase activities,   - Baseline casein versus baseline soy: increased total glutathione and reduced glutathione content, and decreased oxidized glutathione content   - All the results were more significant from baseline in the normocaloric diet group  - In conclusion, soybean flour mediates Reactive Oxygen Species-induced intracellular damage in nucleic acids, lipids, proteins and hydrocarbons    I don't think OP realizes the immense complexity of the question (s)he is asking. Whether senescence can actually be reserved or slowed down via changes in gene expression patterns is the subject of ongoing research. Even a biomedical gerontologist wouldn't be able to fully answer.    Well, at the very least, it suggests that not all amino acids are equal, which I'm pretty sure is an already well established fact.          Nope, not at all, but whatever happened in the past is irrelevant - the games they're playing right now represent the peak of their teamfighting ability in its current state, it'd just easy to see how they're on a whole other level. Their abilities to initiate, to coordinate both initiating abilities and in general, and their positioning are all on point.       This is one of the best play I have ever seen in 6 years. Perhaps on the same level as Faker's Zed play. There are no words to describe how insane that was.    No, you need to be at a caloric surplus in order to increase muscular mass, unless you're using an anabolic steroid of course.    Mere anecdotal evidence, and irrelevant to the subject at hand.    Quote from someone on /r/science:  'Having said all that, what you said is most likely correct - dairy protein is likely more beneficial for muscle growth compared to meat. The main reason is that digesting meat takes time and rapid increases in amino acids seem to be better at maximising muscle growth and protein synthesis rates both at rest and following exercise. A couple of papers to support what I said, minced beef is more rapidly digested than steak (increased surface area for stomach enzymes to breakdown when it's minced). Protein retention is increased but not protein synthesis at 6 hrs  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23636241  Whey hydroslate, which is more rapidly absorbed than casein, increases protein synthesis to a greater degree and max protein synthesis occurs within 90mins of ingestion  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19589961  I don't know of a direct dairy vs meat comparison in muscle (there most likely is one) but most of the data suggest a rapid increases in amino acids results in greater mTOR activation and thus protein synthesis and potentially muscle mass. Dairy would likely be the better option due to it being digested more rapidly.'   Thanks for your input! Very well said.    Not specified, but all studies discussed obviously found a significant increase from baseline relatively to CTL group.    Fair enough. I agree that the title I chose is too opportunistic. I apologize.    Yes, but Ilgf-1 is known to regulate muscle growth via the Ilgf-1-protein kinase B pathway, so IMO it's not too far-stretched to infer that these findings are related to muscle growth.

Not from Australia, but if you are in an industrialized country, the best method to get AAS is through your doctor, whether legally or not, because then you are assured it will be human grade.  Otherwise, many companies ship internationally, but the question is: will it get through the customs? I am in Canada, and sometimes, even my research chemicals that were for pharmaceutical purposes in non-human subjects were refused. When I was in a non-aligned country this wasn't a problem.        People are ignorant. I wouldn't listen to what anyone tells you unless you know for sure that they know what they're saying.    The 'weird generic medical cough drop type taste' as you describe it could have different causes. It could simply be that a small quantity of Trenbolone got into a lymph vessel upon injection.   Or it could be due to the fact that Tren causes a significant rise in prostaglandins, lipid compounds that act like hormones in mammals. Prostaglandins are synthesized by two enzymes, one of which is known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase, and which is responsible for constriction of vascular smooth muscle tissue amongst other things. This is what generally causes what people colloquially refer to as the 'tren cough'.  In research subjects that I've observed, this was more likely to happen when the compound was not of pharmaceutical grade, and when a Benzyl benzoate ester was used. This is only anecdotal evidence, however.    Those indigenous people they refer to are, in fact, modern humans.    They have no reason to go out of their way to go into detail about something that is common knowledge for most people who will read their paper.       No. It is a well established fact that humans can rely entirely on dietary fats to produce ATP.    Simply put, a 2mg/kg injection of Testosterone has cardio-protective effects in Testosterone-deprived subjects.             Probably mostly China.    I think being old and a bodybuilder is awesome, because no one looks down on old people for using steroids and growth hormone. It's seen as anti-aging measures and most people by that age have lost all their hair if they were genetically predisposed to and don't have sex anymore so having shrinked balls is no biggie.          Thank you for your time. Clearly you have more insight into this article at looked at it more into depth than I did. Nothing to disagree with. Thank you again!   There is no difference between egg- and whey-based protein in respect to anabolic response, insulin sensitivity, fat breakdown and satiety response.    This study is about proteins, not monosaccharide and disaccharide sugars. Not sure what your point is.    This study is really interesting to me for two reasons:  -Based on previous findings, the researchers had predicted that whey protein would be better at facilitating an increase in muscle mass and a decrease in fat, but this wasn't the case;  -Also based on previous findings, they had predicted that both types would cause a similar increase in satiety-related hypothalamic markers, and they were both correct and wrong: correct because there was a similar increase in both types, but wrong because neither was significant (as you can see [here](http://www.jissn.com/content/12/1/14/figure/F6)), suggesting that protein in general is not effective at initiating a satiety response.         In short, the research on Lactate-Caffeine has found that it:  -Increases myoblast cell hypertrophy, prevents muscular denervation atrophy, and might also improve bone, liver and brain health via activation of calcineurin-NFAT signalling (1);  -Promotes muscular protein biosynthesis and adipose tissue breakdown by increasing myogenin and follistatin protein levels and phosphorylation of P70S6K while decreasing the levels of myostatin (2).  **References**  1.

I'm not too sure what 75g of lactate would do to the body, besides boosting muscular hypertrophy. But an excellent source of lactate is baking soda. Examine.com has about 40 studies which show that baking soda increases lactate production.    Of course the term 'healthy' makes sense when used by medical professionals who know what they are talking about. I just think it creates unnecessary confusion and fosters ignorance amongst laypeople, that's all.    I don't think you understand what I'm saying at all. It is believed that eating behaviors are influenced by two neural pathways: the homeostatic and the hedonic (reward) pathways. The homeostatic pathway is basically what says 'you need to eat or else you will die', whereas the hedonic pathway is what says 'I really want to eat this bag of chips in this very moment', a phenomenon colloquially referred to as food cravings. It is also believed that metabolically abnormal people (such as the overweight   obese) are literally either less capable or completely incapable, physiologically speaking, of controlling these 'cravings', partly due to genetic factors that influence the relationship between these pathways and appetite- and hunger-related hormones that regulate them.    With all due respect, I disagree. I think that we need to ditch this overly vague entirely term and use appropriate, more specific denominations instead. For example, you can say 'low GL foods provide a more consistent supply of energy', or 'micro nutrients are necessary for the functioning of vital processes'. 'Healthy' implies that certain foods or food combinations, due to their nutrient breakdown, are superior, which is utterly false, as no nutrient is harmful to the body on its own. Furthermore, current understanding of biochemical principles merely states that you need amino acids, micro nutrients, some fat, and a supply of either carbohydrates or fats in order to produce Adenonine triphosphate through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. It also states that a positive energy balance will lead to an increase in adipose tissue storage and other metabolic abnormalities, and that some nutrients (such as sodium), when consumed in large quantities over extended periods of time, might be harmful. But that's it. Everything else stretches beyond this current understand, and using the word 'healthy' tends to do just that, in my opinion.    That's literally exactly what I said.    No. The core issue runs deeper than that. What we need is to teach people the basic biochemical principles behind nutrition, such as the energy balance one. Also, more importantly, we need to get rid of this entire culture of 'eating being an enjoyable activity' or a 'reward', and we need to teach people that it is something that we should do primarily for basic survival purposes. If you add to that ridiculous cultural ideal the genetic predispositions in hormone production patterns and reward pathway signalling, you get people who become physiologically incapable of making the difference between eating because they need to and eating because they 'feel like it'. Yes, foods are supposed to be rewarding to eat for evolutionary reasons, but not to the point where it makes people overweight, and I believe this is essentially our modern society's fault, as it is consistently over-emphasizing the very behavior of eating as 'nice and rewarding' for economical purposes.    There is no such thing as eating 'healthy'. I hate this term because it is very vague, and people have their own understanding of what it means to 'eat healthy', and that understanding tends to be extremely flawed. In in vitro experiments, ending the day with an even or negative energy balance far outweighs all other factors for general health in the long run, including macro and nutrient choices. Furthermore, like I've said elsewhere in this thread, there is little evidence that different nutrients will initiate a significantly different satiety response.   Of course nutrient choices have an impact. For example, eating foods with a low Glycemic Load equips the body with a more consistent, longer-term supply of energy, and it is essential to eat a certain amount of proteins, fats and micro nutrients, for the proper functioning of physiological processes that relate to basic bodily functions, such as tissue maintenance and growth.   But nutrient choices aren't what causes obesity. People not knowing how many calories they're actually eating, and not making the difference between eating to maintain body homeostatis and eating to reward themselves or as a conditioned response to environmental factors (such as stress, boredom, anxiety, etc.) is much, much more likely to be the cause of obesity.    Exercising does not make you lose weight. Eating less calories than your body needs makes you lose weight. Exercising makes it easier to end the day with a negative caloric balance, for obvious reasons, but if despite exercising you still end the day with a positive balance, then that exercising will not make you lose weight, it's as simple as that.   This article is very ignorant if you ask me. There isn't a great deal evidence that any nutrient, or  that any type of monosaccharide sugar in particular, has an impact on the satiety response, although there is some evidence that certain sugars (such as fructose) might affect the brain's hedonic pathway in particular ways that contribute to overeating.  The most recent research is pointing towards genetic differences amongst individuals in the complex relationship between the homeostatic and non-homeostatic (hedonic) neural pathways, various hormones (leptin, grehlin, PYY, etc.) and environmental factors (such as stress and anxiety) as one of the underlying causes of metabolic abnormalities such as obesity and dysglycemia.  There is also some evidence that gut microbiota plays a role in overeating through the gut-brain neural axis. But to say that you should just eat 'less sugar and carbs' is very ignorant. It's way, way more complicated than that. Most people don't even how many calories they're eating.      According to [Examine.com](http://examine.com/supplements/Sodium+Bicarbonate/), 'supplemental dosages of sodium bicarbonate are in the 200-300 mg/kg range when used before exercise. Although 500 mg/kg is slightly more effective, it tends to be associated with a higher degree of intestinal side effects if taken all at once.'  Also, there is a total of 37 studies which have found that consumption of baking soda increases lactate production. You can also find these on Examine.com.   This study is really interesting to me for two reasons:  -Based on previous findings, the researchers had predicted that whey protein would be better at facilitating an increase in muscle mass and a decrease in fat, but this wasn't the case;  -Also based on previous findings, they had predicted that both types would cause a similar increase in satiety-related hypothalamic markers, and they were both correct and wrong: correct because there was a similar increase in both types, but wrong because neither was significant (as you can see [here](http://www.jissn.com/content/12/1/14/figure/F6)), suggesting that protein in general is not effective at initiating a satiety response beyond the regular calorie consumption response threshold.  If these findings can be replicated, it would be a huge blow to supplement companies, which like to claim that whey protein is overall superior to that from regular food and that it 'fills you up', the latter which clearly couldn't be farther from the truth.   Seems like it's time to move away from whey protein supplementation.       Nice! Solid work man! Don't stop! Even greater gains await!    Because not lifting makes you average, and I'd hate that.    I would recommend baking soda. It increases the production of lactate as shown in various studies. Something like 500mg/kg of bodyweight per day in 3 doses with a cup of coffee each (not verified).    She probably had Nandrolone or Testosterone prescribed to her in small doses. Recent studies show that androgenic hormones help protect against paralysis-induced muscular atrophy.    No, but in my humble opinion, something that could be used, until a Lactate-Caffeine solution is available on the market, is baking soda. Studies show that baking soda increases the production of lactate. Something like 15g of baking soda with a regular size cup of coffee three times a day (not verified).    Send me a PM to read the full paper.    The conclusion summarizes the findings fairly well:  In conclusion, we found for the first time that treatment with LC compound increases satellite cell activity and anabolic signals in C2C12 cells. Furthermore, low-intensity exercise with LC compound increases muscle mass, satellite cell activity, and anabolic signals. These results suggest that administration of LC compound could effectively increase muscle mass concomitant with elevated myonuclei, even with low-intensity exercise, by means of activated satellite cells and anabolic signals in skeletal muscle. Therefore, the study of LC compound should provide insight into the development of strategies against muscle wasting and loss of function associated with a wide range of neuromuscular diseases such as sarcopenia.      Sadly, there is no LC compound available on the market yet.    In one particular study, it was found that anabolic steroids such as Testosterone and 19-nortestosterone increase Calcineurin-NFAT signalling, the process by which the protein phosphatase Calcineurin removes the phosphate group from the DNA-binding protein Nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) via hydrolysis, leading to an increase in myoblast cell hypertrophy and a reduction in muscular denervation atrophy, the process by which muscle fibers become shrinked when the nerve to the muscle is severed (1).  In another study, it was found that a lactate-caffeine compound activates 'intracellular calcium signals', which, in turn, also activates calcineurin signalling. It also increases the production of Myogenic factor 4 and Follistatin, and, concurrently, reduces the production of Growth Differentiation Factor 8, also known as Myostatin, and which is known for limiting protein biosynthesis in mammals (2).   So, in other words, increasing lactate-caffeine supplementation leads to an increase in muscular hypertrophy via an increase in Calcineurin-NFAT signalling and in the production of various proteins.    **References**  1. *Anabolic steroids activate calcineurinNFAT signaling and thereby increase myotube size and reduce denervation atrophy.* Weiping Qin, Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology 399 (2015) 336345.  2. *Mixed lactate and caffeine compound increases satellite cell activity and anabolic signals for muscle hypertrophy.* Yoshimi Oishi, Journal of Applied Physiology.

Well, to put it in more specific terms, my understanding is there are two neural pathways that are influenced by various hormones (ghrelin, leptin, PYY, etc) as well as by environmental factors: the homeostatic and the hedonic (or non-homeostatic) pathways. The homeostatic pathway is what tells you 'eat or you will die', it maintains, just as it says, homeostasis in the body. On the other hand, the hedonic pathway is what tells you 'I really want to eat this cake right now', it dictates what people colloquially refer to as 'food cravings'. I think it's possible, like I said, that genetic variations in individuals and which relate to these pathways and environmental factors could be the real underlying cause of obesity.    Thank you, this is some serious inspiration. Every time I think of having a cheat meal, of skipping a workout, of skipping an hour of sleep to do something else... I think of these people and it drives me to not fall to temptation. I was born healthy and with a problem-less life, and I know this makes me one of the lucky ones, and I know that I have no right to complain or not follow what I know to be the best course of action, when there are people like this girl who are giving it their very best.    I've read some research on how the gut bacteria can hijack the gut-brain pathway and affect nutrient choices, but I'd be careful with sweeping generalizations. This is complex.    Well, again, it's a complex subject that I don't fully understand. But by 'actually having to eat', I mean, in layman's terms, knowing that you have to eat a certain number of calories throughout your day in order to reach your target caloric intake (which I believe has to do with the body's homeostatic pathway). And 'being hungry' refers to the complex relationship between the body's reward systems (such as the hedonic pathway), and various hormones, specifically ghrelin and leptin. My basic assumption is that different nutrients affect all these things differently, which in turn affects, again in layman's terms, whether people feel the need to ingest certain foods or not.    Yes of course, sugar is not actually toxic. But my basic reasoning is that sugar as found in fruits and vegetables is satiating and promotes not being on a caloric surplus and general health because it's rich in dietary fibers, rich in micro nutrients and not very caloric. On the other hand, sugar as found in processed sugar foods promotes being on a caloric surplus because it's either low in or devoid of dietary fibers and also packed with fats, which, although not inherently bad of course, are very caloric by nature. They're also either low in or devoid of micro nutrients as well. Sure, caloric intake is what mostly matters, but what I've noticed from working with obese people trying to lose weight is that when they eat a lot of sugar rich products, they have more difficulty controlling their hunger and, since most people don't count calories and don't understand the difference between being hungry and having to eat (otherwise they wouldn't suffer from obesity in the first place), it causes them to end up being at a caloric surplus more often. Does that make sense?     To be honest, I haven't looked into the why's of what makes his theories wrong so I won't elaborate on that. But don't you agree though? That sugar in its highly processed form as found in soft drinks, candy bars, etc., is part of the reason why there has been such a huge increase in metabolic diseases? It's always been my assumption but I'm just a first year Biochem student so I don't want to pretend like my understand of the subject is advanced enough to come to such conclusions.    Care to elaborate on why 'Lustig is full of shit'? A lot of people say that, but I've never understood why. His argument that people come to a point where they are incapable of making the difference between being hungry and actually needing to eat due to hormone imbalances caused by diet is a pretty sound one, IMO. He basically says that people's diet is making them eat more than they need.    Ok, I take back what I said. Most fruits and vegetables are not very energy dense, mainly because they're rich in dietary fibers. However, in nature, fruits and vegetables are still where sugar is mostly found; these, with a few exceptions, have a low to intermediate  impact on blood sugar level, are not very caloric, and are packed with micro nutrients. My theory is that one of the reasons why humans evolved to like sugar so much is because sugar foods were ancestrally associated with things that humans want to eat in order to survive, such as fruits and vegetables as aforementioned. But when you remove the fibers, remove the micro nutrients, combine the sugar with high amounts of dietary fat, and modify the glucose/fructose ratio in favor of the latter to make it more addictive ([as fructose stimulates the dopamine pathways more so than other monosaccharide sugars do](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/attachments/639_Sucrose%20and%20fructose%20-%20Is%20sugar%20really%20like%20cocaine_Prof%20Macdonald.pdf)), it becomes something entirely different.   Also, more evidence that fructose is more harmful than other monosaccharides [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20800122), [here](http://advances.nutrition.org/content/4/2/236.full.pdf+html) and [here](https://books.google.ca/books?id=mfy6BAAAQBAJ pg=PA350 lpg=PA350 dq=fructose+hedonic+pathway source=bl ots=1-LhyFIxjl sig=yLJayvVRHHA-9XkGbvRe8nZ5JLA hl=en sa=X ei=G0I3VdbpIKTIsATk5oDQAQ ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage q=fructose%20hedonic%20pathway f=false).         Thanks for the amazing schooling sir, this was really informative!   Maybe, maybe not. Would more people kill themselves from DNP overuse like this girl if DNP was legal? I don't know, this is a complex question to answer.    Actually, alcohol is different. Alcohol is poisonous altogether, even in small doses. To alter my own mind, I would much rather ingest THC or psilocybin, or even inject myself with some phenethylamine compound, than use a carcinogen that disrupts the synthesis of tissue-building hormones and increases fat storage by slowing down metabolism.    This is anything but surprising. Previous research has found that fructose triggers the brain's hedonic pathway but not its satiety mechanisms, leading to something that nutritionists colloquially refer to as the 'sugar-craving cycle'. This is why fructose rich food products (soft drinks, candy, ice cream, chocolate bars, etc.) sell so well.   From an evolutionary perspective, sugar-rich foods used to be scarcely found in nature and associated with a high degree of energy density (for example, in fruits), and therefore our ancestors evolved to find them extremely rewarding to eat. But what happens  when foods that are extremely rewarding to eat are no longer scarce and energy dense? The result is obesity, dysglycemia   other metabolic diseases.   This is essentially an evolutionary mismatch between ancestral adaptations to environment and the industrialization of society, and it has turned the food market into the business of slowly killing people.          Never go full retard... The side effect of DNP overuse is: an acute risk of death. This is a well established fact by now. However, when used intelligently, is it as dangerous as the media is going to claim with this case? Hell no. But a lot of society is incredibly ignorant and for that reason alone DNP should remain out of reach.    This has already been posted both here and on the AdvancedFitness subreddit, actually.  Overall I would say it's nothing new. You will grow similarly in the short run no matter the weight/number of reps, but in the long run, a heavier load will allow for better linear progression when it comes to weight lifting. However, lifting too heavy also has its downsides, and it's why the 8-12 rep range is probably the best one... It allows you to go heavy enough to see a good progression, but not so heavy that your injury risk is significantly higher than if you were using much lighter loads.   In all cases, thank you for posting this still - reiteration of already well established observations in science is never a bad thing.    If there's one thing you sure as hell don't want to get bigger, it's your heart. Heart hypertrophy is deadly.    If I remember correctly, none of the rats actually died during the experiment. But their heart muscle grew insanely large and they probably died shortly afterwards.    It was found to have long-term toxic effects on the heart of rats at really high doses. The rats were fed multiple grams. In comparison, illicit use is rarely reported to be higher than 170 micro grams in humans.    To summarize the article: they looked at three mRNA encoding genes: Krppel-like zinc finger transcription factor 5 (KLF-5), zinc finger protein 423 (ZFP423) and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG). KLF-5 and ZFP423 are involved in adipogenesis, the process by which cell differentiation causes preadipocytes to become mature adipocytes. PPARG is involved in fatty acid synthesis, the process by which acetyl coA is converted to fatty acids. Expression rate of KLF-5 and ZFP423 was lower in clenbuterol-injected group than in control group. Expression rate of PPARG was lower in abdominal fat tissue.

Saying that it merely disrupts the metabolic process for storing fat is pretty vague.                I'm pretty sure Fnatic will get shit on. We will see though.    I have confidence that Hai can get his shit together and improve as a player. This is Cloud9 we're talking about after all.       Some people are saying that it can last up to 36 hours. Not sure to what extent this is true, but this is freaking long lasting for a stimulant.    Whoa, lots of great info. Not sure how I missed that. In all cases, thank you!   Anyone has info/experience on this drug? I have access to a supply of it, but would like to gather some information on it beforehand. Google has been failing me here, I have a lot of research material on it, but no anecdotal evidence/experience reports from users.    Burden of proof is on you. No where in your link is there any evidence that explicitly states the emphasis/importance of breast size.    Do you have evidence that breast size is actually a judging criterion? Or is this just your assumption?    All such comps are, in theory at least, subject to the same criteria as most other fitness/bodybuilding competitions - conditioning, symmetry, posing routine, etc.       It refers to Site Enhancement Oils - colloquially known as Synthol.    Thanks for the constructive criticism! Much appreciated! Replacing the bedrock would also make it survival friendly, I just realized that too. :P    I do not blame them for lying. A lot of society is ignorant and not ready for the truth about physical appearance. Achieving an amazing body is extremely hard, and is done with a combination of hard work and the use of various drugs and other body enhancement methods. Anyone who believes otherwise is part of the masses that are being lied to on the daily.    Well, my understanding is that, for a lot of girls, having breasts of at least a certain size is important for self esteem and finding oneself attractive. And for most girls it's impossible to maintain that certain size and get down to the required low body fat percentage at the same time. That's why a lot of girls who compete in bikini fitness end up getting breast implants.   So what? Are you implying that getting breast implants is a bad thing? It's pretty much the same thing as male bodybuilders using SEOs in the off season or Formebolone during comp prep - when done correctly, it does look nice.       Thanks!   Amazing! Where can I get one?       Before English was the language of business, it was French (when Europe dominated the world, pre-WW2), and before that, it was Latin. So, from this perspective, the three most important languages in recent world history are English, French and Latin.             Inhibiting production of serotonin in the digestive system causes the activation of a protein in the adipose tissue cells that dissipates the energy produced as heat.    Whoa.         Possibly, but from what I've read the side effects on internal organs can take quite a few years to manifest themselves.    He was made for this, literally.    Mirin'    Do you have pics of his legs as well?    It's the interaction between hGH, IGF-1 and Insulin that does that, most likely. Not hGH alone.    Holy crap. Ronnie Coleman before he hopped onto the hGH-IGF-1 bandwagon. The best there might ever be. Unbelievable.    Long story short, high GL foods should only be consumed post-workout due to the post-exercise insulin sensitivity effect. Outside of that, high GL foods should be avoided, especially if you're trying to cut down on body fat.    A lot of people who use DNP forget the importance of eating carbohydrates to maximize the effect of that compound. In order for the citric acid cycle (the main metabolic pathway) to take place, you need glucose. Glucose is broken down into pyruvate, which will not only start the chain reaction that leads to the cycle itself, but will also allow fatty acids to be processed as energy more effectively; carboxylate is removed from pyruvate to form acetyl co-enzyme A, to which the 2-carbon molecule oxaoloacetate is added to form citric acid. However, fats (in the form of acetate) need to bind ocaoloacetate,  which comes from pyruvate as well. This is because it's also acetyl coA that is converted through fatty acids, which are then synthesized through ketosis to form acetyl coA, and to which oxaoloacetate is then binded to form citric acid. What does this mean? When using DNP, glucose is used at a incredibly higher than usual rate. This is because the proton gradient, that results from the electron transport chain caused by the oxidations of the citric acid cycle, is dissipated as heat instead of being used as energy. Therefore, your body will constantly try to produce more energy to make up for that. And how is energy produced? With pyruvate, like I said earlier. I know this is a bit complicated, but the takeaway is: increase your carbohydrate intake. If I was using DNP, I would probably increase my carb intake to 60% of caloric intake. I don't think you can easily eat too much carbs when taking DNP.    Layne Norton says that refeed days should happen every day 6-12 days, and increasingly more often the longer you've been cutting. He also says that refeed days should either be at maintenance caloric intake or slightly above. But it's not based on any research, just his personal opinion, as far as I know. I haven't found any research. All I know is that when you go above caloric maintenance, fats and carbs do not get along anymore (due to the impact of insulin on fat storage), so you gotta be even more careful about your macro nutrient breakdown.    A lot of people say that having cheat meals, or cheat days, or 'taking a break from dieting', is actually a good thing. No one can disagree on the obvious psychological relief it provides to people who see the diet necessary to achieve their goal body as painfully strict. But beyond that, a lot of people seem to believe that it's also actually good physiologically speaking, that it 'allows your body to 'reset' and become more effective at burning fat afterwards' or other discourses of the kind. **My goal with this post is to shatter those beliefs into pieces, and show you that, in an ideal world, you should indeed be on what many people call a 'strict diet' all year long.**  First, I believe those beliefs on cheat meals/days to have originated from the research on leptin, a complex and not-yet-fully-understood adipose tissue hormone that regulates appetite and metabolic efficiency (1)(2)(3). It mainly does so due to its interactions with the endocannabinoids, Tetrahydrocannabinol-like neurotransmitters that are naturally occurring in the brain and of which one of the main roles is to to increase appetite and slow down metabolism (4). Simply put, leptin counters the effects of these neurotransmitters, thus leading to a reduction in appetite and an increase in metabolic efficiency (5). But that's not all. Leptin has an antagonistic relationship with another hormone, ghrelin, of which the main goal is to stimulate appetite; the less you eat, the lower your production of leptin is, and, inversely, the higher your production of ghrelin is (6). Also, leptin has been shown to regulate the production of certain uncoupling proteins in fat cells, the role of these uncoupling proteins being to regulate body weight through thermogenesis (7)(8). In fact, in other studies, a significant correlation between activation of the uncoupling proteins in adipose tissue and weight loss was found, showing that uncoupling protein-induced thermogenesis does indeed play a role in regulating body weight (9).   Now, what does this have to do with cheat meals? Well, a lot of the original research on leptin came to three conclusions:  1) Morbidly obese people have reduced leptin sensivity  2) Leptin production seems to decrease and increase along with caloric intake  3) Leptin production affects metabolism and appetite  The two latter conclusions were, as usual, widely misunderstood by fitness enthusiasts, and, for the following decades, people would have a discourse along the lines of 'cheating is actually important because it refreshes leptin production' as a result.   To make it clear, the research found no such thing. What the research found is that, complex carbohydrates (starches, or low Glycemic Load carbohydrate foods), and, to a lesser extent, proteins as well, affect leptin production, but fats and sugars **do not** (10)(11)(12)(13).   In light of this evidence, cheat days, of which the purpose is to refresh leptin production, or, as they're sometimes called, 'refeed days', should be **high complex carbohydrate, moderate protein, low fat and low sugar days.** Fat intake should be limited to healthy fats, such as omega-3, and high Glycemic Load foods should never be consumed besides after your workout, to take full advantage of the post-exercise insulin sensivity effect. In other words, it should be something like 50% complex carbohydrates, 35% proteins, 10% fats and 5% sugar. And guess what? This is what your diet should look like all year round, except with maybe slightly less carbohydrates, and slightly more proteins and fats.   People need to understand... there is no such thing as a 'strict diet'. What you call a 'strict diet' is what your diet should be almost all of the time. From an evolutionary perspective, the human brain was not conceived to have access to an unlimited supply of foods that are rich in sugar and sodium. In the time of our ancestors, such foods were usually scarce and associated with a high level of energy density, and therefore they had to be extremely rewarding to eat. But what happens when foods that are extremely rewarding to eat are no longer scarce and energy dense? Well, you get the society of today. You get fat people who think it's okay to be fat out of ignorance, who reward themselves on the daily with 'fast foods' and sugar rich products, not realizing the fate to which they're condemning themselves... You get a society that is getting increasingly life-threateningly obese.   The goal of this post was to prove that, beyond the 'psychological relief effect' caused by an evolutionary mismatch between ancestral adaptations to environment and modern socio-economic changes, there is no reason to have 'cheat meals/days', and I think that, in this regard, it did its job.   **References**  1. http://www.pnas.org/content/94/9/4242.full?ijkey=5c2c5772d740862e07e613dff21bcbacb97d1e8d keytype2=tf_ipsecsha  2. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7984236?dopt=Abstract  3. http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v385/n6612/abs/385119a0.html  4. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16787229  5. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11298451  6. http://www.precisionnutrition.com/leptin-ghrelin-weight-loss  7. http://www.jbc.org/content/272/39/24129.full  8. http://www.jbc.org/content/272/39/24129.full  9. http://my.pingabox.com/shared/f.html?f=bygaik  10. http://ajpendo.physiology.org/content/277/5/E855.long  11. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11126336  12. http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/82/1/41.abstract  13. http://www.briancalkins.com/simplevscomplexcarb.htm        There are two main places in the body where serotonin is found to have an important role: the central nervous system and the digestive system. The study looks at the effects of serotonin in the digestive system, it doesn't look at drugs such as alcohol and weed, which are believed to mainly affect the serotonin mechanisms in the central nervous system.    I would love to see that. Levrone is one of the all time greats.    Just to clarify, peripheral serotonin synthesis refers to the action of serotonin in the gastrointestinal tract, not in the central nervous system. Mind-altering drugs usually affect the latter, so this has nothing to do with alcohol or THC or any other drug of the type.       From the article:  '...genetic or chemical inhibition of Tph1 (an enzyme that synthesizes serotonin) protects or reserves the development of HFD(high fat diet)-induced obesity and dysglycemia via activation of UCP1 (thermogenin, an uncoupling protein in adipose tissue that dissipates energy as heat)-mediated thermogenesis.'      From the article:  '...genetic or chemical inhibition of Tph1 (an enzyme that synthesizes serotonin) protects or reserves the development of HFD(high fat diet)-induced obesity and dysglycemia via activation of UCP1 (thermogenin, an uncoupling protein in adipose tissue that dissipates energy as heat)-mediated thermogenesis.'  Basically, this means that higher levels of serotonin reduce the functionality of fat cells, thus reducing the body's ability to use fat in order to produce energy.       Wow he looks fat! That bulking phase!   Really interesting. Thanks for sharing!   That's the thing, you can't. Even if you managed to get some actual Follistatin (the name of the antagonist) and a modified adenovirus, you still wouldn't have the right thing, because Follistatin targets the entire TGF- superfamily, and the compound they used in the clinical trial is an isoform of Follistatin, a similar version that has been modified to target only the myostatin pathway. There is no way to get this compound, as it was produced in limited supply solely for the series of clinical trials that they're running.    Ignorance is bliss.       Indeed. Human genetic engineering is no longer a thing of the future. Research to turn adeno-associated viruses into viral vectors that can precisely deliver new DNA into cells is currently underway. In a couple years from now, athletes will be able to use these modified viruses to boost their genetic potential way beyond what is currently possible even for the most genetically gifted. And what's amazing is that there no way to detect gene doping, because there is currently no way of detecting changes in protein expression, for obvious reasons (the human genome is an unbelievably complex entity).   But the luckiest ones of us are the ones who aren't born yet; in the future, rich future parents will be able to pay to have the cells in the genes of the blastocyst (early state embryo) altered, thus effectively leading to births of 'super humans'.   Even more interesting thought: societies of the far future might systemically modify the genetic makeup of embryos to create humans that are 'truly' equal. In that sense, gene doping abuse will probably one day backfire, but, most likely, none of us will be around to see that happen. In the experimental era of genetic modifications, we are the lucky generation that will get to abuse and benefit from the outcome of novel research. And then the generations after that will have a very shitty time because of us. The natural cycle of life in society.    Well, they make the most of what little they have...    HA! My reaction...   Blame humans for the existence of this poor... thing.       Insane transformation. Respect!    With genetic modifications. Also, testing on humans [has already been done](http://www.nature.com/mt/journal/v23/n1/full/mt2014200a.html). In children with muscle diseases, they injected an isoform of a well known  TGF- antagonist that bioneutralizes cell signalling hormones, and it resulted in a significant increase muscular strength and mass.          Joke's on you, anti-GMO people. You've been eating these foods since the fifties without knowing it.       'Be gentle' isn't what she would have said.             I'm a big fan of Stephanie Davis.    I study Human Nutrition part time, and a lot of nutritionists believe that fructose, which things like milk chocolate contain a lot of, lead to something that they call the 'sugar-craving cycle'. This is because fructose triggers the brain's hedonic pathway, but not its satiety mechanisms, making you constantly want more because it feels good to eat but never completely satisfies you.    Yes. This. Normally calories are all that matters really, but the average person doesn't count calories, let's be honest.    Cocoa is still relatively healthy, just highly caloric! (sorry for late answer lol!)   I'm sorry, I realize this is not plain English as you asked. I have no time right now, I will try to explain it differently when I come back tomorrow.    Glycemic load, which is based on the formula Glycemic Index*Grams of carbohydrates/100. Glycemic index indicates how fast a particular food is absorbed into the bloodstream. Glycemic load is more accurate, as it also takes into account how much sugar is actually absorbed. For example, carrots have a high glycemic index, but a very low glycemid load, so they are very healthy. When monosaccharide units (sugar) are absorbed, the pancreas secretes insulin, a hormone that 'pushes' nutrients into the system so they can be either used to create energy in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the main metabolic pathway, or stored. Sugar is stored as glycogen in the muscle and liver cells through glycogenesis, and when sugar level in the blood drops, it is converted back to sugar through glycogenolysis, and then to pyruvate through glycolysis. Pyruvate is a compound that then undergoes various other transformations in order to be ultimately used by our metabolism to produce the energy that our body needs to survive. Surplus is stored beginning when carboxylate is removed from pyruvate to form acetyl co-enzyme A, which is then converted to fatty acids and triglycerides through lipogenesis; excess triglycerides are combined with phospholipids, cholesterol and proteins to form chylomicrons, lipoprotein molecules that can carry triglycerides through the bloodstream (as triglycerides on their own are not water soluble) so they can be released from the lipoproteins and reassembled in the adipocytes, the body's fat cells.On the other hand, fatty acids are used to synthesize two particular compounds, known as beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, via a process known as ketosis, in order to reform acetyl coenzyme-A; those two compounds are part of a group of water-soluble molecules known as the ketone bodies, and ketosis is the main reason why the body can produce energy despite the absence of carbohydrates.

The impact, if you want to use the "block" analogy , is much greater that the original static load and it impacts on only one floor in this simple model. If this implact is greater than the floors ability to withstand it (it's dynamic load rating) then the floor will come apart. (I'm not arguing the model, as it's kind of silly, just that even if you try to use it, his conclusions ignore this point.)  Try this simple math - let the upper 13 floors weigh one pound each, so the weight pressing down on the "lower block" is 13 pounds on 9/10/2001. The detached upper block accelerates on 9/11/2991 for 12 (distance between floors) feet at 18 feet per second (Chandler's video) so the terminal velocity of the block is roughly10 feet per second. F=1/2 MV^2, so the thirteen blocks exert an impact of (13*10*10)/2=650 lbs on the top floor of the block. If this is greater than the design load of the floor - or its weakest links, then it will come apart at those points. Note the huge difference between 13 and 650 in terms of load. The next floor impact is even worse as the constant acceleration means that the velocity is greater (from Chandler) and so the force is even greate by the SQUARE of the velocity (and the mass might be up by a bit too).   https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/3ct4iy/top_minds_continue_to_believe_that_because_these/csyswgm   I was kind of shocked at the number of kids we had that believed this shit when I was studying civil engineering. That probably explains why they got C's or D's in dynamics though!  I'll elaborate slightly. I don't build or design buildings. I build roads; they're what I know and am good at. However, I have taken two structural analysis and design courses, as well as a steel design course, so I imagine that puts me at or above 98% of the general public when it comes to understanding how the towers fell.   Here goes; when you build a building there's basically two types of loadings you'll design for: static and dynamic. Static loadings are the loads on a structure that don't change; desks, computers, filing cabinets, the actual weight of the building itself, stuff like that. Dynamic loadings are a bit trickier as they can move; people, water from rain/snow on the roof, wind, seismic, etc. You get the idea.   I'm not certain on the Factor of Safety (FOS) used for the Towers' design, but let's assume it was 2. What that means is in a static situation, all other things being equal and there being no dynamic forces acting on the building (a perfect classroom scenario, obviously not real world), you'd basically be able to stack one tower on top of the other and it would be able to support it.   It gets trickier with dynamic loading because in theory you could have all of the weight focused on a minute point, which you obviously couldn't design for as it would require truly massive structural members to support so dynamic FOS is, let's say, 1.1.   Once the first floor started to accelerate downwards, the was nothing that could stop the floor below it from failing immediately after the dynamic load hit it. Now you've got two floors falling, then three, and so on. For the buildings to be sturdy enough to handle a moving weight like that falling even 10 feet would require gargantuan beams. I'm taking beams that are 4 feet tall (looking at it where it makes an "I") and weigh several hundred pounds per foot. Something that heavy could not support itself.   Another thing to mention is the whole steel beams thing. Everyone needs to shut the hell up about "jet fuel can't melt steel beams" bullshit. It didn't have to melt the beams. All it had to do was weaken them. Steel loses 70% of its tensile strength at only 25-30% of it's melting point, which was definitely reached during the fires. For those of you playing along at home, that would mean the building would have had to have been built with an FOS of 4 or more, which is not feasible financially, and quite possibly structurally. I would also be remiss if I didn't mention that our quality control standards in the 70's weren't nearly as good as they are today. Is venture as well that the quality of the materials used aren't as good as they are now.   I know only a few will see this, but I hope it might help you explain it to the layman that believes all of this bullshit.    and i commit a crime with all the weed i smoke everyday but aint nobody deporting me   wouldnt u take a risk to see ur mom, kids, etc again?   the only time /r/kappa has upvoted subzero   how lucky for them    non predatory? they bought the whole world and sit on their money... fake socialists   you sound about as libertarian as norway is "socialist"   yea id rather have james chen over spooky most of the time.. mostly because spooky usually commentating weeklys, very lazy-like   10 fucking years in prison for leaking stratfor e-mails..   have u been in the streamline courts?? 50 defendants/lawyer/day?  wtf is this shit   OPERATION STREAMLINE: There is one lawyer for all 23 men.

 Why do you hate him?   Yeh completely understand and I can't be arsed with it all either, would love to just skip to the start of the season. I'm confident we will have a good summer though, everyone is on holiday, give it another week/two and reckon we will see it all start clicking into place    Just quite confident that we will get him, can't really explain why I am but I think because a lot of players are on holiday that's why nothing is happening and being said that seems like it's on the cusp   My Man!!! Didn't even know, definitely getting it now as a birthday treat to myself   The rumours did come from seemingly nowhere but Canal+ or whoever there sport channel that tweeted it seemed certain we were in for him, have a feeling LVG would like him and sees him as an ideal Carrick replacement as well   Probably schneiderlin I reckon is the most likeliest at the minute. Dunno who we are targeting for RB now   Fowler, McManaman, Beglin etc   Dan Abnett and Andy Lannings Nova run especially now with the movies starting to show a bit more of the cosmic side   I know, it's a damn shame. My grandad said he was confident of us scoring whenever Law had a chance    I've posted before about meeting The King on here and I'll just say it all again he was amazing, kept me talking about football, got pictures with him and just an all round great bloke and a pleasure to talk too and spend some time with.   My grandad always goes on about him, Best, Charlton, Byrne etc but when he talks about the holy trinity he gets a glint in his eyes and you can still see the wonder. He says he's the greatest striker he's ever seen play football not just for United and my grandad has watched a lot over the years. He had it all according to him and could do everything you wanted in a striker, he is The King   Yep Real doing what they do best   Oh of course they are pricks, I know he's leaving but can't be arsed with a new story every day with nothing in it till he leaves   Them and Real leaking loads of shit to their mouth pieces   Then they can do that and shut up this year   Well having no defence until December is a tad troublesome...   The amount of stuff he posts he's bound to get ones right, a week or so ago he said Dani Alves was ready to go to PSG and the contract was done and then Alves came out and said PSG was never an option and Blanc denied everything   And a lot of United fans wished Ronaldo all the best and still do, it's all down to the manner in which they are leaving   Roy Keane, his performance against Juve after knowing he won't be playing in the champions league final was astonishing, dragged us to the final.  	18

 A real human bean   I am from Canada as well and I have seen commercials for the Canadian army. They were really high-quality too.   So let's say episodes 7-9 all turn out to be successful, what would you think about a remake of episodes 1-3 (assuming that is legally possible)? They would stick to the same storyline and plot relatively, but get rid of things that were quite obviously failures, and maybe add some new things in to make it feel like a different movie, and fix George Lucas' problems. Then these prequels would replace the old ones as canon, and the old ones could be called the "Jar Jar Trilogy" or something and will basically be referred to as Star Wars' blunder years.   I think it could definitely work if done correctly. The prequels are actually a great story, just not told very well, in my opinion. What do you think about this?   Because I still haven't seen Star Wars: The Force Awakens. And yes, I'm being completely serious.    It provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore, much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery. It makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.   *tips* m'lady   So awesome, I just ordered mine off the Lego shop yesterday, can't wait till it arrives.   Search your feelings. You know it to be true!   I can`t believe they made Jar Jar black! XD lol /r/dadjokes amirite??   This is great, please do another one next year!

 I remember watching cartoons where the restaurant would make them go wash dishes in the back, but I think it's more of a "just leave" type situation.

Necessary    Ryan Dunn   This is usually overlooked, but to this day there isn't a more scientific reason we sleep other than because we get sleepy. Why can't we go days without sleeping? Why do we get sleepy?    When Kat dies in Halo: Reach. That was completely unexpected.   Oh my god I thought I did something wrong when it was up in my face but I guess that happens for everyone.   Actually for awhile they put foot ringers at the end of caskets so people could push the levers with their feet if they were alive   When people say "in a minute" when they mean a large amount of time longer than a minute. "Hey man I haven't seen you in a minute." It's been like a year, I don't understand.    Honestly this was the best show I've ever seen   The movie Dragon Wars from a few years ago, utterly unwatchable. Not in the good way.   But why?    How do you make a tissue dance?

I once pulled my ex girlfriend's pants up to hide her thong from the rest of my high school and we got into a fight  because she should "be allowed to show as much skin and not be sexualized by men in society," but sexuality is definitely needed, if not in small amounts.  	51
 And that's the beauty of a bike. Cars try to be dicks but their efforts typically fail.  Unless they hit you of course.   The NSFW tag is integral to the joke though.   Oddly that's really good.

My Wrangler has the same thing. It's pretty cool.   Yeah, I was thinking that too. Maybe pulling from instagram and facebook?   He does this for a bunch of cities. Really cool. Any idea where he gets his data from?   Lol.... Well, it's neither a naked woman nor is it a random wiki article. No chance at karma....lol   Ha, no way I would have guessed that the best way for a female to get karma was to post her naked pics. I mean that goes against all common sense.....  I'm going to do my best but you know this post stands no chance right?   I can't imagine the guilt that he must feel for laying these. But he's saved lives by removing them and I hope that gives him peace.   Belts aren't there to be comfortable. There's nothing comfortable about them which is why they get put on for the lift and taken off right after.  I much prefer a lever belt to a prong. If you've got wraps on as well as a belt the last thing you want to do is struggle with your belt while the wraps are cutting off your circulation. It's just a lot easier for me to use a lever belt in general.  I've never heard anyone shatter a lever and would love to talk to the person who had this happen.   I wouldn't leap to that conclusion. The math was really simple and doesn't necessarily mean that most librarian's are named Julia.  This is a quote from their blog: "Take Elvis, for example. There arent all that many Elvises out there, but a particularly high percentage of them are musicians. As a result, Elvis ranks high among musician names. Elvis isnt the most common name among musicians  thats likely to be John or some other very popular name. Whats interesting is that its way more common among musicians than you might expect, given how rare it is. In other words, its common in that profession relative to its overall frequency.  Fortunately, the math behind this isnt too complicated. Heres another example, this time with some numbers. In our sample of two and a half million people, a whopping 1.9% of Arnolds are accountants. Contrast that with just 0.55% of Shanes. Arnolds therefore appear to have a much higher tendency to be accountants than Shanes."  Here's the link to their blog http://www.verdantlabs.com/blog/   A follow up from on the "Top disproportionately common names by profession" discussion.  Sorry for the American slant.     	14

"The quake occurred at a depth of less than two miles, which is considered shallow, and potentially more damaging than quakes emanating from deeper down.

"Comcast and Time Warner Cables decision to end Comcasts proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable is in the best interests of consumers," Wheeler said. "The proposed transaction would have created a company with the most broadband and the video subscribers in the nation alongside the ownership of significant programming interests."  He added: "Today, an online video market is emerging that offers new business models and greater consumer choice. The proposed merger would have posed an unacceptable risk to competition and innovation, including to the ability of online video providers to reach and serve consumers."  And he said: "I am especially proud of our close working relationship throughout the review process with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Our collaboration provided both agencies with a deeper understanding of the important issues of innovation and competition that the proposed transaction raised.      from February 13: http://news.sky.com/story/1426811/volunteers-rush-to-save-stranded-whales         From http://www.weather.com/news/news/chile-calbuco-volcano-eruption-evacuations-alerts:        "We don't have any problems with supplies, water or sewage up to now. That's not the problem," said Bachelet, who visited the area Thursday. "Our problem is a respiratory one, from inhaling all of this ash, and the fact that this ash could generate some sort of environmental contamination."         wow those are amazing, ty.   "A farm east of Hawley, Minnesota is preparing for the worst after initial tests come back presumably positive for avian flu.  As Valley News Live first reported Tuesday, more than 300,000 may have to be destroyed if the test is confirmed positive. Amon Baer says the birds are all contained and there are no eggs on store shelves."  Different source: "It may be too late for the Red River Valley to contain the avian flu. Valley News Live has learned a farm just southeast of Hawley, Minnesota may have to destroy hundreds of thousands of chickens after initial test results come back positive for avian flu. We first met Amon Baer nearly two years ago when summer's heat took a toll on his chickens. Now, he'd rather take the heat over what he's looking at, a presumed positive test for avian flu. "We've been very vigilant in trying to monitor the birds and watch them for any signs of disease," Baer said. Baer said he works with around 300,000 chickens on his farm every day. He noticed Monday something wasn't right with about 30 of them. "I know what a healthy bird looks like and these looked a little sick, under the weather, breathing difficulty, a little foaming from the mouth," Baer said. What Baer doesn't know is how some of his birds came down with the virus, though wild waterfowl are known for carrying it. "We don't have wild geese or ducks in the barn. I don't know how it would have transferred from the waterfowl into the building," Baer said. Now the building will have to be emptied. All 300,000 chickens will likely be wiped out completely once the final test comes back. A livelihood put on hold. "It's very deflating. I've been in the business for 50 years and we've never had a disease outbreak on the farm to speak of that amounted to anything," Baer said. A hit to the Baer Brothers Farm that was luckily caught early. "They have a 48 hour period. None of the eggs that would have been quarantined here have gotten into any customers hands," Baer said. The USDA and APHIS will be out on the farm Wednesday to work out a plan to compost all of the birds. Baer said a final test result is expected then as well.

"In past decades, Oklahomans experienced only about one and a half earthquakes exceeding magnitude 3.0 in an average year. But since a boom in oil and gas exploration began in the mid-2000s, that number has mushroomed. The state recorded 585 quakes of 3.0 or greater last year, more than any state except Alaska, and is on course to register more than 900 such tremors this year."  "Larger quakes have also occurred. A series of shocks in 2011 exceeding magnitude 5.0 caused millions of dollars in damage. Some seismologists have warned that the state is risking larger and more damaging quakes unless it acts to reduce the number of tremors."          http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/20/us/siberia-fires-seattle-red-sunsets/  http://www.rgj.com/story/news/2015/04/20/siberian-smoke-reno-winds-bring-haze-field-fires/26083063/  http://www.rferl.org/content/death-toll-in-siberia-wildfires-reaches-34-putin-orders-repairs/26969434.html      Theres also the question of private property on both sides of the equation  private mineral rights and private homes, says the mayor. And its a public safety issue. It does raise questions about long-term infrastructure cost. It is something weve got to consider. I am a big proponent of natural gas and what it could do for energy independence in this country. The question of how and where we should be doing it is what we need science to help us figure out. Its good city policy if we know what the safest way to extract it is."  http://cityhallblog.dallasnews.com/2015/04/rawlings-now-even-more-anxious-to-get-smus-study-showing-cause-of-dallas-irving-quakes.html/    Before the occurrence of probable injection-induced earthquakes in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in 2008, the historic seismicity record includes only one felt earthquake within the 140,000km2 Fort Worth Basin.  The recent increase in US seismicity is not a natural phenomenon but is instead caused by human practices, primarily wastewater injection.  This is the study the article cites: Causal factors for seismicity near Azle, Texas, http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150421/ncomms7728/full/ncomms7728.html       It's a miracle!   Tasso may have some competition. http://www.wired.com/2014/02/elizabeth-holmes-theranos/   Started about 3 months ago as I recall. http://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/tech/science/environment/2014/12/31/beach-covered-dead-birds/21118781/  Now we're seeing stuff like this:http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/21/business/millions-of-hens-in-iowa-to-be-destroyed-as-bird-flu-spreads.html?_r=0   Parts of Pa   NJ too looks like,http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/ww0090.html      yes she seems to have gotten it correct :)   ty a lot:)   Yes, I agree it is not normal.  ( and yes I can understand and picture  the possibility of a "stalled low pressure system that creates a 'loop' in the Jet Stream.").  My real question of course is 'Why?'.  The physical causes are very nicely explained in your link, tyvm! I suppose that means my real question is 'How' did this happen?  No!, I do not please! wish to hear a long winded explanation of climate warming from the start of time, tyvm:)  I am rather more curious as to how any of the stagnant factors came to exist.  Exactly:)  ok going off to apply for work at Rutgers with Ms. Lewis:)     no! seriously consider the words of 'rock-a-bye-baby'  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-a-bye_Baby   new favorite song :)  ty!   well. I do like her :)   Atm we here on the east coast of the usa are experiencing winds running east to west.    I don't recall having felt these before, but perhaps they are more common than I think; in my recollection this is very unusual.  (pardon me as I go look up stuff:)  http://hint.fm/wind/  Edit 1: pretty sure if I was in the eye of all that I'd want to leave.      Free-diving.  Also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haenyeo#History_of_haenyeo   u willow?   I'm wondering if 'the blob'  (http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/04/10/californias-drought-and-the-weird-warm-blob-in-the-pacific-that-may-be-fueling-it/) is messing with their sonar somehow...of course I am also wondering if the 4-corner methane gas pileup is causing 'the blob'.    Stuff flows from a higher concentration to a lower usually, so if the methane is retaining heat why would the blob move?   If the methane is the result of underground shifts, well then they may all be tied up in one scary package, no?     no the part about 11 years x months is the minimum time he has left to serve, "Kurti was given a minimum tariff of 12 years, but will have to serve another 11 years and four months before he can be considered for parole due to time spent in custody awaiting trial."  He is being held 'at her Majesty's pleasure' meaning that if he still sucks at the end of this term, further imprisonment can result.   Does anyone have a current comparative chart of international recidivism rates?   I can only seem to find rather old information.   yea that really needs to be changed.     I warned you:)  OK but the article says "The NRAO isn't happy. The iRobot lawnmowers would be using a frequency range they say is reserved for their telescopes -- 6240 to 6740 MHz."  I read that the common walkie talkies people use, use 462 and 467 MHz in the ultra high frequency (UHF) band. according to the Family Radio Service wiki. I noticed the RC stuff run at a lower  frequency as well.  http://rcvehicles.about.com/od/frequency/p/US-RC-Frequencies.htm  u/marmz1 said something about the frequencies used by the RC folk requiring line-of-sight.  So that has me wondering if using these lower frequencies coupled with digital spectrum modulation wouldn't overcome that objection.  I'm thinking it's a cost thing, but honestly I don't know enough to know.  If you get a moment, would you please ELI5 why this wouldn't resolve the issue of tripping over the astronomers wavelengths?   Thanks!   I'm trying to overcome the objections to using a different frequency, such as those made above by u/marmz1   http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/magazine/the-radical-humaneness-of-norways-halden-prison.html is a pretty good read.  Recidivism rates in Norway are far lower than those in the states.    A way this robot can run without interference with the astronomers wavelengths.  I get a little tenacious sometimes.   would using DSM (Digital Spectrum Modulation) technology make any sense or is it too expensive ?    thanks!   thank you. one more :)     The article says "The NRAO isn't happy.

The common walkie talkies people use, use 462 and 467 MHz in the ultra high frequency (UHF) band. according to the Family Radio Service wiki. These wouldn't require a sight line, no?     why would it be problematic for these robots to run using the walkie-talkie frequencies?  Shouldn't be that difficult to set up individual, buyer-set programs using these, no?  I'm just guessing here.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Radio_Service  or the RC bands? http://rcvehicles.about.com/od/frequency/p/US-RC-Frequencies.htm   my fav is when they add the deposits last, so they get to hit you with fees.   I don't think they can really conclude that just because the people are thought to have been isolated, that there was no opportunity for bacteria to spread to the population.             This is the sort of judge we need to crowd source into higher office.   well glad no out-of-control brush/forest fires are being reported from this yet.   from the article: 'However, the legislation does permit employers to use credit checks in certain cases. For example, the police department could review a person's credit history in hiring new officers, and employers could use the checks in considering candidates for jobs that involve cybersecurity or fiduciary duties.'   I'm not from Arizona. Agree.   they're talking about the effects of the the 'morning-after pill'.

Sporting a Tolstoyan white beard and speaking in heavily accented Russian, John Kopiski engaged the president in a conversation about milk production. Mr Kopiski, a father of five with a Russian wife who has been a Russian citizen since 1997, told Mr Putin that he had 1,700 head of cattle producing 10,000 litres of milk each a year, but that he couldn't make enough money because of low prices for his product.  The farmer, who lives in the Vladimir region near Moscow, suggested to Mr Putin that his aides might be fearful of telling him about the real state of the economy. "You have the statistics and according to them everything is good," said Mr Kopiski, after Mr Putin had reeled off figures suggesting an economic upturn. "Do you believe in the statistics that you are shown? Or do are you lied to, because they're afraid to tell you the truth, or is something else not right with these statistics?"  Mr Putin appeared amused and inquired how Mr Kapiski had come to be in Russia, asking if was "Cherchez la femme? Looking for a wife?" The president then said that he trusted the statistics provided to him and he was aware of farmers' problems. "And of course we will raise state support," he said. "I think the government will have to do that."  With his distinctive looks and unusual background, John Kopiski admits he has become something of a celebrity in the small world of Russian milk producers.  So when a member of the countrys dairy producers' union asked him to speak up on the troubled industrys behalf, he agreed - provided, he said, that he was allowed to tell Putin the truth. I got an invitation out of the blue, and at first I wasnt sure about it. Then I was told I could ask whatever I wanted so I said yes. I wrote the question myself and I didnt have to show it to them in advance, he told the Telegraph after the event.  Mr Kopiski, a former London coal and steel trader, moved to Russia in 1992 after falling in love with the country on a business trip. He subsequently married, converted to Russian Orthodoxy, and took citizenship in 1997. Since 2004 he and his Russian wife, Nina, have invested millions in developing the Rozhdestvo dairy farm in the Vladimir region.  The farm has been hailed as a showpiece success in a sector still dominated by out-dated, Soviet-era practices. But despite massive success, Mr Kopiski has yet to recoup a single kopeck of his investment. The father of five said it would take at least four more years to pay off $3 million in loans, and his son has told him it would be mad for him to take on the family business when Mr Kopiski retires.  Dairy farmers across Russia are blighted, he says, by a lack of long-term credit, a dysfunctional subsidies system, and the reluctance of officials to admit that the official statistics they have been relying on for years are grossly over-optimistic.  The main point is, how long are we expected to carry on working for nothing? Thats what I feel I have been doing for 11 years now. If you found me a buyer who would take if off me for the money Ive put into it, Id sell like a shot. Its sad, but there it is, he said.  But Mr Kopiski says the experience has not dented his affection for his adopted country or his respect for Mr Putin, who he says is the only option for Russia at the current time. If his accountants are putting dodgy figures in front of him, how is he meant to know what is going on? People have been congratulating me for asking a tough question. Well, if I was encouraged to ask a question like that, I hope it means it will provoke him to have a good look at the issue.  In the meantime, he says, he tries to remain upbeat. As an Orthodox guy, one of the biggest sins is impatience, he said. Im 66 this year. You have some perspective at that age."  In an interview with Radio Free Europe last month, Mr Kopiski said: "I'm Russian, I'm at home here. If tomorrow we need to go to the front, to face Nato, I'll be the first to go."

Except my Quelaag fight. I don't know what happened. I fought her over and over again. Kept dying. After 69 times I go and she isn't there. I never got her soul. I cannot make Quelaags Fury Sword. From every lets play I see they ALWAYS use that sword. Is there any alternative to that sword that I could use in Anor Londo or if any of you have a Quelaag sword or souls that doesn't fit your build could I have it? Keep in mind I am a noob. Thanks! :D   666 is the sign of the anti-christ. In the bible people are marked with that to show that they are with the devil or some shit. I would expect the Mark would be the mark in the bible.

WTF 1 UPVOTE 96 COMMENTS HOW!?!?!?  	72
          ..or Green Berets.    I hope I am as "dead broke" as the Clinton's someday.       [This](http://i.imgur.com/eOIXO8I.png) was the vote count when I found this thread. Let freedom ring!            "I would say it is the most secretive White House that I have ever been involved in covering, and that includes  I spent 22 years of my career in Washington and covered presidents from President Reagan on up through now, and I was Washington bureau chief of the Times during George W. Bush's first term. I dealt directly with the Bush White House when they had concerns that stories we were about to run put the national security under threat. But, you know, they were not pursuing criminal leak investigations," she continued. "The Obama administration has had seven criminal leak investigations. That is more than twice the number of any previous administration in our history. It's on a scale never seen before. This is the most secretive White House that, at least as a journalist, I have ever dealt with." - Jill Abramson / Jan 2014  The real reason she is no longer at NYT, IMO. NYT has become nothing more than a media arm of the Obama admin.       And my original comment never said his point was invalid. I think your anger is really because I do not salivate at the thought of Harry Reid or Dick Cheney. I am not a Republican or Democrat. I was a person in the streets protesting the war. Protesting both parties for what they had done. I believe that both parties are culpable for our current state of affairs, including the Iraq debacle. Both sides disregarded many people from the international community that told us the intelligence was wrong. Both sides did not listen and got us involved in one the biggest foreign policy blunders in our nations history. I do not get caught up in the party paradigm so I guess its just easier for me to hold all elected officials accountable for their choices. I wanted the Bush administration investigated for war crimes. Thanks to the Obama administration we will never see that either. You fail to realize that both sides are to blame and so you come here and attack me for stating a fact. Whether his point was correct or not hes not really in a place to say anything as he is just as culpable. As I see you see things through a very biased set of eyes I feel this conversation continuing will get neither of us anywhere and just waste my time. I will forever hold both parties to blame for the Iraq debacle and nothing you say will change that. I lived it. I protested it.    How is my comment not relevant? Harry Reid is bashing Cheney, and rightfully so, for Iraq yet Harry Reid is partly to blame. He voted to authorize the use of Military force in Iraq giving Bush and Cheney the green light for their pointless war. I just find it odd that someone who gave Cheney the authority to go into Iraq is bashing him for going into Iraq.    So rational. You label me an asshole for pointing out a fact? ok.. I will take my downvotes with pride.    When a Senator is presented with evidence that grossly misrepresented going to war in Iraq (any and all WMD evidence) are you really going to blame him for it?  Yes, people should be held responsible for the decisions they make. Especially a Senator that has the power to hold those responsible for falsifying intelligence and lying to Congress yet fails to do so.    So if someone tells you that something is true and you base your decision on that you are no longer responsible for your choice? Ok...   Harry Reid voted in favor of the Iraq war.      You seem to not understand how mail servers, networks, and backups work.      "I am very optimistic about -- about Iraq. I mean, this could be one of the great achievements of this administration. You're going to see 90,000 American troops come marching home by the end of the summer. You're going to see a stable government in Iraq that is actually moving toward a representative government," Joe Biden 2010   Because I would expect r/politics to be unbiased views from all sides of the political spectrum. Instead r/politics has turned into r/democrats or r/obama. I am not a Republican or Democrat. I just like to see two sides of the debate. Which should be what r/politics is all about. But all you have to do is look through r/politics and understand what types of stories that are allowed to be discussed. Of course you may be biased yourself and not care or not see it. Everything in r/politics has a one sided bias towards politics. What does r/politics expect to get out of having an agenda? what do they expect to get out of everyone sitting around with the same opinions and ideas? I would call it a circlejerk. Its obvious to middle of the road people like myself. r/politics = r/democrats and if you believe otherwise you are either lying to yourself or you havent been here long enough. But you are right. Why do I continue to stay? I guess I just hoped at some point unbiased views would come along but when the moderators are so biased themselves and have their own political agendas its difficult to have have unbiased middle of the road political discussions. Moderators of r/politics flag posts right out of the gate if they do not align with the agenda of the left. Moderators downvote articles that do not necessarily break any rules but go against their personal agendas. Its sad really. I believe both sides of the political aisle are just as culpable for our current state of affairs. But you wouldnt know that reading r/politics. Not that the facts arent out there, its because anything that shows the left in a bad light gets shadow banned, pulled, or downvoted before a discussion can even take place. r/politics should promote both sides of the aisle and many opinions and ideas. If r/politics was the same towards the right I would have just as much of an issue with it. I cant stand political parties and it bewilders me how we can expect to move forward as a nation as long as we sit around in our own little circles pointing the finger at one particular party. But you have made me realize that no one in r/politics cares about the things i just mentioned so I guess you are right. I should unsubscribe and leave you all to your circlejerk.    Abu Duaa was connected to the intimidation, torture and murder of local civilians in Qaim, says a Pentagon document. He would kidnap individuals or entire families, accuse them, pronounce sentence and then publicly execute them.   The men that Obama funded, trained, and armed are leaving the "rebels" and joining ISIS. ISIS also has access to $billions$ of military hardware that the Obama admin decided to leave behind in Iraq.   Biased? You would say anything is biased that doesn't show Obama in a good light. Everyone on Reddit, except r/politics, knows that r/politics is an Obama circlejerk. Obama would have had to authorize it.    Abu Duaa was connected to the intimidation, torture and murder of local civilians in Qaim, says a Pentagon document. He would kidnap individuals or entire families, accuse them, pronounce sentence and then publicly execute them.  Sounds like just the type of guy we should let go.    Camp Bucca was a US military run installation.    I do not need any "news" source to tell me Obama is not "honest and trustworthy". Are you blind?      http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/27saxb/when_bush_paid_terrorists_a_ransom/  You mean like this post? Which seemed to be allowed no problem. But I understand that it fits into the r/politics agenda.    So you have evidence of the said fiction? Not saying there is enough evidence for it be to fact either.

Take your pick.   The House and Senate make up the Congress. Congressman can refer to a person from either house of Congress.   [The World without US](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py4jVOJDwXU feature=kp) is a compelling documentary that speaks to the exact question you ask. I would suggest you watch it. It is available on Netflix.   Gross violations of our Constitution are not "minor issues" in my view. They are the most pressing issues IMO. Economic issues will work themselves out as both individuals will have a vested interest in our economy since they both rely on the economy to survive. I also believe they could find common purpose on economic issues. After what this country has gone through in terms of Constitutional violations in the last 14 years that has become my above all voting condition. Both parties have very similar overall views of economic policy. This is why policies have not changed very much in the last 30+ years. Its the issues such as Constitutional violations that have changed dramatically in the last 30+ years and have detrimental long term effects. Including on the economy. It is being speculated that the NSA revelations will cost American tech companies billions in lost revenue, annually. I believe these two men could find common purpose and do great things for the people and the Constitution of this wonderful nation. I just like to think outside the box. I mean what we have been doing surely isnt working for the people. So why not try something different? I am not a Republican or Democrat. I am just an American that cares about his country and I can see that something drastic and unrealistic may be our only chance at righting some of these wrongs.   Who is VP or P does not concern me between the two. And I refuse to believe that two men like Sanders and Paul, who have deep love for their country, could not find a common agenda to seek together. My mom always told me, "Can't never could do anything."   I find they have common ground on domestic issues including Constitutional violations. Of course there will be differences. But the goal is to go after some of the larger issues that encroaching on civil liberties. NSA, Patriot Act, Executive power, etc.   Democrats would never be able to primary him out. His constituents love him. And why would you support such an ouster? Do you have something against bucking the establishment?   "Brat, who raised less than $300,000 to the House majority leader's campaign war chest of $5.4 million, said, "It's not about David Brat winning tonight, it's about returning the country to its principles."  That money is not as powerful in winning elections as others thought?   If that is what they decided then great. I am more about the substance of what they stand for than whose name is on the ticket first.   But when both men can find common issues where forward is very similar it could do wonders for our country. Establishment candidates are ruining our nation. Doing the same thing is ruining our nation. Voting for the same agendas is ruining our nation. I just thought it was worth the discussion and I would love to hear their views on the idea. I honestly believe they could pull a common agenda together and move forward. But again just thinking outside the box.    To me it would not matter. I am just ready for a real change in politics. Thinking outside the box is something we need more of in terms of politics.    So you believe that men that have two different core ideologies cannot find common ground move forward based on those common principles? Is that not the foundation of our government? Is Congress not setup to compromise different ideologies into one common goal or purpose. I reject the notion that just because they have different core ideologies that they couldnt come to a compromise on the best way to move the country forward. There are issues that need to be addressed such as NSA, Military engagments, NDAA, Patriot Act, etc where they could really lead the charge. The gross violations of our Constitution from both parties is appalling and I believe that as long as we continue to vote for the establishment we will get the same policies. I am just ready to think outside the box. We need men like Bernie and Rand to take on the political parties in this country. Both have a knack for going against the grain. I just believe as Americans we can do anything. We can find common ground and move our country forward. This is why I refuse to believe that these two could not find a common purpose.   Bernie is an Independent. Whether that helps.    That didn't stop Bernie Sanders and Ron Paul from being two of the closest allies in Congress. Why couldn't they work together as Americans and forget about party for a moment? Neither one toe their party lines to begin with.   Ron Paul and Bernie Sanders were two of the closest allies in Congress. So can you elaborate on what you said? Of course I believe that there will be differences. But I also believe that where they are similar is where we need to be focusing our strengths at the moment. Plus it would be a huge tip of the hat to bipartisanship. I believe the two of them together would be a force to be reckoned with. I believe together they could do great things for the people.   I really enjoy both of these Congressmen and what they stand for. I do not get caught up in the party paradigm. Just wondering what your thoughts are on it. Thanks!   r/politics = r/democrats   You new here?   The end of journalism can be traced back to the fact that the majority of major news outlets in the US are owned by just a handful of companies.

"I would say it is the most secretive White House that I have ever been involved in covering, and that includes  I spent 22 years of my career in Washington and covered presidents from President Reagan on up through now, and I was Washington bureau chief of the Times during George W. Bush's first term. I dealt directly with the Bush White House when they had concerns that stories we were about to run put the national security under threat. But, you know, they were not pursuing criminal leak investigations," she continued. "The Obama administration has had seven criminal leak investigations. That is more than twice the number of any previous administration in our history. It's on a scale never seen before. This is the most secretive White House that, at least as a journalist, I have ever dealt with." - Jill Abramson / Jan 2014  I was thinking she was ousted for this...

From my conversations with Dell regarding this specific type of case - Windows 8 machine with Windows 7 downgrade - this is supposed to work.  The new Dells that are set up like this no longer come with Windows 7 COA License key stickers. (and of course Windows 8 keys are stored in the bios) Dell says to use the OEM Windows 7 disk so that it will auto-populate the license key when installing Windows 7. Of course I will also recommend creating the Dell recovery disc on first boot up. Dell recovery is the best way to recreate the system as it was from the factory. But if a disc must be used OEM should do the trick.       What are her views on the NSA disclosures? or the attempt to relabel journalists? or the the attack on whistleblowers?       RIP Layne. Song hits me right in the feels every time. Then I sit and listen to it on repeat for an hour.    I just threw up in my mouth a lil. That burrito tasted better going down.    That makes more sense.    9.5 Million? The Obama admin is saying only 6 Million have signed up? Of that 6 million 80% have actually paid for their coverage.    If its Dell hardware you should be able to just use the Dell OEM Windows 7 recovery DVD you received and it should not ask you for a key. An MSDN disc would ask for key. A Dell OEM disc will not.

Being excited about his death makes you an equal to the people he represented. IMO    The Chinese got most of the oil contracts. US companies were shut out.         Did they change the recipe sometime in the last couple of years? It seems like it has gotten sweeter or more syrupy?   I made it through 4 replays before thinking 'wtf am I doing?'..   Dear American Patriots,  This is how you protest.  Sincerely,  Your fellow patriot.   China and Europe got most of the oil contracts.   My apologies, fellow Patriot. I felt a sudden responsibility to put that damn commie in his place. I will, in the future, overlook this good-for-nothn pinko. Again, fellow Patriot, I would like to apologize for feeding such scum.   I salute you, fellow Patriot.   Hey OP ever been a principal of a school in the projects? no?   I cannot force a company from overseas to continue to buy my product at an increased price. I can increase wages but I have contracts on product pricing. The customers that buy my products would buy from manufacturers overseas instead because they could get them cheaper. Does that make sense? We are not a US Economy. We are a world economy. My entire business is based on customers not based in the US. If my costs go up so does my product cost. My contracts would disappear leaving my company out of business and my employees out of a job. For the record Labor is one of the largest costs of making products. you seem to shove it aside as a non existent cost.   lol What you fail to understand is that if my labor costs change overnight I will be out of business in a month. Labor costs would be immediate. Revenue increases would not. I would be out of business before I ever saw a revenue increase. But you fail to understand that if my labor costs increase so does the cost of my product. So if the cost of goods increases where is the increase in pay? They will just be paying more for goods which would deplete any increase in pay they were afforded. You think things are black and white.. they are not. You can make it look good on paper all you want. Reality is it would be detrimental to our economy.   Why didn't he save the $1 Billion he just gave to Ukraine and use it for Science?   So now you are comparing BO to GW as if they are the same person? and what in the actual phhuck does Russia have to do with it? Get the phhuck out of here you damn commie bastard.    You act like they make it by ok on low margins. That is not the case. They have low margins on the products they sell but make up for it in membership fees. They wouldnt make it on low margins alone.    I am sorry but how did GW have anything to do with the mosque not being built? As an American who lost friends in the towers I personally thought it was insensitive to try and build a mosque down the street from the towers. But I am not GW. And GW had nothing to do with it not being built. You some damn commie or something?  "Ted Olson, former Solicitor General in the George W. Bush administration, whose wife, television commentator Barbara Olson, died in the plane that crashed into the Pentagon, has expressed support for the rights of the Park51 organizers to construct the new site." The only connection you will find between GW and Park51   I understand that if my labor costs increase my company goes out of business killing almost 1000 jobs. I do not need you or some elitist at a desk to tell me this. I see it. I experience it. It will disrupt the economy and cause even more poverty. It will cause more strain on our services. You cannot add $millions$ to my labor costs overnight and not expect a catastrophic event. My margins are so thin it would wipe us out overnight. This is reality, pal. Not some idea thought up on a university campus.   "Costco makes up for those low margins by charging a $55 annual membership fee of its 64 million members."   A considerable amount of people in this country just need a good ass whoopin. People are increasingly getting to a point where they believe their actions do not have consequences. A few good ass whoopins could cure some of this.    If we want to increase wages we must increase our investments in educating our work force for the new 21 century economy. There will be people that fall through the cracks but the change is coming whether we like it or not. We just have to make sure we are as ready as we can be.  	169
       Stories are making a comeback in terms of good places to publish, but not in terms of making decent money. Fiction writers will continue to go for novels when stories markets are considered "professional" when they pay $100 bucks for weeks or months worth of work.    "Genre" is a broad term. Most genres don't sell that well. It's not like writing a Western or Steampunk book in 2015 is going to get you tons of money, even if YA paranormal romance books or thrillers sell well.     My beef is with the snobs who hold up somebody like Jonathan Franzen as some kind of paragon of literary mastery,   What kind of snob holds up Franzen? Franzen is read by people's parents, gets on best seller lists, and gets picked by Oprah. Lit snobs are more likely to look down on reading Franzen than hold him up.                  And they don't pay the writers, thus why they aren't "lucrative" like the thread asked.   Also see this:http://www.aetaltis.com/mythofprorates   Different orgs have different rate guidelines. 6 cents is SFWA's guide, but most professional writers would laugh at that. You can't live on six cents. That's a mere $180 for average story which probably takes weeks to write. "Pro" rate is hobby rate in reality.   Depends on the anthology and publisher, but generally yes, they do   He can buy whatever he wants, but if a magazine publishes a single story, between Amazon's fee and paying artist, illustrator, and ebook maker.... Even at .99 cents there is no money to go around.  People have to pay enough for something to be made or it wont be made.  That's the bottom line here. People don't want to even pay a buck, so there is no story market and writers focus on novels, memoirs, screenplays, and cat listicles since those still pay   There are a TON of magazines. Near infinite. But how many of them pay enough to be a real market?   There might only be 6-10 magazines, if that many, that pay over $1,000 for a story left in America.    You wouldn't pay 1/3rd the price of a cup of coffee for a good story?   Most collections are only 12 stories, and a collection costs 15 bucks. So it would be cheaper than a book on that level.    I thought the Atlantic cut their fiction issue? or they made it a "newstand only" issue instead of a regular one for subscribers?    No, I don't. Here's why:   Books 4/5 were "down" books after all the crazy plot and action of book 1-3 (and especially 3). They are almost like act breaks. People hated them because they were slow moving AND because Martin compensated with a bunch of random new plot lines with characters we didn't know about.   However, book 6 is guarenteed to have a ton of action and forward momentum. Hell book 5 ENDS right before the "battle of ice" AND the "battle of fire." So two huge important battles will take place right at the start of 6. Plus, the White Walkers will probably finally arrive.   So no, I think people will be happy with book 6.    Yeah, it seems totally fine to me to "trim the fat" of Martin's plotlines that don't really tie directly into the main plot.    There are a lot of reasons, but I'd say the number 1 is that print magazines in general are really struggling. Magazines were the only reliable source of income from stories back in the day (few people buy anthologies). And print magazines are the only ones that can afford to PAY for fiction.   There are tons of online magazines, but most pay very little for anything---even journalism.   Today, the only big markets for short stories are the New Yorker and Harper's really.   ETA: and the reason WHY the print mags are dying is the internet really. Magazine shift online (where ad revenue is much lower) and short stories compete with youtube, video games, blogs, and everything else for attention.   Also, the online world is really about individual pieces not magazines. By that I mean, most people go to a story on The Atlantic because they see it on Facebook or twitter or it gets emailed to them. Few people go to TheAtlantic.com and read a whole "issue." In print, people do read a whole New Yorker or whatever including fiction and poetry. Online, a short story or a poem is highly unlikely to go "viral" or have a clickbait headline to lure people in. Thus, fewer people read, and thus fewer magazines publish fiction.     I can condense 'science fiction and fantasy' to one word 'speculative'  Well part of my problem is that the term doesn't mean that clearly. A lot of people use it to mean just science fiction (and really that makes the most logical sense--SF can be said to be "speculating" about future technology and such, but Harry Potter isn't speculating about anything with its magic world and mythical creatures). Others use it to mean just kind of all non-real fiction, others to mean all non-realist genre fiction, etc.       I think it's kind of a silly term as it seems to mostly be used to lump stuff together that comes from different traditions. Like, postmodernism and Latin American magical realism come from separate traditions from what gets normally labeled fantasy or SF. I don't know what's helpful about lumping them all together as "speculative."   It's also a confusing term because there's no common definition. It originally just mean "science fiction" (or, perhaps, "arty" science fiction). Now some people use it that way, like Margaret Atwood, while others use it to mean SF and F, others use it to mean SF, F and H, and others use it to mean SF/F/H/magical reailsm/surrealism/fabulism/fairy tales/postmodernism   Did you make the person unidentifiable? I don't think there is any chance you could be sued.   If you changed Professor Bill Smith of Vassar college to Will Smith of Wasser college, you might theoretically have trouble. Although it is unlikely the public figure will care unless your book starts selling really well    Well, musicians usually stop listening to music when they are creating their own.  uh... what? I know a lot of musicians and I've never heard that before. You mean that while composing a song for a few hours in their studio they don't listen to other music? Maybe, but that doesn't mean they don't listen to music most of the time.    100 X yes.   And really, no offense meant, but why would you want to write a novel if you don't like reading novels? (Or make a film if you don't like watching films? Or write a song if you don't listen to music?)     Most of the writers you list wrote realistic works in the sense that their "fictional world" is our world, so they wouldn't really have internal logic problems unless they just messed up some facts.   I'm sure that many authors have small errors (like a shirt changing color or something.) However, these things are less common in books than in films because in films they are often caused by so many people working on the project and one of them slipping up (putting the wrong shirt at the actor's door or whatever)   Such an amazing book. Everyone should read Calvino.       Yeah it's a pretty different thing from, say, Lord of the Rings which is one continued narrative with the same characters. Or Dune, which follows same characters and locations over generations. Etc.   Does the Hainish cycle even repeat any characters?   Sometimes literary authors take a character from one book and use them in a very different context in another, and we don't call those part of a "series"              Richard Price wrote for The Wire and is a GREAT novelist.   George RR Martin wrote for various TV shows before Game of Thrones /ASOIAF.   (I'm pretty sure S. by JJ Abrams was really written by co-writer and Abrams came up with the general idea.)   No prob! It didn't show up when I searched links for some reason, sorry                  Wiki: Le Guin herself has discounted the idea of a "Hainish Cycle", writing on her website that "The thing is, they aren't a cycle or a saga. They do not form a coherent history. There are some clear connections among them, yes, but also some extremely murky ones."'  Brave New World sequel? He wrote a non-fiction book on BNW later and Island, which is like a thematic counterpart but isn't a "sequel" in the sense the OP is talking about... a continued fictional story over multiple books.    It's definitely true for fantasy, probably because "epic fantasy" dominates and it is hard to be epic in a short novel.   Not sure it is totally true for SF. Dune and Hitchhiker's Guide are series, but most people only read the first book.   But:   * 1984 * The Martian Chronicles * The Left Hand of Darkness * Brave New World * Dhalgren * Stranger in a Strange Land * Slaughterhouse Five * The Handmaid's Tale * Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?   I think most of the big SF books are standalone.   If you want a reason though I would say probably because "genre" fiction is more geared towards sales than literary fiction, and series sell. They sell for TV shows, they sell for film franchises, and they sell for books. Look at the endless reboots and spin-offs we get in comics, TV, film...  So it isn't just fantasy and to a degree SF. It's also true of mysteries, crime fiction, romances, thrillers...   yeah that's a good point too. Plenty of the beat poets and others self-published too.     because they're automatically accepted as literature.   I think Dawgbro's point is that they AREN"T "automatically" accepted. Quite the opposite, they stood up against dozens or hundreds of years of criticisms to be considered classic.    I'm wondering if that confirmation bias is what keeps them popular today, rather than the writing itself  Confirmation bias plays into everything, but keep in mind that tons of books that are considered classics stop being read every year. If you went back and a looked at a 100 best books ever list from 1950, there would be a lot of titles that we don't read anymore. No label protects a book if readers don't like it.      I feel like the label "classic" has protected these books from a lot of criticism,   I mean... sure, things that are highly regarded are less likely to be criticized 100 years later. But keep in mind that these were never classics the day they were published. Many of them had negative reviews or had struggles getting published in their day. Some took 10 or 20 or 50 years to be considered classics.   So it isn't that they didn't get criticism, it's that they fought (and won) their critical battles already. I mean, really, who has something really NEW to say about Cervantes? Is a critic in 2015 going to really "expose" Cervantes?   But all the classics get a bazillion 1 star reviews on Amazon from angry students anyway.    Which, in turn, makes me wonder how many unknown e-books floating around out there today would have earned the "classic" label had they been published verbatim as serials 150 years ago.  Well, probably not too many because most books that have the kind of style, themes, and power that make them last and be considered classics still get published through traditional presses. That might change in 20 years time of course.    Your bosses are silly. Autobiographical fiction dates back to like the start of fiction. If anything, all memoirs should be called novels because they all fictionalize a ton of things.    It depends. I mean I do think it's true that most series (whether TV or books) are not as consistency good as the best stand-alone works (novels or films). The best stand-alone works are great through and through, but even the best TV shows or (long) novel series have a few clunky chapters/episodes or even mediocore seasons or books.   That said, there is nothing wrong with liking a series!                  I know so many people who complain about being forced to take biology and advanced math and other subjects that have zero bearing on their jobs in the real world.   But I still like the idea of education providing a well-rounded experience, and teaching people things beyond what they have to directly use at their day job.   Personally, writing classes were easily the most useful skills I learned.   Most STEM classes, history classes, and so on in HS and for non-majors are just rote memorization of facts that you quickly forget, but basic writing skills are used every day.       Gotta disagree with the above. "Essay" writing skills transfer pretty directly to general writing, thinking, and information conveying skills that everyone needs. So you are a STEM dude and you don't write essays for your job? Sure, but you probably write emails, you probably have to persuade people in meetings, you probably have to write cover letters and so on and so forth.                   A Le Monde study showed only 1% of their cartoons attacked Islamic extremists (something like 5% targeted Catholic church and Christians). Vast majority of their work was on politics, sports, and economics.                                              The Nebulas, Hugos, and Locus awards all have different voting methods. For that matter, Pulitzer and National Book Awards have even more different ones. Each award is different.             heh   Yeah, that label get slapped on almost ANY book with a teen protagonist. Plus, those two books are often taught in high schools as it is anyway.                      I agree with you there, he certainly wasn't this revered in his lifetime (although how could anyone be? He's the most celebrated writer in English ever). But his troop was literally patroned by the fucking King and he was celebrated by his fellow writers.   Also, according to this it didn't take till the 18th century to valorize him:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare%27s_reputation   By contrast to the stage history, in literary criticism there was no lag time, no temporary preference for other dramatists: Shakespeare had a unique position at least from the Restoration in 1660 and onwards. While Shakespeare did not follow the unbending French neo-classical "rules" for the drama and the three classical unities of time, place, and action, those strict rules had never caught on in England, and their sole zealous proponent Thomas Rymer was hardly ever mentioned by influential writers except as an example of narrow dogmatism. Dryden, for example, argued in his influential Essay of Dramatick Poesie (1668)  the same essay in which he noted that Shakespeare's plays were performed only half as often as those of Beaumont and Fletcher  for Shakespeare's artistic superiority. Though Shakespeare does not follow the dramatic conventions, Dryden wrote, Ben Jonson does, and as a result Jonson lands in a distant second place to "the incomparable Shakespeare", the follower of nature, the untaught genius, the great realist of human character.   Influencing a genre IS a big deal. Agree there. Although it could probably be argued that both Rowling and Gaiman have been more influential in fantasy in the same time period.   But I like Martin so don't care too much to pursue that.    Honestly, whether ripping off or homaging McCarthy, this is just nowhere near close enough of a quote to be plagiarism. So I disagree with your mother.   Probably it was unintentional, but I'm sure Doerr has read Blood Merdian. Sometimes quotes get stuck in writers heads and they unconsciously borrow years later.     Have you/do you plan to "work your way up" the short fiction market echelons or did/will you start at the top of the heap?  I think this is a good way to do it. Some people think you should just shoot for the top, but what I'd do is be realistic: get a list of 10 magazines you think are very good but not like the top magazines* who only take agented submissions (New Yorker, Harper's, whatever) and submit to them. When you get rejected, go to your next 10 picks. Then your next 10.   If your story is getting rejected more than 20-30 times, it is probably time for a serious rewrite or a new story.   Ideally, you have a half-dozen stories you are sending out, each to different places, all the time.   * agree with commentor below who says that starting at the top for SF/F magazines isn't crazy, they aren't as selective as a New Yorker type place.... although they are still very hard!    Depends what you mean. It's much easier to get into Glimmer Train than say The Paris Review, New Yorker, or Tin House. But I doubt they take more than 1% of their submissions so it's still very hard.    Good post!   You have to distinguish between immediate popularity and long term popularity. THe bestseller lists of past decades are filled with names that none of us would recognize. Being popular as a fad doesn't mean you will be read in 100, 50, or even 10 years.     George rr Martin may not be Shakespeare but he is undoubtedly going to become a defining author of this decade.   This raises a question about the difference between a defining AUTHOR and a defining WORK.   ASOIAF is clearly the dominant work of adult fantasy of the least 50 years (in English at least).   But that doesn't mean that Martin's prose or style of writing will be a big influence beyond encouraging publishers to publish more giant high fantasy series.   Like Martin is a million times better than EL James, but EL James likewise wrote the "defining" work of her genre--50 Shades of Grey--that has caused real changes in the publishing industry and reading public. Does that mean that EL James is a "defining author" though? I'd bet in 50 years no one will remember her, beyond being a historical footnote about a really popular erotica book that shook up the industry.   Martin, again, is much better and a ASOIAF will last I think.     Shakespeares contemporaries talked shit about him too.  Who? Shakespeare was widely regarded as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, playwright of his time by fellow writers based on what I've read.    I wouldn't go so far as to say it is "bad" but I think he has some major flaws. Style is subjective, but here are some things I can see people disliking:   1) He is a little too enamored of his fake/archaic english words and it starts getting silly seeing "nuncle" "wroth" "leal" and "boiled leather" every other sentence. (He also uses some of those words, like "wroth" incorrectly)  2) His interior thoughts have always struck me as needlessly repetitive. He makes his characters state things that we already know.   3) His characters are often pretty one deminsional and kind of comically focused on singular things. Now, I know someone is going to tell me that his characters are really dynamic over the course of the whole series... that is somewhat true. But those books are HUGE. The 5 ASOIAF are about the size of 30 normal novels. If it takes you 30 novels to make your characters change and grow, that's not that impressive. If you read AGOT, the characters are mostly pretty flat.   4) He relies why too much on fake out cliffhangers.   5) In general, I can't remember a single sentence from the books. I can't even really remember much atmosphere or mood. All I remember is plot.   Ultimately I agree with you that his prose is "not brilliant" but "solid." I don't agree that it is a "strong voice" though! It's a preetty forgettable voice outside of his use of archaic english words and made up fantasy terms. If you took a few of his sentences and removed those elements, you'd never be able to pick his prose out of a line-up in the way you could Faulkner or Hemingway or whoever truly has a strong voice.    Well however you want to define it, there are some books that try to make their prose as simple as possible and focus all efforts on the plot and "page turner" quality. Some books like that, that dont' offer anything except plot ideas, twists, and turns, will lose a lot from knowing the ending.   But you won't lose much of anything from a truly great masterpiece just because you know the ending. You know?   Now, to be clear, there are books that have fantastic plots AND are really well written. I'm not saying that plot is opposed to great writing in that way at all.   I'm not talking Fight Club or Ender's Game really, and I'm certainly not talking about Raymond Chandler or Philip K. Dick, but more like Dan Brown or James Patterson kind of books.   Depends on the book.   Great literary fiction is about far more than plot and knowing, say, the end to Moby-Dick or Lolita is not going to ruin them.   But some "beach read" type fiction that rests entirely on plot--especially plot twists--rests on you not knowing the ending.    People always seem to think the world will end, but I do think it's true that today feels very precarious... perhaps not at the height of the Cold War, but with climate change, the recent near collapse of the global economy, etc. there is a lot of apocalyptic feeling about.   It seems like your main point is that literary fiction's recent post-apoc trend was predated by a SF/horror one that the lit mainstream largely ignored.   I think that's true overall, although Ballard, Jackson, and Vonnegut have been long embraced by the lit mainstream.   (Jackson's The Sundial was published on FSG, the gold-standard of lit publishers, not a genre publisher for example)        "Always meant for Sauron to win, but wussed out at the last moment" - JRR Tolkien                         maybe try r/writing or one of the writing forums            Well, you and I disagree about Littlefinger's motivations. I think he wants as much power as possible, and you are more likely to gain territory and armies by running a whole sub-kingdom than by being a treasurer with no noble title in court.      Its why he pisses away a cushy position at the capital to abscond off to the Eyrie with Sansa.  Really? Littlefinger doesn't just abscond to the Eyrie, he maneuvers himself to be lord protector of the Vale. His power has increased immensely.   Also, cushy position? Maybe, except surely he sees the writing on the wall that pyscho cersei is coming into power.          The show only has so many characters they can really juggle though. Sansa already is major. Ramsay is fairly big. Theon is in winterfell.   So the storyline makes total sense from a TV perspective. Having Sansa do nothing and Ramsay deal with some no name woman character wouldn't work for TV         I'm also referencing the dozens of essays on Hebdo from people who haven't read them in Salon, Slate, The Atlantic, everywhere.    Honestly, I'm not sure. I remember Teju Cole's essay on Hebdo being critiqued by people who actually live in France and actually read french. I'd bet that most of the withdrawing people are basing their assesment on second hand info from people who aren't totally aware of the context.       I honestly feel like 99% of people attacking Hebdo haven't read more than like 3 cartoons that they didn't even bother to translate or try to understand.   I have some issues with Hebdo's cartoons, but most people are just talking out of ignorance.                Hmm, yeah I wonder what the difference is. The big lit mags get several thousand a year, maybe even up to 20k. (NYer or something gets way more). No clue what the genre ones get.       Oh I meant that he was maybe referencing existing french laws that are seen as anti-muslim, not that he was calling for censorship laws   I think he means the nation as in the government and the laws they've passed, but yeah it's a bit much   Dude is also from Australia, which has famously fucked up race relations. Glass house and all that.                ha, that's a nice comparison actually (I like that band a lot though)   I thought Annhilation was one of the best SF books I've read in years. It's taut, beautifully written, genuinely creepy, does the Lovecraft unknowable horror in a new way, and was really well paced.   The second book wasn't quite my thing.   Third book was a true halfway between the two and a very good read.     I felt that the three books in separate (instead of a single book) were a marketing ploy  disagree with this. For one thing, the three books are very distinct and function almost as stand alone novels... at least books 1 and 2.   but more so, combining all three into one book would be a really long book. Like 900 at least? I think the LOTR books are about 1100, for comparison's sake, and they were published as 3.   Granted, sometimes epic fantasy tomes like Dance with Dragons or The Stand are that long, but I think it's plenty fair to break up books that have distinct feels into 200-350 page works.   ETA: Also worth noting that there is a hardcover version with all three books a single volume.    Homeland by Sam Lipsyte  Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams   As a "job"? Almost impossible.   As a gig that pays like maybe 50 bucks a review? Possible.   As a hobby where you don't get paid? That's very easy.   try /r/writing though   There's a lot to respond to here, but    If I have to research my own marketing like a full, no-agent self-publisher why did I even bother getting an agent in the first place?  Agents don't market books really. They sell them to publishers and it's the publisher's job (and the author's) to market. Or are you saying his agency has their own publishing house too which publishes "company" work? That's highly unusual.    try /r/writing or /r/selfpublish   Either "A stranger comes to town" or "a man goes on a journey"   I don't think that "believability" is the goal at all, that's like critiquing Lord of the Rings for not being "realistic" with all its dragons and magic.        Except as the author of the article points out, Patterson and Koontz use stock characters and plots as well but do not suffer the same derision in the public eye.  Gotta disagree totally here.   There is lots of sexism in the publishing world. I think, all else being equal, a female writer is less likely to be reviewed, less likely to be taken seriously, and less likely to be a best seller. I also think it's true that Romance is looked down upon, perhaps partly for gender reasons.   But the idea that Patterson and Koontz aren't the butts of jokes? Those are just horrible examples. There are lots of threads on this forum alone where people ask why everyone calls Patterson or Koontz hacks.   I also think it's true, as others above have pointed out, that genre may matter more than gender. male romance authors like Nicholas SParks are constantly mocked. OTOH, female authors in other genres (Rowling, Flynn, Tartt, whoever you want to name) are hardly automatically looked down upon.   Does Koontz get less mockery than Roberts? Maybe, but it's like saying Shaq is short because Yao Ming is taller. It makes zero sense to say that Koontz or Patterson (or Dan Brown or a dozen other widely mocked popular authors) get a "free pass"   Patterson and Koontz are the butts of tuns of jokes. Patterson is known as a fiction factory with ghostwriters.  And how many Dan Brown jokes are out there?   nice! It gets crazier and crazier   The question of whether contests are worth it monetarily is one thing. I never enter because the entry fees add up quickly. 20 bucks, but you probably need to enter 30 contests to win one, so suddenly 500 bucks for maybe a $400 prize.   But to your specific question, I think that conests are MORE likely to pick relatively unknown authors than other submission things. Because most big name authors don't submit to them out of fairness and being at a different point in their career.   if you submit to say Tin House through the slush, you are competing against a ton of big name and agented authors who are submitting work. But if you submit to a contest, those authors won't be entering and you are only competiting against emerging writers.          Gene Wolfe is one of the best. Book of the New Sun series is essential SF reading         It's so hard, because you are always going up against the whole of literature in a sense, right? Like why read my work when you could read Tolstoy or Tolkien?   But we gotta push through it            Wow, crazy. I did honors english but our reading list was all lit canon (Crime and Punishment, Wuthering Heights, etc.)   Wow really? I can't imagine any high school teaching The Stand! (In part because of the length). I certainly never had any King in HS.    Yes, as others said I'd get a job, any kind of job, as quick as possible. Writing takes time--both to write and to pitch and to get your forms processed and then to get paycheck. Even if you are lucky enough to get a paying gig somewhere, you are looking at a couple months from start to paycheck... for probably 50 bucks.   You could try looking into copywriting or copyediting gigs for something more steady.                         We can stop talking about it when working writers whose work is desired by consumers start making living wages  (and, yes, if tons of people are pirating books to read they desire those books)   What the other people said.   The smallish (but really thick) paperbacks you see in grocery stores that have like the author's name embossed in giant letters (DEAN KOONTZ! etc.) and have thin, flimsy paper and covers are mass market paperbacks.   The normal paperbacks you buy in bookstores are trade paperback.   Mass market is mostly limited to commerical fiction: romances, thrillers, etc.    It's discussed on here a lot, I'm sure you can find threads on it   Blood Meridian (help me remember that never seeing humans might not be such a bad thing)      Tropic of War (Book One)    haha, or like a memoir of a Chilean psychologist trying to treat really angry  patients       In my experience there is no qualitative difference between self published and traditionally published books.  Could you list a few self-published books that you think are of equal quality to the great works of "trad" publishing from the same time span. Say, that are of equal quality to the Booker, NBA, Pulitzer winners?     I've never really understood the hate towards self-published fiction. Why is it in writing that people hate it? You don't see the same hate directed at Indie games, films and amateur radio and a lot of that can end up rubbish.  Well, there are a few things here I think.   First off: "indie" in other genres is closer to independent/small press publishing. "indie" record labels are still record labels that operate similar to big ones but on a smaller scale. "indie" studios have to raise cash and finance films. So they are like indie presses: Tin House, Graywolf, Mcsweeney's, etc.   In all those cases, there are still quality controls and a barrier to entry. Lots of high quality work comes from indie presses, indie films, and indie games.   Self-publishing--as opposed to indie publishing/small press publishing--has zero barriers, zero quality control, and just an infinite flood of work. I've read over a million books are self-published each year. The closest thing I can think of in another medium is like youtube videos, but people make plenty fun of those too... and youtube video people don't really expect to become famous artists from it.   On top of that, self-publishing authors--not all, but many--tend to annoy everyone else in the publishing world because they harass everyone with links, spam, emails begging for reviews, tweets to Amazon links, etc. My friends in publishing are bombarded by self-publishing spam every day. I get it, because when you have 1 million self-published books to compete against you are going to be desperate to stand out and to get readers. But it is part of why people look down on that world.           but to me the bigger problem is about adequate discovery.  These aren't unrelated though. Discoverability is harder when there are 1 million self-published ebooks coming out each year. (That's a real estimate I've seen)   Anything from zero to millions. Really depends on the author.   Generally speaking, most literary authors don't make any money in royalties per se. Authors get an "advance" against royalties before the book comes out, and most of the time the author doesn't earn out the advance so they don't get more than that.   Nowadays, the average advance is somewhere between 5 and 20 thousand for a small time author at a Big 5 house. Big name authors get much more though.             I'm just skeptical that happens. I mean, I've watched dozens of friends have debut books. Many have multiple now. They didn't lose all their struggling writer friends.       I'm skeptical of the idea you lose all your friends. She says that, then doesn't explain why or say that happened to her.                love going to SF book stores to look at old pulp covers                  You said collection (not collecting) society in lowercases. Thought you were maybe using a term for welfare state I hadn't heard used.   	200

Communism requires adequate systems to ensure fair distribution of resources. Current level of society in the US still dictates that the needs of the many outweigh those of the individual. Once you get an adequate equilibrium going between the individual and community, like in some European countries, it actually works pretty well. e.g. high taxes but great health-care. In those countries, the incentive for personal gain by harming others is far more limited while risk remains the same. But where the return far outweighs the risk, like here, then there is far more incentive to be selfish.   something.   You have 1 notification.   standing on a wall    Tehruhhrrees.   Love.

You're a minuscule speck in the universe of commerce and capitalism around you, a simple vibration of an atom would render you bankrupt. That's not for lack of trying either; if a bad thing happens, it doesn't really matter what you do, you're going down. Just be thankful that money is all you can lose in this country.   On the flip side, it's also why you get to become gloriously rich if you succeed. Because you're leveraging on the failures of everyone else who didn't. GDP doesn't grow fast enough for everyone to succeed on their own merits. And if you think you're controlling the failures of everyone else in your hand, you need to double check your privilege.

In any case, pretty sure they already raise their overall prices by single digit percentages every year.     	170
 Super sharp white cheddar cheese and cherry Capri Sun.   Outside where I went to school (both middle and high) was an extensive network of fountains. It was tradition on the last day of school to throw your friends in the water. It was also tradition that once they were picked up by your posse, you emptied their pockets and took off their shoes.   My first time round, at the end of 7th grade, a boy pushed me into the water without taking such precautions. I'm sure it was a juvenile attempt at flirtation. My new cellphone (it was Japan, everyone had cellies) was in my pocket and got ruined. It was a Christmas present from my parents and I really treasured it, so I didn't want them to think I didn't care for my nice things...so I made him go tell my parents. I think he even wrote a note in which he managed to apologize a multitude of times - I remember my dad finding it absolutely hilarious. The young man moved that summer and I never saw him again.    **WARNING: RAMBLING ART POST AHEAD**  I am an (assistant) curator at an art museum, where *many* of my colleagues are artists. Many of them are quite successful in the local art scene. Every one of them still keeps their day job. It's not even be an issue of marketing. The fact of the matter is, that most artists, but especially drawings don't earn big art money, even when you can market and sell them well. Even masters' drawings don't comparatively sell for a lot. A recent Picasso drawing [sold for $123,750 at Christie's](http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/drawings-watercolors/pablo-picasso-deux-personnages-et-tete-5678112-details.aspx?from=searchresults intObjectID=5678112 sid=f2dd6a3f-ab0c-495b-a096-df2efccb3001). Which, granted is not chump change. But compare that to the [$106.5 million one of his paintings sold for in 2010](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/arts/06iht-melik6.html?_r=0).   So I clearly understand that your friend is not Picasso, but go ahead and google "ink drawings for sale," and you'll probably find plenty of places selling prints. People who make money drawing make prints, because you can take your hours and hours of work and then sell it many times for a small(er) amount of money. If you're wise, an amount of money that the Average Joe is willing to shell out an an art fair, say $25-50 for an 8x10. Less for greeting cards.  The other thing is subject matter and the idea of an artist. Most people now-a-days think of the artist as a true, pure, creative soul unburdened by the practicalities of the world. This is a *fairly* recent concept, and throughout most of history artists were considered and considered themselves more like craftsmen. And like craftsmen, they were dependent on commissions and patrons. Most artists were **told** what to draw. Artists today can certainly do that. But I think savvy artists can take advantage of an existing market. Take a look at top etsy and deviantart sellers, they create art from fan-favorite shows, sports teams, universities, etc. People love to buy pretty art representing things they already love.   So, for the unsolicited advice to nobody in particular: If you want to make money drawing, make beautiful drawings of the favorite historic building downtown or at your local university. Make prints, put it on mousepads and coffee mugs and greeting cards. Sell it at local stores. Frame the original and sell it for 10-15x the asking price of the print.   You still might have to keep your day job.   He is very talented though. :)   The tickets have been claimed, thanks!   Hey Pittsburgh! I just received two tickets at my workplace (out of the blue) to the [Silk Screen Asian American Film Festival](http://www.silkscreenfestival.org/). Only problem is, I live in Cincinnati and have no plans to make it out to Pittsburgh in the coming week! The festival is from Today (May 10th) through the 19th. They are $10 face value, and are good for admission to any film presentation at the Regent Square Theater, Melwood Screening Room, or the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. It does say it is not valid for special events.  If anyone would like these two tickets, I will gladly send them to you in the mail - just PM your address!   Please tell me this is called, [The Colors of the Wind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diQgSDWJL7o)   There are a myriad of reasons why its happened over the centuries. Many early medieval manuscripts were cut up in the later medieval period to provide scrap material for the creation of new manuscripts (paste down pages and binding strips, etc.). Essentially they were using old-fashioned codices to create fancy new ones. Useful, in their eyes, especially as vellum was costly. Some of these fragments have been preserved because they were used in this way! This continued on for a long time.   Nowadays, it still happens as rare book dealers can get a greater amount of money by breaking up a book rather than selling it complete. The best example of this is the Audubon Double-Elephant folio. Double-Elephant is a reference to the size of the paper. Audubon wanted to render the birds as life-size. So the large paper format allowed him to fit in the larger birds - many are [craning their necks to fit in the page.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_U3smsd2mIlI/TMOBcAE-H9I/AAAAAAAAEKs/W1QC8zBbafA/s1600/American_Flamingo.jpg) He then issued these out as a series to subscribers. Not every subscriber went the full length of subscription, so a full set is fairly rare to begin with. The most recent set sold at auction for $11.5 million. Now, dealers will get a hold of these volumes and obviously want to make as much money as possible. So, instead of trying to find *one* buyer willing to spend $11 mill., they will find *many* buyers who are willing to spend some thousands to buy a *leaf* from the folio. Some of the large birds can go quite high, into the six figures. And often, when you add up the sale price of all of these individual prints, it will exceed the cost of the complete set. The prints are highly desirable as individual plates also, because they are easier for collectors to display and look great on a wall.   I agree that it is awful. You should try and preserve things as much as possible. Some of the early stuff though happened 800+ years ago, and it's hard to get angry about it. It is part of the object's history and often is very enlightening to the period. The manuscript you looked at is very fine and quite complete - this isn't your typical example! There are tons of fragments and single leaves that can also be beautiful and illuminating.  For a fairly detailed analysis of the price break-down on Audubon's folios: http://blog.audubonart.com/?p=81   I just wrote a lengthy response to /u/element4l about my specific path. It was both a combination of education and practical experience.    Oh and I forgot to mention this in the tome I wrote above, but be aware of the programs. Frankly ranking and regard of program are considerations. At least in the United States, to work in any library you must have your MLS. This is somewhat problematic as there are wildly divergent needs at different types of libraries. Rare books and university librarians do generally need the rigor of a Master's program to best serve their patrons. Generally speaking, public librarians, school librarians, etc. shouldn't necessarily need a Masters degree. The perpetual complaint of reference librarians at many of these institutions is that they never actually answer reference questions - just where the bathroom is. Because of these disparate needs, there are many programs that cater more specifically to the latter group. If you are serious about Rare Books, Archives, or Museum work - you need to find a top program that has highly regarded specialties in your chosen field. For MLS programs, you need to look at the top tier and really investigate their specialty programs.   Thanks! I certainly think so! :)   Thanks! I find it to be - I absolutely love what I do. I wrote a very long response to /u/element4l above. Short story is that it's a life-long passion that I worked quite hard for.    Yes! Sorry for the out of the blue reference. It's very lightweight but quite durable. It's almost translucent. It was used a lot for carbon copies and for air mail correspondence (light weight = cheaper) in the past, so you do run across it a lot in manuscript collections.    Well, I will say it was a lot of hard work and a good dash of luck. I'm happy to share my story though. I absolutely love my job. I will give a word of warning that as you are already in you mid-twenties, you many have a steep road ahead of you. But nothing is impossible! This will be somewhat long!  **1. Education** When I was an undergraduate I majored in History and Medieval Studies - a very interdisciplinary field that has served me well in both graduate school and my career. I then continued on to obtain my Master's in Library Science with a specialization in rare books and manuscripts. You can major in anything and go to Library school. There are also Museum studies programs that typically require an art history or history background, which can also be good options. Pay attention in your classes and develop relationships with professors in fields you are passionate about. When they know you really care about what you are doing, most professors are happy to help you in any way. Sit down and chat with them one-on-one. I went to a school that had very small class sizes and professors really cultivated student relationships which was wonderful. Ask them for advice. And yes, go talk to curators if you can. Start at your university's museum if they have one. We're busy folk, so you might not always get a response out of the blue. Try going to smaller museums in person and seeing if someone has the time to show you around and talk about their path. Everyone's is certainly not identical to mine.  **2. Language** A big part of what helped me to get where I am is languages. I grew up in Japan and learnt Japanese, I then picked up Anglo-Saxon/Old English and Latin in college. Both of these helped me to be somewhat proficient in both Germanic and Romance languages, respectively. If you don't have a foreign language, start one today. Pick something that interests you and that pertains to the field in which you are most passionate. I learned dead languages because the objects I work with are written in them. If you are passionate about Greek art you better speak Greek. It is discouraging to many, but you will be a much better curator and you will be far more interesting to future employers with language skills.   **3. Practical Experience** When I was an undergraduate I worked in my university's library, just at the circulation desk, but was able to get some shifts in the very small rare books reading room from time to time. The minute I got to graduate school, I went to the rare books library and told them, "I want to work here, I'll do anything." Which worked, I was able to get an entry-level position that then allowed me to advance in the ranks. While at graduate school, I did an internship with the curator of Manuscripts. I was able to time this well that I worked from start to finish on an exhibition of 100 medieval manuscripts. Also in this project we published a fully illustrated catalogue that was written by the leading expert in the field. I learned so much not only in terms of manuscript studies, but publishing, exhibition design, interdepartmental cooperation, and more.   **4. Attitude and Decorum and Getting Your Foot in the Door**  I cannot tell you how important a willing and cheerful attitude is. And not just when you are getting to handle the beautiful pieces. This is very important and I think would serve many people well, not just in the arts - **you have to be willing to do bitch work.** I know so many people who feel that it is beneath them to *insert menial task here* because they have a *insert higher degree here.* I have never had that mentality and always been a type of person who will pitch in to make things happen. I have quickly made myself a reliable and dependable person who is willing to just about anything to get the job done. Again, when I first started working at the rare books library, it wasn't anything glamorous - I essentially sat at a desk and made sure patrons didn't go into closed off areas. Was it bitch work? Yes. Did it require the amount of education I had already amassed? No. Did I whine about it? Absolutely not. I was happy to be there. And I met and became friends with everyone on staff. So two months later when a reference position opened up, guess who was at the top of the list to be promoted? THIS GIRL. I also made a point to dress professionally, even when it was not mandated. Most of the other student workers would wear normal casual clothes - t-shirts, jeans, etc. I never did and I noticed that I generally got treated more seriously by both staff and patrons. A second story to drive the point home: when I graduated I was job hunting and moved to a new city (for various reasons). Again, I went, *in person* and offered my services to even volunteer at a museum. They didn't have an open position but I began to volunteer a few times a week. (I was working other places at the time to support myself.) A few months later, an assistant curator position was funded, and having plenty of connections and friends at the museum I was able to easily get an interview and was hired.  I hope this helps answer some of your questions! If this generated more, please ask.    These programs are typically designed for someone going into a more traditional conception of librarianship. This would not be useful for someone interested in archives or rare book librarianship (different things, mind you!), both fields where practical experience with the physical objects is very highly regarded.    Thanks! I love what I do, and I both worked incredibly hard, but I also got very lucky.   In undergraduate I majored in History and Medieval Studies - very interdisciplinary study which helped me greatly in graduate school and in my career.   I also picked up a number of languages. I grew up in Japan where I learned Japanese. In college I studied Anglo-Saxon/Old English and Latin (both of which open doors to later Germanic and Romance languages, respectively).   I obtained my Masters in Library Science, with a specialty in rare books and manuscripts. I went to a school that has a very highly regarded rare books library and program. Many Library schools don't have this, and a general MLS will typically not serve you well. Also, rare book library/museum work really values having worked with the art objects themselves.  Upon starting my program, I was able to get a job at the rare books library where I was able to work with amazing materials every day. I also got an internship in which I worked one-on-one with the Curator of Manuscripts. From start to finish on the creation of an exhibition and catalogue of medieval manuscripts.   Upon graduation it was a combination of this practical experience, education, languages, plus a good dash of being in the right place at the right time that helped me get my current job as an assistant curator at an art museum.    It's certainly not the worst sin in the pantheon of rare books. For a fascinating and agonizing read, get a copy of [Cutting up Manuscripts for Pleasure and Profit](http://www.amazon.com/Cutting-up-manuscripts-pleasure-profit/dp/B0006QLXZ4).    Gesso is a form of sizing, which is a broad category which (at least in terms of gilding in manuscripts) refers to any substance which aids gold in adhering to the surface of the page. In medieval manuscripts in Western Europe gesso was far and away the most common. In early manuscripts, you do see other adhesives being used. The 'flatter' gold here, in the foliate border, is probably more likely to be shell gold, which is powdered gold that was mixed with gum arabic, creating a gold ink. The initials are still likely to have a gesso base.    First off, I'm a rare books librarian/curator whose specialty is medieval manuscripts. What other people have said regarding the use of gloves is absolutely true. Generally, most constrain your dexterity to be compromised with gloves, which is a big concern when turning pages of books or letters ( especially onion skin!). This, however, is not the case in every library, and you should always follow the rules of the institution.   Another facet of vellum/parchment is that your hands can actually be beneficial. Vellum/parchment is untanned animal skin that has been treated in various ways. It is, in some ways, akin to leather. And just as leather is improved by periodic conditioning, so too is parchment. The natural oils in your hands can help to keep the parchment supple. Makes sure you don't have heavy lotions though. You must, however, be *very careful* to not touch any of the ink, pigment, or gold. This is much more sensitive. Just watch your  hands OP, that gold is very delicate! Its microns thick and applied to a layer of gesso (a chalk like substance).   edit: I accidentally a word.   The key would be that we're talking about a great-grandfather. For most reddit users, their great-grandfathers were probably born in the late 19th century or early 20th. Most rural locales did not get electricity until later in the 20th. My own grandfather (not even great, mind you), grew up on a farm in Tennessee and remembers when they had their first lightbulb - probably in the mid-to-late 1930s. Given that this great-grandpappy was a rancher in Texas, they probably didn't have a electricity or a telephone and probably just rode his horse to visit his friends.   I think I remember the place! Never tried it though - I always saved my stomach space for [MOMIJI MANJU](http://i.imgur.com/SdFROwK) when heading to Miyajima!    Fellow Kobe-jin! Give me Kansai-style or give me death! Also, where's the mayo??    I want to shower you with sugar lumps, and ride you over fences!   We got a product called 'stimulo' which is essentially a tray with short tubes in which you put food. It helps the cat too slow down and simulates their kitty brains. But this should also be combined with portion control   I believe that it is actually a tenor recorder! I was in an early music consort in college, and they get even bigger (contra-bass are huge!); I never played on public transport though...   So, is there a subreddit for those sleeping with their cousins?? There's certainly enough of you.    The real question is how Patrick Stewart got a hold of the Cup of Christ after it fellow in the crevasse.   Glad to hear you're in agreement! Peer review is a wonderful thing.   First off, I'm a rare book librarian/curator that specializes in Medieval Manuscripts. The notation method is known as [neumes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumes), the predecessor to our modern musical notation. It appears as early as the 9th century, though this is obviously much later. To my eye this is definitely mid-15th century. It is written on vellum/parchment, and has been repaired with the same.   You had a picture of the "interesting repair work"...this is some vellum from a smaller (in actual size) codex; you can tell from the line of prickings along the edge. [Parchment would be folded and pricked](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0akEes4NNw), that way, when the scribe was writing out the lines of text - they would be in a uniform spot throughout the codex. It looks like they got prick happy with the rest of the corner and ended up using it as repair spot.  The stitching was fairly common in poor quality vellum. When you create vellum/parchment it involves stretching the skin very tautly on a frame and then scraping it with a mezzaluna knife to remove skin, hair, etc. To an inexperienced maker, they can easily rip holes. Sometimes, they occur naturally - perhaps a cut on the animal prior to death. While finishing the vellum, they would sew up the holes and you can often see it in manuscripts. Sometimes scribes would [even write around the stitching or existing hole.](http://library.osu.edu/blogs/rarebooks/files/2008/12/gui_mss-hole.jpg). [Here's one where the stitching has fallen out or disintegrated over the years](http://library.osu.edu/blogs/rarebooks/files/2008/12/gui_mss-hole.jpg).   This is an old binding, but not original. The main reason I can tell is that your text block has been trimmed. If you look on your first illumination page, you can see where the top is cut off. I would also say that this might only be part of the original book. 120 pages seems quite short for an Antiphoner of that size. I wouldn't be able to tell for sure though without examining it more closely and whipping out some collational formulas. Don't worry, this is very, very common with old codices. If I were to guess at this point on the binding without examining it, I would say that it probably 16th-17th century.   Lastly, for the time being, I don't know who your friend talked to, but this is worth far more than a few hundred. Just the fact that you have (at least) a partial codex it's worth much more than that. It's frankly, not in *great* physical condition, but I've certainly seen worse. Unless the dealer thought it was fake, I see absolutely no reason why he would quote them such a low price. And to my eye, it looks genuine.     It was a hell of a play!    OH AND CHAMPAGNE. You can get champagne. Chicks dig it when you give them champagne.    Also, pro tip, bring some cash to get chocolate from Divine's at the intermission. Most things are only a few bucks - a wide selection from chocolate covered pretzel rods (white, milk, dark) to fancy shmancy truffles.  	31
 GC1QDBW         How are they so satisfying?! I'm mesmerised.    I thought they were protecting one another from each other by handing in the guns inside the walls.    I had never seen a stair lift in action, I am unbelievably satisfied.    Ah yes I guess. I presumed they'd just taken the knives from the kitchen in their houses.   Seems ironic they made them give up their guns when a large majority of their kills are from knives or other random objects.    Can someone please tell me, why didn't Daryl have to turn in his crossbow?   Did you speak to her after that?      	10
 Gurps is an RPG without seatbelts. It's possible for any player to derail the game through any number of ways.    Be interesting to see what impact this has on the situation there.   Well the question to ask is: without bombing civilian targets, would the war have lasted longer and cost even more lives? Or, perhaps more difficult: would bombing *this or that* civilian target have shortened the war?   I just don't know the answer to that, sadly.   captive piston ammunition has always kind of fascinated me. It's such an interesting concept.    How many times can you go to the same well, with the same bucket, and get the same water, and pass it off as amazing?   I dunno that the premise of scream would necessarily make a great one for a TV show, unless it was almost like a police procedural or something.   People sobbing and moaning today about a few people killed in a drone strike have no clue how we used to incinerate entire cities just to slow down military production.    Yeah cause a giant monument is totally the same thing as a book, right?   The lengths people go to defend their racist, traitorous bullshit is absolutely fucking astounding to me.    Yep. They eat an *enormous* amount of bird species and put tremendous pressure on them. Neuter and release programs do nothing about that problem; they just make people feel better.      Very peculiar. If he genuinely did not get to the high school then that'd indicate an abduction took place between his house and the school - a difficult scenario to imagine at that hour of the day and with a healthy 19 year old male.   My best guess would be that someone who knew him (or at least, that he knew of in some way) got him, considering time of day and all. Maybe they stopped to offer him a ride to the school and something just went south from there.   The only thing i can say with certainty looking at that thing, is that it is ugly as the day is long. Reminds me of a puffin or something.   Korea is a pretty messed up place in a lot of ways.    i don't see a collar on it, it was roaming around someone's back yard. That sounds feral to me.    I'd believe it. They certainly did me - i'll probably never vote republican again, unless things *significantly* change.   No doubt, right? I mean at least robin was with someone who was non-lethal; i don't recall captain america being particularly non-lethal in how he dealt with people.    I'm *continually* baffled by people who are like "oh man feral cats deserve love!" - their fuckin' feral cats! They kill birds, they kill small wildlife, their a blight on neighborhoods.    I'm reading my way through "I could love you if you let me" on archiveofourown and i already liked the pairing but now i'm in love with it and i am now *incredibly* excited.    Bucky looks like a little kid. That's kind of disturbing in it's own right.   I strongly suspect this thing will never get (hah!) very far off the ground with the military. The advantages it brings aren't worth the cost, maintenance, and training issues it has. Not to mention, i'm not sure where something like this would even fit, doctrine-wise.   Well, see, when you are REALLY GOOD with a hammer, suddenly every problem is a nail that no one's understood is a nail yet.   I almost hope it's true. The thought of pro-lifers being forced into hiding and shame for fear of the judgement of their peers brings a smile to my face.   It's so inexplicable that i felt it kind of elevated itself to being news. Most animal abuse cases don't involve multiple animals or this level of mutilation.  Whoever did this is very sick and needs to be found quickly.      Pretty awesome, i wonder if it'd be able to save updates to the drive at some point?   That was actually the variety of conservatism i grew up with. The people i was around genuinely did not care about who married who or what church someone went to. The idea of imposing religious and moral values onto people was just not something they were into.  No clue what happened to those guys.       "It's a fucking meat grinder. People go in one end, and meat comes out the other. All we do is turn the handle. " - Judge Lex, Dredd      I've always viewed feral cats as a serious problem that should be dealt with on the harshest terms. If people love their cats - great, get'em neutered and keep'em inside.   I think it's under-rated. It's about 8 times as good as the poltergeist remake, at least.   "it's about time" also leapt to mind. I don't know why there'd even be such an exemption.   it's for sure pretty tasteless.      That's how i feel about it. Feral cats are vermin and keeping their numbers down is a responsibility that we, as humans, have.    that's impressive, i like that.   [A more information-full story about the incident itself from when ti happened.](http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/18/us/texas-veterinarian-facebook-cat-shot/) Includes a better picture of the cat shot - looks like she got it almost perfectly in the back of the head.  If i recall it was in her back yard, so it was at fairly close range - still, i mean from a technical stand point it was a pretty impressive shot.      This is a tragedy and an injustice. This monument to a traitor shouldn't be vandalized, it should be bulldozed into the dirt and something useful built on it's location.      Trust me, this is 100% the best time to be alive by an enormous margin.  [Check out just the year 1915](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1915) - World War I was kicking off (and people were dying by the droves), and it's only 3 years until the [1918 flu pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic) kicks off - and kills *3% to 6% of the entire fucking world*.   No, anyone who tells you "oh man the 21st century is awful" just doesn't know history very well.   Yeah, that was pretty despair-inducing.    The advantage of any concealed weapon is that you need not necessarily be faster than the other guy; it's that he'll let his guard down (thinking you're unarmed) and you'll have a free shot at him because of this.   In terms of effectiveness, sword canes are just not very good weapons. Even the super mallnina's at cold steel [have a hard time making them look effective.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL0Y-GhU2Io)    I post a lot on /r/news but to me /r/morbidreality will always sort of be my "home" on reddit. The people here really are a cut above the rest in terms of thoughtfulness, consideration, and decency.   Lots of people go through horrific abuse and never hurt another soul. Lots more go through horrific abuse and only ever do minor harm to anyone. Our lives aren't train tracks that we're stuck on until we derail; their more like a road that we can choose to go off of, difficult as it may be.    i 3 foster parents. I hope to one day be one, for troubled older kids.    One thing that always seems to surprise people is how long the wheels of justice actually take to reach their final destination. I'm just surprised it didn't take longer.   After a quick glance, i couldn't find anything on how the kid's doing. I'm assuming it's alive since no one got charged with murder, but that's a risky assumption in some ways.   WTF else would you call them? they are people who theorize about conspiracies. It'd be natural to call them "conspiracy theorists" (or perhaps "Conspiracy Speculators" or something).    these sorts of situations aren't unheard of - [The Glen Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Ridge_rape) case comes to mind.   FPH was just a thinly veiled pro-ana site. And that some of the former users get so defensive about that tells me i'm on the right track with it.      it's almost like defense spending is horrifically inefficient and poorly managed.    I think that it's always possible for people to go to far with anything.   On the other hand, if a case does not get media attention, does not get people involved, then it is very possible for it to simply fade into the background for years as new cases come up and leads dry up.  I think Natural Born Killers said it best: "The media is like the weather, only it's man-made weather." - and online sleuthing is certainly a type of media.    As an aside, i'm both surprised that the Jessica Chambers case has gone unsolved this long, and that it's not much more popular in the media. She fits their ideal of a victim: young, blonde, american, pretty.    Since i didn't see it yet: Any situation where people are withholding large amounts of information/not answering questions/avoiding explaining things? Yeah, that's probably not going to work out well.  Another big one (and a related one) is one where people refuse to "get close" to you. If you move into an apartment or you start a job and *no one* is friendly? That's a red flag, they have a reason for acting like that, and it's probably not something you want to be around to learn about.   I'm just trying to envision something more awkward than playing a strategy game on a phone.   Some thoughts on each entry:  1. amusingly, clive barker's "Scarlet Gospels" have totally and utterly confused the issue of who pinhead is and what he wants.  2. Peter Watts did a great short story called "The Things" that talks about the mindset of the creature, and how it is, in truth, just doing what it does and isn't really evil per se. My own favorite theory is that the time in the ice gave it brain damage, and it was operating at a much reduced, bestial capacity; it's normal mode of operation must have been much higher, to build spaceships and all.  3. Dekker's kind of a mixed bag as a villian. On the one hand he's definitely evil, on the other hand that evil is serving a slightly greater good (for the moment, at least).  4. the Predator (or Yautja) are actually text-book evil to me. Their totally selfish, self-centered, and ignorant to the validity of other ways of living and other lives.   5. Vampires have always been sort of the prototype "monster-victim". Their monsters, yes - but only because of circumstance. Of course, they can embrace their dark nature. One thing i liked about the Twilight franchise is that it shows two types of vampires: those that sort of accept this "gift" and fit in with humans as best they can, and those that just go full on psycho-dark.    well you know what they say - you want people to give a shit about your horrific murder, it helps to be pretty, blonde, female, and american. I doubt the people looking into it are going anywhere, regardless of likelihood of success.    fuckin' autocorrect.   I wish'em luck. My guess is their not going to uncover anything of note because whoever did this is obviously being protected by the people who know they did it.    my general attitude is that with modern technology, there is pretty much never a time that a high speed chase is the correct answer. The risks to bystanders are to high, the risk of harm to police and the suspect are to high, the risk of property damage is to high. If a suspect is of a mind to run, just let'em run and catch up with them later.         they also sell it the other way around.  Now, i'm not necessarily against brass-knuckle style handguards, but i gotta think a hammer's not the ideal place to put one. At all.    Sure, was kind of big news a few months ago:  [Article 1](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/01/us-usa-pennsylvania-chainsaw-idUSKBN0MS4WR20150401)  [Article 2](http://crimefeed.com/2015/04/pennsylvania-teen-comes-home-find-parents-mutilated-chainsaw-murder-suicide/)   [Article 3](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/chainsaw-murder-suicide-pa-man-hacks-wife-coroner-article-1.2170005)   For me it's all about family. The gods are a distant, unattainable sort of notion; my ancestors are something i can identify with.    i gotta say, i'm so jaded by sword canes that if i saw a person with a cane that was not obviously purely therapeutic, i would assume it was a sword cane.    /r/worldnews is fucking appalling. It's one of the very few subs i've considered unsubbing from because of how incredibly toxic and obnoxious the userbase is.   I used to hate /r/news content, so now i post the content i wish was being posted there. To moderate success. The problem isn't the users, it's the posters who post gigatons of shit-news about bullshit.   Life's about more than money.   That was my thought, too. I mean usually when i see something awful like this i figure the guy was blitzed out of his mind on meth or drunk or something. To know he was sober? That's just chilling.   I ain't sure i'd want to eat near a shooting range - i'd be concerned about lead contamination.   that you think the modern government has any bearing on why i think the confederates are scumbags says a great deal more about you than me.         It's pretty trippy to think about, because the comic acts like they've been together forever, even though in story time it's only been a few weeks at most.   Snowden's not a traitor. A traitor has to act with intent to harm the country or to aid our enemies. He didn't intend to harm the country, but merely to draw attention to it's policies.  I consider much of the actions of our intelligence agencies to be anti-american in nature, and certainly something that goes against our values as a country.   Bet those'll be collectors items soon.      Would i have memorials celebrating the lives and deeds of traitors against my country removed? Why yes, yes i would. Maybe i'd build a memorial on the site to the innocent people they killed for their own selfish reasons, instead.      I wish texas would secede, they could stop being a national embarrassment for us.   Damn straight Robert E. Lee is a traitor. That so many buildings bear his name is a shame.   And certainly we were traitors to the throne of britain; I consider it a necessary and just betrayal, but a betrayal none the less. For that reason i'd not expect britain to build monuments to our great revolutionary war heroes, nor would i expect them to name buildings after them! Actually i gather that in the UK, the revolution is small potatoes because at that time in history britain was involved in a much larger conflict, and it was basically a footnote in that.    Found the guy with a traitor for a great-great grandfather. Do ya'll still own the plantation, or did you have to sell it off once you couldn't shore it up with slave labor anymore?      I wonder how much time in-universe has passed in 2 years real time - i bet it's not very long.   I just wonder what the daily life was like before this; were there any warning signs or was it just a gradual buildup until this happened?   indeed so, it was an absolutely unimaginable betrayal. Something on the order of *2%* of the entire country died during the war; it was a staggering and almost incomprehensible waste of life and potential.   To do anything to honor or memorialize these traitors is disturbing and disgusting, and affront to all those who died because of their treachery.    But then who'll fleece tourists with the "we caught a snake and are going to kill it unless you buy it off us to set it free" gambit?   I think it's a boat-burning effort. By committing atrocities, they make it less likely governments will negotiate with their fighters to surrender, making it more likely they'll keep fighting instead.      I don't consider the vast majority of mass shootings to be terrorism, but i would say charleston fits the bill. He attacked civilians with the hope of achieving a political end (a race war, no less). That's practically terrorism defined.    A lifetime of therapy in his future, i'd think. Walking in on your dad stabbed to death by his own hand while your mother lays dead - that's not something that's going away.   Confederate soldiers were no more americans than a cockroach is an american. They were traitors who took up arms against their brothers - betrayers and thieves and brigands. Nothing more than that.   that's a tragedy. It should say something that emphasizes that the confederates were ignorant traitors and that building memorials to them is like building a memorial to the dog shit on your shoe.       No sweat, you might also be interested in [Opus Dei](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Opus_Dei) - their a large (92,000) member organization of particularly devoted catholics. Their known for their secrecy and strict rules.   i check most of them every few days, i suppose, if i don't just add them to my friend feed and constantly stay up to date.   I could see a few situations that might lead to it. One would be if the catholic church was, genuinely, threatened by some external force - perhaps if terrorists targeted many priests in europe and abroad. In that case the "crusade" might be in the form of guards for churches and priests, rather than a traditional one.  Another big one might be if a country launched an attack on the vatican, and (for whatever reason) the rest of the world refused to sanction them for it. A firebrand pope (or one who was deranged because of the attack) could call for it.   It'd be a big (even huge) deal, and not something the church would take lightly, or that the world would sit idly by for. The only question would be if anyone cared enough to try and stop them (or if the risks of stopping them outweighed the likelyhood of further uprisings).   Intriguingly, there are still a few knight orders left - the [Knights Hospitaller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Hospitaller) are still kicking around, along with [a few others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_order_(monastic_society%29#List_of_military_orders) - they could see a resurgence (and rearming).   As a side note, if a group as disordered as islam can have *several* on-going, persistent military operations, someone as organized as the catholic church could certainly manage one.   No more server busy errors, better integration with other types of media (email + google plus + youtube); probably we could start using google drive easily to host files, which might be pretty exciting; shared and collaboratively edited documents would be a godsend for places like /r/futurewhatif or /r/worldbuilding  I think it'd be a net postive, we'd lose some users but gain some users.   We'd have to make a few assumptions - the biggest one being he has some reason or motivation behind calling the crusade that's reasonably compelling. it's not just "hey let's roll" it's "because of these reasons, we must take up arms and defend Christendom itself!"   People would answer. How many and of what quality i couldn't venture a guess, but people would answer. Probably enough to mount a fairly serious expedition somewhere; definitely enough to run a guerrilla war.  if they could get a country on board (say, brazil or italy) they could do some *serious* damage to someone.   Either way, true believers will flock to such a cause, regardless of how crazy it might seem in hindsight.   It's kind of a big checkov's gun - i'm curious to see how it plays into things. She's got more knives on her than most people own!    Shit, why not build a statue of hitler? he killed less americans than that traitorous fuck Davis did.    A fucking weird case with a fucking weird conclusion.         when someone's legit to scummy for reddit, they should assess their fucking life choices.   As with so many who feel regret, he was ok at first but just took it a little to far - and that's when it punished him.   what could possibly go wrong with that plan.   if you can pull stuff out with hoppers, you could use this as a god-forsaken form of storage buffer...   rumor has it that when they fully reverse engineered and comprehended McAfee, six men went insane and another four were never able to look at a computer again. It was *that bad*.    I don't have any problem with the guy refusing service to anyone, provided he's up front about it. I mean i'd never shop there, but it's his store and he can do what he wants.   the entire friday the 13th TV series is about this very premise: they go around collecting cursed objects and containing them.    Cube came instantly to mind.   Looks like an awesome game! I'll have to give it a try, me and my partner are always looking for new coop games to play online; they seem a rarity.   someone could post news about nethack and some asshole would stroll in to say "not a roguelike" and then nope out again. Just the nature of the sub.   but then authors, publishers and distributors couldn't double-dip.   One advantage of having a near monopoly like walmart is if they say "we're not doing it anymore", it can just flat-out decimate the supply in some areas. This'll push confederate flag gear into flea markets and low-rent dollar stores where only the lowest-rent motherfuckers would buy it, and that's a good thing.    Tough rocks, life ain't fair.  edited to add: i'm sure it's just like every other captured soldier and defeated military in history - suddenly *no one* really wanted to be there fighting and everyone was coerced and haha, can't we just go home now, thanks?   Yeah, i'm hopeful there's some solid forensic evidence.    I gotta think people who seek to kill other people for fun are not generally the most intelligent people, or the best at long-term planning.  Like [Steven Zelich](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/steven-zelich/) - he just dumped the bodies by the side of the road, even though he had *already gotten away with the crime*. Until those bodies were found, the investigation was going nowhere into both women's disappearances.   Criminals are generally stupid.   I don't care if indexing starts at 0 or 1 or 1000, just be consistent about it.   They made a choice by joining up, they made a choice by not deserting, they made a choice by taking up arms. Whatever they get from that choice is entirely on them.    i dunno about that, but if a psycho wanted to lure people, i can't think of a much safer and easier way to do it.    didn't say he was smart.         I post the news i want people to read. If you want people to read other news, you should post it. Be the change you want to see in the world.   That's just good sense for *any* trip. Where you're going, how long you'll be back, what to do if you aren't back.   yeah people should post more bernie sanders circle jerk posts, and more obsessing over the confederate flag (of all things).    The american west would be the western part of the country, where the deserts and rocky mountains are. It's more dangerous than the eastern part, in terms of natural hazards.    I suppose it'd depend just who it was they killed. If it was a murderer or something - someone we'd sentence to death - then i have no problem with it.  Honestly, eating someone is probably less disturbing than the way funeral homes treat corpses. That shit's straight up disturbing.  But in the end we're just meat. Dust to dust, ashes to ashes, and all that - whatever happens to us after we're gone isn't nearly as important as the lives we lived. Even if we get eaten.   I gotta agree, and this is certainly something that's been born out by experience. When you have any organization that's not accountable to anyone (and effectively, that's what secrecy does), it's apt as not to end up incompetent as a result.    True that - healthy, well-adjusted people don't do murder-suicides.    Oddly enough there was another murder suicide that left a kid about that age alive, recently. I can't imagine they'll have an easy life.      I remember hearing about this kid years upon years ago, but i always just chalked it up to a fluke; somehow he got aids and just didn't spread it to anyone else.    Tell that to the guys pulling in six figures doing it.   Free room and board on the state for at least a few months would be my guess.   I only read digital books - any physical book i buy is basically a conversation piece or a display piece.       I'd assume he'd get something pretty serious for that. You really can't go around punching people in the back of the head, let alone cops.   That entropy really does always win, and that humanity really is doomed to extinction one day.    this sounds a lot like "imposter syndrome". You feel like you haven't earned your success. But i would say that since you *are* successful, you are competent and skilled in your area.  Besides - how would anyone ever find out if you *weren't* competent? If you made a mistake, you could always just blame it on external circumstances or a misunderstanding.  I guess what i'm trying to say is: Relax and enjoy the life you have, you know?         I think it's important to show the real-life aspects of things like policing. That we have cellphone video of the incident is particularly enlightening.       I think it's easy for people to get complacent. They know the trail, they know themselves, what can go wrong - and then something does go wrong, and it all falls apart. Thankfully it's really uncommon though.   It's actually pretty common for trail deaths to make news - they aren't very common, and tend to involve large search and rescue operations (like this one did).       Fair enough, but that's still way high up and probably thinner air and such. Must be a hell of a view up there.  	150
 * 30s: M (1931)        * 40s: Banshun (1949)        * 50s: Hiroshima mon amour (1959)        * 60s: Andrey Rublyov (1966)       * 70s: Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)       * 80s: Der siebente Kontinent  (1989)          * 90s: Stntang (1994)      * 00s: The Limits of Control (2009)     * 10s: Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013)         You got some general and some specific recommendations already, here's some that I would add:       * 8 (1963)       * Accattone (1961)        * I fidanzati (1963)      * I pugni in tasca (1965)        * Il deserto rosso (1964)       * Il posto (1961)        * Il vangelo secondo Matteo (1964)        * L'eclisse (1962)       * La notte (1961)        * L'avventura (1960)      * Mamma Roma (1962)    * Viaggio in Italia (1954)         Antonioni's alienation trilogy is truly amazing, I would say that especially L'eclisse (1962) is one of the best films ever made.   Someone else already mentioned Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969) by Yoshishige Yoshida, that's what I would say too. It's just sad how ignored Yoshida really is when it comes to cinema in general, many of his films are really amazing. I would love to see this one on Blu-ray.   Bringing up Baby (1938) and The Big Sleep (1946).   It's just pure aesthetic perfection, especially the framing is amazing. One of the best movies of all time too. It's also a tragedy that not a single Yoshida movie is out on Blu-ray, especially this one.   Examples of some gorgeous films:         * 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)        * Andrey Rublyov (1966)         * C'era una volta il West (1968)     * Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)      * L'eclisse (1962)         * Mujo (1970)       * Stntang (1994)         * Stalker (1979)          * Tobenai chinmoku (1966)      * Zerkalo (1975)         The bell scene in Andrey Rublyov (1966), the final duel in C'era una volta il West (1968), the hair washing scene in Zerkalo (1975) etc. There's so much stuff that's amazing.   You can use http://www.imdb.com/search/title to search for films with specific titles.   I think it's you. But to each his own.      I would suggest starting with Ivanovo detsvo (1962) and going on from there. It's a bit more accessible than his later works and a perfect start. Great movie too.   Thanks a lot for this! Now I'm waiting for The Freshman (1925), Riot in Cell Block 11 (1954) and The Complete Jacques Tati to pop up in the mail. The shipping gets quite high, especially if it's going to be delivered to Europe, but as you said, it's still a good deal. And by the way, I don't know if any of you got it too, but The Complete Jacques Tati on Blu-ray just went for CDN$ 10.39 also.   Great to see Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) on the first place, that's what I would put there too. I was just waiting for it to show up when scrolling down! Some other great choices that are top favourites from 1975 for me as well. Thumbs up for choosing films by Angelopoulos and Fassbinder too.       I'm not sure it would count though - when the film begins, he's already tied in a mobius strip isn't he? You can hear the sirens blaring past with the "dick laurent is dead" on the intercom (I know, I'm being picky here).        It was a long time ago when I saw it, but I checked a bit, and it starts with Fred Madison receiving that message on the intercom, but he isn't tied or anything, he's in his house. So yeah, it all depends on how you want to count it. The events sure are mysterious though.   You are welcome, it's a great movie! Have you seen Lost Highway (1997) by David Lynch too? If not, that would also fit the bill. Werckmeister harmnik (2000) by Bla Tarr is another recommendation.   How about Blue Velvet (1986)?   It's about eight interwoven stories, which occur in the lead-up to the 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, it's just set on the other side of the Atlantic, that's where Denmark gets in the picture.      Stntang (1994). If you mean by year.   That's Hollywood in a nutshell. Money, money, money. What were you expecting?   Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) by Chantal Akerman.   It sounds a bit like Wandfuru raifu (1998), could that be it?   The Act of Killing (2012). Make sure to watch the longer version.   * Delphine Seyrig in Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)          * Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence (1974)       * Margit Carstensen in Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)   I waited some time with Stntang (1994) (~7 hours), Shoah (1985) (~9 hours) and Out 1, noli me tangere (1971) (~12 hours), but I finally saw them. Well worth the time, all three movies. For me it's mostly been about being in the right mood, not having the time was never really a problem.   Krhozat (1988).   It could be a progressive and very interesting thing if it's done in a great way, but I don't think we can expect somethng like that from a company like Marvel. Just look at their gender roles and how women are portrayed for example.   When I first heard about Jurassic World (2015), my expectations were very low. When I saw the trailer, nothing really changed, it just confirmed my feelings. I try to not have too high expectations overall when it comes to movies, but they are mostly at their lowest when we're talking about these kind of big mainstream films from Hollywood. At this point, you typically know what to expect from them. I don't associate modern day mainstream Hollywood with cinematic masterpieces exactly.   The Wicker Man (1973) is a must watch, not a bad one at all.   I have to say Stntang (1994). I really enjoyed the movie pretty much more than the book.      Interesting reading. And interesting to hear about the parts that Satyajit Ray helped with. I have to get my hands on this one.   Doesn't get better than these:        * La jete (1962)       * Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986)       * Stalker (1979)             I posted this list in a similar thread in another subreddit. Here's 20 of my favourite movies that are 90 minutes or under that I would consider the best:            * Csillagosok, katonk (1967) (90 minutes)          * Gion bayashi (1953) (85 minutes)               * Hiroshima mon amour (1959) (90 minutes)                 * I fidanzati (1963) (77 minutes)              * Koridorius (1995) (85 minutes)             * La jete (1962) (28 minutes)             * Le rvlateur (1968) (67 minutes)                           * Les yeux sans visage (1960) (88 minutes)                    * Mouchette (1967) (78 minutes)               * Nattvardsgsterna (1963) (81 minutes)          * Nun va Goldoon (1996) (78 minutes)             * Obrazy starho sveta (1972) (70 minutes)                              * Okasareta hakui (1967) (56 minutes)             * Persona (1966) (85 minutes)             * Pickpocket (1959) (75 minutes)             * Procs de Jeanne d'Arc (1962) (65 minutes)              * Sayat Nova (1969) (79 minutes)              * Shinjuku maddo (1970) (65 minutes)             * Un homme qui dort (1974) (77 minutes)        * Une femme est une femme (1965) (85 minutes)            L'eclisse (1962). No other movie does it better.   La jete (1962) is easily the best.   Rainer Werner Fassbinder in Faustrecht der Freiheit (1975) where he plays the main role. What a guy.   I wasn't surprised the first time I read about it either. A good one! Haneke has great taste.         Double Indemnity (1944).   Yeah, me too. But I'm glad that he at least is going to make another movie.      Du rififi chez les hommes (1955).   Kuroi ame (1989).   It's great. Well shot, great actors and a surreal and dark plot. One of David Lynch's best films.   Der siebente Kontinent (1989).   Here's ten great movies that I feel most people really have missed:        * Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)        * Himiko (1974)   * Le rvlateur (1968)             * Mujo (1970)        * Obrazy starho sveta (1972)    * Onna no naka ni iru tanin (1966)    * Shura (1971)           * Tabiate bijan (1974)         * Tobenai chinmoku (1966)        * Tsuit no zawameki (1988)         All of them are really good and deserve more attention. It's for example a bit sad that a great director like Yoshishige Yoshida is so unknown. It's even more heartbreaking that some of the movies I mentioned still haven't got any proper releases, I hope that will change in the future.   Too hard for me to make a top ten, but I know at least I would put these on my list:              * 8 (1963)       * Kokuhakuteki joyron (1971)         * Le mpris (1963)       * Nema-ye Nazdik (1990)     * Nun va Goldoon (1996)               * To vlemma tou Odyssea (1995)         A few of my favourite silents aren't on the list either, like Umirayushchii lebed (1917), Krkarlen (1921), Hxan (1922), Die Nibelungen: Siegfried (1924), Coeur fidle (1923), The Merry Widow (1925), Tretya meshchanskaya (1927), L'argent (1928), Frau im Mond (1929), City Girl (1930), Zemlya (1930), and  propos de Nice (1930). I saw other movies by Victor Sjstrm, Yevgeni Bauer, Erich von Stroheim and Jean Epstein on the list though.   I've seen 69 of them, a lot of shorts that I haven't taken the time to watch. Some interesting choices overall. Some of my favourite silents are present, so that was nice to see. This makes me eager to make a list of my own and also watch some of those that I haven't seen yet.   1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)      2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)      3. L'eclisse (1962)   Il sorpasso (1962) and Saraba natsu no hikari (1968).   Krhozat (1988) by Bla Tarr. Also, do not miss out on Juhy no yoromeki (1968) by Yoshishige Yoshida that someone else already mentioned.         8 (1963).   Aruitemo aruitemo (2008).   Nattvardsgsterna (1963).   Sanma no aji (1962).   Andrei Tarkovsky.   No, how much money a movie makes has nothing to do with how good it is.   It always depends on what you mean with minimalism. But in general terms, nobody did minimalism like Robert Bresson, especially his later films. For example, look at Pickpocket (1959). But first, read about his rules and the way he made his films, it's very interesting and a must if you aren't familiar with his style. He stripped away every bare essential as much as he could, from the acting to the sound. I believe he was the true minimalist.   Tobenai chinmoku (1966) by Kazuo Kuroki.   Double Indemnity (1944) is really his best one in my opinion. One of the best movies when it comes to film noir and even American cinema in general. He's done some other good movies too (and some weaker ones), but I wouldn't call him that obscure as you seem to. Maybe he's not that discussed on a place like this, especially if you compare him to names like Kubrick, Hitchcock and Scorsese, but I feel that there's also some other great filmmakers that get mentioned even less (or possibly not at all). I guess it always depends on what and how you are comparing everything.   This month.   Post Tenebras Lux (2012)?   Tonari no Totoro (1988). It's cute, quick-witted, heartwarming, charming, has a magical atmosphere and looks stunning. It doesn't really rely heavily on conflicts either, which I think makes it even better.   Suna no onna (1964) and Spalovac mrtvol (1969).   I think it could be interesting. There's several other Mexican movies than the ones he was in I rather see getting the Criterion treatment, but on the other hand, I'd welcome some Cantinflas movies more than some other stuff. Also, more Mexican cinema in the collection would probably be a good choice.   Repulsion (1965).   La plante sauvage (1973) is probably the best one I've seen.   I don't have any specific parameters that I look for. But for a biopic to be really great, it has to be special. And in what way, that's something I wouldn't really know until I've seen it. For me, the form and how a biopic is done, that's for example far more important than if it covers a certain period of a subject's life or an entire existence.  My three favourite biopics that I feel are far superior than others:         * Andrey Rublyov (1966)    * Edvard Munch (1974)    * Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)     What makes these three superior is their form and content and how they relate to each other. Tarkovsky's way of working and sculpting in time together with his philosophical and metaphysical depth, the interesting documentary approach Watkins uses, to Yoshida's interwoven and absurdly complex narrative which binds together time and subjects.   Director:          * Michael Haneke         Actors:         * Isabelle Huppert        * Isaach De Bankol        * Kati Outinen       * Taraneh Alidoosti           The Shining (1980) by Stanley Kubrick.   Woody Allen.   You should check out some classic film noir set in Los Angeles:         * Double Indemnity (1944)        * Kiss Me Deadly (1955)         * The Big Heat (1953)       * The Big Sleep (1945)       L.A. Noire took quite many influences from these kind of movies, as you probably know, several titles can be found when looking for the golden film reels. I would also recommend Chinatown (1974) if you want something newer. It is set in 1937, but maybe that's good enough too. That movie is very similar to L.A. Noire.   Andrey Rublyov (1966).   Sanbiki no samurai (1964) by Hideo Gosha and Genroku Chshingura (1941) by Kenji Mizoguchi.   It's really enjoyable and entertaining. One of the best silent movies. If you will be bored? That's a strange question to ask, how should other people know that? On the other hand, it's a must watch if you have the slightest interest in cinema. The movie is a milestone when it comes to science fiction films, especially when it comes to the ones depicting a dystopia. Just the amazing sets makes it worth to see. It's as relevant today as it was back then, maybe even more now.   The Straight Story (1999).   Book chon bang hyang (2011). Hong Sang-soo's movies are really good.   Exactly!   Run times are quite secondary. One of the best films I have seen was over 7 hours long, another one was only 75 minutes, so it's quite irrelevant for me. The run time of a movie has nothing to do with the quality of it, there's so many other factors to the whole picture. Everything depends on how the movie is done, not how long the run time is. Shorter movies can sometimes even feel longer than the longer ones etc. Run times have never been a problem for me though.   I would put Amour (2012) and Ni na bian ji dian (2011) as the top ones in my list. By the way, the 2000s and the 21st century isn't the same thing, just a heads up.      My favourite is Sanma no aji (1962).   Chish Ry.   Conte d'automne (1998). The majority of Rohmer's films have great, realistic, smart and enjoyable dialogue.   Some kind of supernatural entity. Also, the director Mitchell said the following:                *"I'm not personally that interested in where 'it' comes from. To me, it's dream logic in the sense that they're in a nightmare, and when you're in a nightmare there's no solving the nightmare. Even if you try to solve it."*         Three good movies about filmmakers:        * 8 (1963)     * Stardust Memories (1980)        * To vlemma tou Odyssea (1995)          Three good movies about painters:       * Andrey Rublyov (1966)        * Edvard Munch (1974)       * La belle noiseuse (1991)        Gamlet (1964).   It does!   Trois couleurs: Bleu (1993) by Krzysztof Kieslowski. About a woman (played by Juliette Binoche) struggling to find a way to live her life after the death of her husband and daughter.            Michael Haneke.   Le trou (1960).   That's the way life can be.         It's a bit hard to rank, but I would at least put these five in the top:         * A torini l (2011)        * Amour (2012)        * Book chon bang hyang (2011)       * Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013)        * The Act of Killing (2012)         Is it for a specific reason that your list only contains movies in the English language? Do you have another list for the rest? Or why did you put emphasis on that part? I don't get it.            No. He doesn't even come close to masters like Mizoguchi, Bresson, Tarkovsky, Bergman etc.   No. The best movie I've seen is of course my favourite, Der siebente Kontinent (1989).   To take an example, 2004 isn't old. And I'm pretty sure the majority with the least interest in movies who hangs out here has seen or knows most of those in the list. Many of them are the most celebrated ones here on Reddit.   Not at all.   No, but by directors that actually can make something good.         Woody Allen.      What do you mean with playing it safe? I don't think the majority of critics are writing what the public wants to hear, I think most of them are honest. But then again, I'm no expert in how the majority of critics do their work. By the way, I rather feel that movie critics overall nowadays are even too generous, but that's me.          Anyways, let's talk about the movie. I thought it was quite bad. I wrote something about it in a similar thread, so what I'm going to say is about the same I said before, but it's always interesting to talk about movies and share your own opinions. For a narrative film of this kind and for it to be an allegory of interest, the story was too simple sided and superficial. In the end, I couldn't care less about anything. The whole movie felt something like a promotional commercial for Die Antwoord, which was silly. And quite everything actually felt silly, stupid, hollow and over the top in a bad way. From the pathetic dialogue to the action and to how it was shot. It's hard to take it seriously, because it doesn't work as a comedy or any kind of critique of something either. It makes me wonder if Blomkamp offered someone from junior high to write him the dialogue.        Manhattan (1979).   Here's 20 of my favourites that are 90 minutes or under:       * Csillagosok, katonk (1967) (90 minutes)        * Gion bayashi (1953) (85 minutes)       * Hiroshima mon amour (1959) (90 minutes)       * I fidanzati (1963) (77 minutes)         * Koridorius (1995) (85 minutes)               * La jete (1962) (28 minutes)         * Le rvlateur (1968) (67 minutes)        * Les yeux sans visage (1960) (88 minutes)       * Mouchette (1967) (78 minutes)          * Nattvardsgsterna (1963) (81 minutes)      * Nun va Goldoon (1996) (78 minutes)       * Obrazy starho sveta (1972) (70 minutes)           * Okasareta hakui (1967) (56 minutes)        * Persona (1966) (85 minutes)        * Pickpocket (1959) (75 minutes)         * Procs de Jeanne d'Arc (1962) (65 minutes)       * Sayat Nova (1969) (79 minutes)          * Shinjuku maddo (1970) (65 minutes)           * Un homme qui dort (1974) (77 minutes)        * Une femme est une femme (1965) (85 minutes)         If Studio Ghibli are going to continue, maybe they could do a good job with it. Or if they could team up with Apichatpong Weerasethakul as a director in some way.   I think I like Sang sattawat (2006) and Sud sanaeha (2002) the best, especially when they're at their most minimalistic state. He's indeed one of the most interesting directors working today. Really looking forward to his newest movie.   Jean-Pierre Laud did an amazing job in Les quatre cents coups (1959).     	121

    I was told that I participated in vote brigading. Still not exactly sure what that means. They said I could be unbanned if I agreed not to do it anymore. I told them that I would not do it again but so far no reversal. Still whether I was wrong or not isn't the real problem, its that they just shadow banned me without any warning. If they had banned me from the sub or deleted my account I would have at least known I did something wrong and changed the way I behaved.  Small solace I can take is that this account now has way more karma then my old one ever did.  	2
 Hm, that's really interesting. The upper body strength makes sense, but I wouldn't expect the jalapeo thing.     It's all good! It's related to my question and it is still very interesting!   That actually really fascinating. Especially from a psychological standpoint. As a woman I think (especially about emotional things), we do the same thing in assuming the other woman knows the feeling we are talking about. Thank you for sharing that!    I assumed it wouldn't be the exact same, but I've always been very curious about transgendered people and this shed a lot of light. You don't meet many here in the Deep South, if you remember the subs let me know!  	4
 I really wish Aang and Katara could somehow reunite in the spirit wold.  It's to bad Aang didn't make the same journey into the spirit world as Iroh.  Plot twist maybe he did.  That would be so awesome.   I honestly found my self routing for Zuko to turn good way more than i was routing for team avatar in book 2 ATLA.  The evolution of and depth of those two characters is what makes them so great.   Well I did not say that it is affordable. I just said that you don't need to to go for all the bells and whistles.  Going to an instate school full time can cost close to 20k a year.  It is really not possible to work your way through school with that kind of price tag.    You do the math and you figure out the only way you can pay for that is if you have a full time job that pays much more than minimum wage.  I don't know how anyone could hold a full time job while also going to school full time.    If you think part time is the answer than get ready to be going to school for the next 12 years of your life.  I really doubt that is practical.  Once you figure all that up you realize why so many kids are taking out loans to pay for college.  It is a smart calculation based on opportunity cost.   Cool   What kind of plane is that? and where is the tail number it it that tiny thing on the rudder?      Yea you do have a point.  What do you get for your 300 dollar meal plan, that is pretty cheap.   Welcome to the hobby they call these things drones to make them sound scary.  I like this video that shows how hard it is to actually see anything from a drones camera.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnVjrIz0xrc    Thats good.  I like how the news article makes it clear that it was a toy and how tiny it actually was.  I thought it was a very reasonable article   I know The next part is really cool, it talks about how they recovered Mir using the Soyuz.  Edit: Somebody posted a link below  but it is not available in my country :(   http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p02863gw/horizon-19971998-mir-mortals   It's not that hard, Live off campus, don't get a meal plan, and I am pretty sure you can opt out of the Rec centers at some colleges as well.   Well considering they still have telemetry there is still a decent chance.     Dang now i feel like an idiot.  I really did't know who Al Sharpton was, I have just heard his name before.  I guess my point stands but obviously not Al Sharpton.    Your joke completely went over my head and i am a complete idiot.   ~~That is good and I think that can help the movement, but i don't think he is it's representative or leader, at least not yet.  Its not like news stations call up Sharpton to ask what his plans are for the future of the movement.~~  Think about it if somebody wanted to talk to the head of the movement, who would they talk to.  In my opinion there is not currently a true head of this movement.  The biggest thing that could make a difference to this movement is if they got a leader like MLK was to the civil rights movement in the 60's.  They need a guy that can e the face of their cause and give it a voice and a direction.  So when people think of the movement, they automatically think of that guy.  Edit: I am an idiot who did not know who Al Sharpton is.   Yea that does seem plausible, but from what i have read the guys neck was really badly injured not some fracture   [His family say he lapsed into a coma after his spine was 80% severed at his neck and his voice box was injured.](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/20/baltimore-officers-suspended-death-freddie-gray)  I think what people are tired of is you do not see white people getting shot in the back while they run away, or white people having their necks become mysteriously broken while in police custody.   I also agree I feel like riots happen when frustration reaches a breaking point.  People are can only put up with so much before they say enough is enough.  This is especially true when they feel like conventional means for getting things done are just giving them the run around.  People get tired of the BS.    Whats too bad is the current movement lacks any real leadership.  This lack of leadership means there is nobody to give the cause a single voice.  This makes the movement disorganized easy to criticize (because there is no representative to defend the movement) and prone to violence and when violence does break out, it comes across as pointless and just people that are looking for an excuse to destroy stuff and steal things, not people mad over social injustice.    Edit: Grammar   Exactly that is not how are justice system operates.  Police can not act as the Judge Jury and Executioner.   See when I saw that I was under the impression that is was the same Raava being reborn from within Vaatu.   There is a difference between being innocent until proven guilty and being above the law.  Innocent until proven guilty means they can't put you in prison until they have proven you guilty of a crime in court.  Investigating and charging someone with a crime does not make them guilty.  The media seems to have a hard time understanding this, that just because you have been arrested does not make you guilty.  I am saying that it is ridiculous that this kind of thing gets swept under the rug and no investigation is launched and no charges are made when it is obvious that there was wrong doing.  A guy getting a broken neck while sitting in jail does not just happen.  If this happened anywhere else it would be considered a murder and investigated as such.  Why does the same not hold true in a jail cell.  Expecting an investigation and calling this a murder is not in contradiction to innocent until proven guilty.   Yea that is what is so ridiculous about this, obviously the guys neck was not broken when he got to jail, and necks don't jut break themselves.  There is definitely fowl play here, but the police are still sticking to the line that they don't know what happened.  Thats total BS they know exactly what happened.   Maybe, but i still feel sad that Aang and Wan basically got deleted.   Nothing is impossible in fiction, it is quite possible they could come up with some story for how Korra reconnects with the past Avatars.  I choose to believe it is possible to reconnect to the past avatars.  Korra has just not figured it out yet.   We don't know Aang's fathering was that bad.  There was some resentment, but that does not mean he was a bad father.  It's obvious they all loved him.   That still does not make breaking his neck acceptable.  We can't just forgive this police brutality because it was done to a guy that has a history of crime.  Innocent until proven guilty.   That is actually how the one is mounted in the picture lol   MEXICO IS THE BEST!!!!!   This is a great summary thankyou   God that is ugly it looks like a big bumper sticker.   How can I check to make sure the esc i am getting has this feature?   Is this what you mean by a low voltage alarm?   http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__18987__On_Board_Lipoly_Low_Voltage_Alarm_2s_4s_.html   So I am getting into the hobby, I purchased a used quad a few months ago and enjoy flying it, but now i want to do some airplanes as well.  With my quad the KK2 board has an alarm and voltage meter hooked in so when the voltage gets low the alarm starts to ring and i know to land.  My question is how do you keep from under volting your LIPO on an airplane, that does not have a control board?    I am looking into getting some of these Lemon Rx Receivers http://www.lemon-rx.com/shop/index.php?route=product/product path=59 product_id=92   I was going to say it looks too short and too wide. lol   I have not, I have sailed Lasers, Sunfish, 420s, and FJs.  Slightly larger boats I have sailed have been Flying Scotts and Thistles.  Out of those  I would say Sunfish is my favorite but I am also biased.  If you have sailed 420's or FJ's I would say both the Sunfish and the Laser feel like a faster more agile boat than either of those.  The 420 is like driving a truck, where the Laser and Sunfish are more like go-karts.  I saw somebody suggest going and borrowing or renting them and seeing what they are like.  I think that is a good suggestion.  Again though, make sure they are in good condition otherwise it wont give you he right impression of the boat.  As for the downsides of the two boats, the Laser is tipsy because of its round hull and when sailing especially in heavy wind, you never really get a break.  The Laser is also not that great for carrying more than one person, because the coordination gets hard with the boat being tipsy.  I would say the Sunfish is good on both of these points.    The Sunfish on the other hand is slightly slower than the laser, and due to the lateen rig can not point quite as high.  Both of these are really only noticeable when you are sailing next to a Laser or maybe if you have gotten used to the characteristics of sailing a laser.  Thats really all I can think to tell you.  You probably all ready know this but when buying a sunfish or a Laser, you should not bother with a boat that has any leaks.  I know in the sunfish the foam on the inside and the fiberglass absorbs the water and really weigh the boat down, even after you have drained it.  The hull on a new sunfish weighs 120 pounds so if you go look and a Sunfish and it weighs a ton than it is not worth buying, a Sunfish should be easy to pick up with two people.  Thats really all I can think of, is the Laser Pico similar to the 420 or the FJ?  What other boats have you sailed maybe I can help give you a compassion.   ohh i misread the comment oops.   yea I saw that after it makes sense.  An interface with dragon would be easier.   I found my first randevu/docking so much more satisfying than landing on the Mun.  I actually couldn't use docking ports on my first docking because it was a rescue mission to a spacecraft that didn't have docking ports.  I made this awesome clamp out of landing legs as this was .20 and successfully saved my Kerbals. =D   Dude you haven't seen it?  It is awesome!!!!!   *"gooseneck" not a yoke  I rig mine by myself all the time.  I think the trick is raising  the gooseneck first, then pulling the halyard, it takes all the tension off the halyard and makes the whole process a lot easier.   An important thing with getting a sunfish, is making sure you get a good one. You can buy a sunfish for 800 bucks, but it is going to leak be heavy, and sail slow.  I love Sunfish, but i have sailed ones like this and they suck.  Even with good wind they just sit there.  On the other hand a Sunfish in good condition sails great.  They are fast, and even plain on reach in good wind.  Make sure if you get a Sunfish it is in good condition, and i would suggest looking for one with a racing rig as they have some features that make them go faster.    The main thing is don't get those cheap Sunfish.  They will be a big disappointment, and i would hate to see you get a bad impression of the boat because you got one of those crappy water logged ones.   The apples to apples comparison is with the sail attached to the spars.  No sunfish sailor ever takes the sail off the spars you put the spars and the mast together and roll the sail, and then the whole thing goes into the bag.  That is how everyone does it.  Sunfish sailors are taking perfectly good care of their sails.  Your example of wrapping the sail around the mast would be comparable to leaving rig and sail on the boat and just putting the sail beneath the boat cover.  With lasers it makes more sense to take the sail off the mast because it just slips off the top.   If you have never sailed a Sunfish before, the sail is attached to the spars with either plastic clips, or small ties.  Anybody i have ever met just puts the spars together and rolled up the sail.  It would be pretty silly to take the sail off the spar every time you de-rigged.  It would take at least an hour, and then you would have to reattach it again the next time which would take another hour.  Because you would have to go through and undo every one of those ties/clips.  There really is no downside to leaving the sail attached either, if you roll the sail right, it should not be detrimental to the sail.  you do not wrap the sail around the spars, you roll it up next to the spars, so there is really no wrinkles or pressure points on the sail.   I agree I like the Sunfish for its simplicity and it's ruggedness.  I have sailed both the Laser and the Sunfish, but I still love the Sunfish.   What in your opinion makes a Sunfish more complicated?  I own a sunfish with a racing rig, and it doesn't see hard at all.   I would think the Sunfish are just as easy to rig.  Step the mast, and pull on the halyard.   It seems like there are a lot of people that like lasers on here.  I am a fan of Sunfish, I have sailed both, and it is true that lasers are fast.  What I like about sunfish though is they are not so much work to sail.  The more square hull makes them much more stable than a laser and not so much of a work out.  Also in my opinion the Sunfish is a tougher boat than the Laser.  The Laser is all about speed, and because of that the hull is thinner, and also rounded.  I have had collisions while racing Sunfish that probably would have punched a hole in a Laser,  I can't even find a ding on the gelcoat on my sunfish afterwords.  As to speed, the sunfish is not slow in my opinion, but it is slower than a Laser.    To sum things up if you like speed and are looking for a sports car the Laser is probably better.  If you are looking for a more laid back fun boat that is easier to rig, more about sailing, and less about fine tuning everything, the Sunfish might be better.  That laid back atmosphere continues to the people who sail them.  Some of the nicest sailers i have met have been other sunfish sailers.   Sunfish are a bit easier to rig in my opinion mostly because there are less lines and they are less complex.   can someone explain what LV-N is and it needing oxidizer, and not needing it now?   yea i agree, I almost wish there were more cool terrain artifacts like this.   Mech Jeb is also excellent for giving you data on your rocket like delta-V and TWR honestly I barely ever use it for autopilot, i mostly just use it to figure out more data on my rocket.   Yea you do, they are hydrofoils and create a lot of their downforce by moving through the water.  Also, speculating here, but i would bet that the ASDS doesn't have as much deck roll as people think.  It is a very big ship, and unlike many shipping boats, that are small and need these weights stabilize the boat,  the sheer size and mass of the ASDS is quite stabilizing on its own.   would it be very hard to add an interface to allow the solar panels to charge the second stage?  It seems like it would just be adding some wires and connecting them to the batteries in the second stage.  You would also need to add point where the ires could disconnect when the dragon needs to disconnect from the second stage.   that could be easily fixed with some solar panels.   Wow that was a great answer   The problem is OSHA can afford to sue companies many employees can not.   I think they had problems with certain components freezing, like the fuel lines.  And they would probably need to add some solar panels to the side like the V2 trunk to keep it powered.   I have seen in other places in these comments that SpaceX may try to fix this and use the upgraded upper stage to show that they are capable of relights after long amounts of time.   I am pretty sure google lunar X prize is contracted for a different Falcon Heavy mission.   If the pilot is incapacitated, if the pilot goes crazy, if someone decides to try and break their way in...   its not hard to think of reasons why its a god idea to have two people there.   You mean no school bus? :(    Lol I think i would be just as excited for a mars mission as a school bus in space.   Lol i can't spell   Yea but as we can see, there are other reasons to always have two people in the cockpit.   Are you referring to MH370 and German Wings as the two crashes caused by pilots?  There is no proof right now that MH370 was caused by the pilots.  Second I think especially in the case of German Wings, the problem was procedure.  In the US there are always 2 people in the cockpit.  This is for safety reasons when opening the door.  The pilot is supposed to check to see that is the pilot asking to be let in, but if he is the only one in the cockpit how can he without leaving nobody at the controls. You can never fully screen out crazy people from the system, that is why smart procedures are important.  In many crashes it is very simple to just blame the pilots even when there is evidence that it was not the pilots fault. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_811#Personal_investigation,  Video explaining the latch issue and how Boeing blamed ground handlers: https://youtu.be/7n8JIbMF0og?t=31m58s   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_rudder_issues This is a list of incidents caused by faulty valves for the rudder causing the rudder to go hard over.  Many of these crashes were originally blamed on the pilots, including a few that were blamed on pilot suicide.  I am not saying German Wings was caused by the pilots, but often times it is much easier and there is a financial incentive for the investigation to find the pilots at fault.   Ok I was not aware of that.   Maintenance does not have to erase the recorder, there is a button in the cockpit that you push.  If you push and hold the button for two seconds, provided the plane is on the ground and the parking break is engaged, it will erase the flight voice recorder, but not the data recorder.    I could be a little out of date now, but from what i understand this feature was hard fought by unions when voice recorders were being introduced.  The unions wanted to make sure the voice recorders would only be used in crash investigation, and not be used by management to police pilot performance.  So if you are parked at the gate after the flight you can erase the voice recorder.  You wanted a source, This is where I remember first reading about the ability to erase the voice recorder after a flight, but I have heard it from other airline pilots as well. At one station, two women are assembling control panels for cockpit voice recorders. Theres the erase button, says John Kerwin, vice president of operations. Ive never met a pilot yet who believes it works, but it does. And that illuminates one major problem with the idea of streaming data from aircraft in flight, at least as it pertains to cockpit audio: the near certainty that pilots will never stand for it. By law, cockpit voice recordings may be accessed only by investigators after an accident. When a flight arrives safely at the gate, the pilot hits the erase button. (It wont work in flight or during taxiing.) In the event of an accident, transcripts may be released as part of a report but not, as a rule, the actual recording. This is partly a matter of professional pride, partly to spare the feelings of pilots families if they are killed. But primarily it seems to be a labor-management issue. The Air Line Pilots Association, the aviators union, mobilized last year to fight a bill that would allow airlines to use voice and data recorders to evaluate the performance of cockpit crews  http://www.wired.com/2011/06/ff_blackboxes/   I believe that for some carriers it is standard to erase the voice recorder at the end of the flight once you are parked at the gate.   But the voice recorder is erased at the end of each flight.   I saw a post over at /r/MH370 talking about how they were disappointed that even if the plane was found and black boxes recovered, it was likely that the voice recorder would not say much because it will have most likely looped over.  My question is why is the loop on the voice recorder so short?  Wouldn't it make sense to have the loop be 10 or maybe even 20 hours so that it is impossible for it too over write during a normal flight?    It just seems like this has happened a few times where the voice recorder has over written and it makes it a lot harder to understand what happened.    It also seems like storage space should not be an issue, new micro SD cards are as large as 120 GB so even with special designing to make the hard drive crash resistant, it seems like it should not be that hard to get a hard drive that has enough space for a few hours of audio recording.       I would guess that it can.  Often times it is human nature to underestimate objects like foam that seem harmless, because we are not used to dealing with them at their extremes.  Like when an [object is moving very fast](https://youtu.be/2eTRaJGDe-8?t=1m30s), or when there are [large amounts of something.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Molasses_Disaster)  My guess is if the hangar collapsed it could create damage to the airplanes.  Just because of the weight of it all.  the question is how extreeme the damage would be.   I remember reading in "Fate is the Hunter" about how you can drop your flaps real quick in an emergency if you need to gain some altitude real quick.  This would be a perfect example of where it could have worked.  But realistically he probably should have had some flaps before he even started the takeoff.    Actually in many cases Thunder cells extend well above the capabilities of an Airliner,  and even if they don't technically go above the airliners capabilities sometimes you need to be flying lower.  For instance if the Plane is getting ready to start their decent into an airport, you can not be flying as high as the airplane can go, you need to be lower and getting ready to descend.   I know that is what I am saying we knew almost exactly where Air France 447 went down, and it took 2 years to find it.  MH370 is more than likely going to take much much longer.   oops lol   That might have been true a week or a month after the crash.  But considering it has been a year, the probability has pretty much reached zero.  There is always a .0000001% chance but eventually .000000... just becomes zero.   I was waiting for the Castaway reference.   Well now we pretty much know exactly what happened to Air France 447 because we have recovered the plane and its black boxes.    Before we actually found the plane we had a basic idea.  We knew that the weather had been kind of stormy and that in the events leading up to the crash the plane had sent automated messages saying there were certain problems onboard like the pitot tubes(the sensors that say your airspeed) were not functioning properly.  So the best guess was somehow the stormy weather had brought down the plane.  We also found debris on the ocean confirming that it had crashed.      After finding the plane and recovering the black boxes a much more complete picture was created revealing that the storm had caused the pitot tubes to freeze over causing erroneous airspeed readings and causing the plane to send the automated messages.  that was just the seed of the crash.  The events that actually caused the crash stemmed off of that and were much more complicated.  Most of the reasons for the crash were the pilots being confused about what the planes instruments were actually telling them and what the plane was actually doing (the plane never said airspeed reading bad it just gave them erroneous readings) bad design of the cockpit(the joysticks for the two pilots in an airbus plane can move in two different directions at the same time unlike almost every other aircraft made.  During the crash one pilot was holding back the his joystick which was overriding the imputes from the other pilot the pilots did not realize this was happening for a long time, and only added to their confusion.) and many more factors  read the wikipedia article.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_447  Edit: Pitot not peto   Thats what I am saying. Even when we found debris and knew pretty much exactly where it went down, it still took 2 years to find Air France 447.   Did you find the Panama to Colombia Car ferry xpress?   http://www.ferryxpress.com/  As soon as I watched this I was like ohh shoot this would help him out there.  Also how long till you are in Quito?   It could take a very long time to find MH370 if we find it at all.  It took 2 years to find [Air France 447](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_447) and we knew almost exactly where it went down.   No just a search and recovery, everyone is definitely dead.   The plane of the rotor can be angled so that it is at an angle to the oncoming air.  In this case if you angle the blades all the way back the air coming off the prop hits the rotors spooling them up, even while you are stationary.  Notice when she is taxing the rotor is parallel to the ground and the rotor is not spinning. But when the rotor starts spinning it is now at an angle.   They work off of the same principal as an autorotating helicopter.  The little engine in the back gives it forward speed so air keeps moving over the rotor.   Well Propulsive landing has been shown to be a viable option.    I would probably go with that, my runner up would be a lifting body shaped second stage with an heat shield plug for the top of the second stage  for landing you could go with something as simple as skis, or perhaps small landing gear.  the lifting body could even be efficient if you put the rp1 in the edges that can't keep pressure as well, and put the LOX in the center tank.   I agree   What happens if you try to reenter with a completely ablated heat shield?   http://i.imgur.com/1FqRbm3.png   Take a deep breath, and ask her if she want's to go do something together.   I think vertical separation is an issue.     Can you link to it here?   You guys are so cool.  You should post more updates and pictures here like this. Maybe some pictures out the window and so on.  Good luck on the Pacific.   Why do they do that?  it seems like putting the whole second stage in a fairing adds a lot of weight.   Yea I agree I am getting pretty sick of privatization.  In theory it can work but in reality it usually just means that people at the top make a bunch of money and ruin what ever was privatized.    Imagine privatizing education.  We have seen how well that has worked with for profit colleges.      Just wanted to say I don't agree or disagree with the article, I just thought it was interesting.         You guys are nuts.  At dominos all 10s and 20s go in the safe immediately.  I doubt our registers have more than 100 dollars in them ant any one time.   No lol.  But I have been there when somebody makes a joke and it does not make sense so I figured I would cut out the middle man and help out the new redditors that don't get it.      For some reason when I read that it sounds like a valley girl saying it in my head.   lol I know that feeling.  http://i.imgur.com/DRDrtmL.png   ["It's got the stuff the country craves"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Vw2CrY9Igs)   I never thought about bird strikes and tree strikes, that makes sense.      You have a good point.

Boat propellers have a nylon ring on the inside so that when your prop hits something the nylon breaks, breaking the connection between the prop and the motor preventing it from ruining your engine.  All you have to do then is go buy a new prop.    Edit: Didn't think about all the things that might hit your propeller besides a runway. lol   Besides the tons of errors about flying(No you don't lay the hammer down going through a storm, quite the opposite), it perpetuates the fictitious belief that pilots are a bunch of unprofessional hotshots.  The kind of behavior that Denzel showed in the movie (sleeping while flying, drunk, doing drugs) would not make it anywhere in the airlines.  That kind of stuff is taken seriously if the other pilot can smell alcohol on you or suspects that you are drunk they can and are expected to report it immediately.    Pilots are professionals and you don't get to that level in aviation without being skilled, professional and a little luck.  It is extremely hard and only the best make it.

You are right about the reentry burn pushing off the shockwave, but i disagree about the velocities.  The first stage is nowhere close to orbital velocity, LEO is close to 8 km/s  at MECO 1 the craft is only doing around 1.8-1.9 km/s so no where close to the velocities of LEO and what a reentering spaceship would be.   Yea what gets me is there have not been any changes.  The same exact thing could still happen.  How hard would it be to add some feedback motors to the joystick so that both move the same way.   http://www.asias.faa.gov/pls/apex/f?p=100:95:0::NO::P95_EVENT_LCL_DATE,P95_LOC_CITY_NAME,P95_REGIST_NBR:11-APR-15,FORT%20PIERCE,N7502S  http://www.trade-a-plane.com/detail/aircraft/Multi+Engine+Piston/1970/Aerostar/601/2076612.html   This is such a stupid design by airbus.  This could not happen on practically any other airplane because when you move one control column the other one moves with it. So there can never be any confusion about what the inputs are.  Besides the freezing of the peto tubes I think this dangerous design was what propagated the confusion and caused the crash of Air France.    They blame the pilots for not understanding the situation, but imagine how confusing it is for everything to be going haywire, and on top of that the inputs you think you are giving the plane are not actually what the plane is receiving.  It pisses me off that they just swept that under the rug.   The co-pilot and the pilot are both completely capable of flying the airplane.  One of them is always the pilot flying.   400 feet is actually not that much for an airliner, and I can completely understand him being confused.  An oncoming plane would look like a bright star until only seconds before a collision.   Yea I have not gotten to complex airplanes yet, but I feel bad for this guy.  Quick thinking by the guy, but I would be very worried about the damage done to the airplane doing a go around like that, very lucky in my opinion.   I listened to it without sound the first time.  With sound it is way worse.   A guy landed with his gear up and realized it just as his belly touched the runway, so he added power and went around.  Obviously that makes it sound a lot simpler than what he did in the video.   They might be but I doubt it.  You also have to remember that the heating that the booster is experiencing is quite low, it does not even need a heat shield compared to the heats that the engines experience during a burn, the heat from reentry is much less significant.    The reason the heat is so much lower is because the rocket is moving much more slowly than a vehicle entering from orbit.  Most of the stresses the booster experiences on its way to a landing are actually aerodynamic stresses not thermal.   Creo que este video necesita el NFSW   Exactly many people think that if we spend enough money, we can make this countries borders impermeable, and make ourselves completely save from terrorism/violence but no matter how much we spend you can never do it.   It is not that hard to do it correctly.  A perfect example is the Saturn 5 compared to an atlas rocket, or even more extreme the Saturn 5 compared to a rocket the size of the Falcon 1.  The Falcon 1 would be way more inefficient launching the same amount of mass than one large Saturn 5.  And yes the things you mentioned above do make it harder but certainly not anywhere close to impossible the Saturn 5 is an example of that.    When I say do it correctly I am referring to to rockets like the Soviet moon rocket that was poorly designed and because of this lost the advantages from it being larger.   See I never did those calculations partly because i did not know how.  So what ended up happening is a lot of times I would design a completely over powered ship.  But I can see what you are saying.   I think part of the reason he was able to make the trip without getting killed was because of the gyrocopter he was flying.  Wether he planned it that way, or it was just luck, by using the gyrocopter(which is very small), and flying it very low and slow he was able to avoid a lot of the safety features that are used in that area.    If he had been in a normal small plane, he would have been picked up on radar, and he would have been intercepted, it has happened many times mostly from people accidentally entering restricted airspace by accident.  Jets would have come and intercepted him warned him to change course and follow instructions, and if he had continued they would have shot him down.  Air traffic control even said that they saw him, but because his gyrocopter was so small and moving so slow they thought it was a flock of geese.  So this brings up the final point while we could probably spend billions more dollars and get a radar system in the DC area that can pick up insects.  The question is why do we need to?  A gyrocopter this small is barely capable of carrying any weight, and even if he had had malicious intent and flown it into the capital it probably would have done barely any damage to the building.  You can see [this crash of a much larger small plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Tampa_airplane_crash) barely did any damage to the building.    So yea it does not look great that this guy  managed to fly his gyrocopter to the capital but considering that the risk he posed to the public was minimal I don't think that we should be going and spending even more money trying to lock down the DC are even more than it already is.   You also have to remember that a lot of times especially lately in the house, they schedule votes on stuff that has no way of going anywhere just so they can say they voted on it.  It got ridiculous with Obama care.  A couple times a month the house would vote to repeal Obama care just so they could say in the next election that they had voted to repeal Obama care.  A lot of the knowing how your congressman has voted has just created a lot of political theater.   Because of vaccinations :|   The thing that makes me question this, is vaccines bruise you for a few days.  Its hard to imagine the mom would not notice.  If the kid is a baby than the mom would probably see the bruises and if the kid is a todler or something its hard to image the kid would not mention it, like "my arm hurts" or something like that.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nhgfjrKi0o   I understand what you are talking about, but that is only if you use the auto pilot.  Mechjeb is not just about auto pilot though.  Mechjeb gives you a ton of data like DeltaV, thrust to weight ratio, exactly how many seconds more of fuel you have, and a lot more, and you can break the data down by stage so when you are building your rocket you can see if your stages have the appropriate thrust  and such.  Thats the kind of stuff I use Mech Jeb for anyway, I think I have only done an auto launch once or twice because I wanted to see if Mechjeb would actually do it.   This is sort of true, there are definitely engineering problems with scaling up, but when you do it correctly, scaling up can actually lead to a much more efficient rocket, because a larger percentage of the mass of the rocket is fuel compared to smaller rockets.   Actually a lot of these things were in the works leading up to the Colombia disaster.  They were developing liquid fueled boosters, and they were also developing more powerful versions of the solid rocket boosters.  After Colombia though NASA questioned what the purpose of the shuttle was and decided to stop developing new technology for the shuttle, and use that money to begin developing a new rocket.  In fact they might have decided to bring the shuttle to an end earlier, but they needed it to finish building the ISS.

Actually I am pretty sure that the Falcon 9 restarts its center Merlin engine 4 times.  Once for launch, once for retrograde burn to limit its downrange distance and eventually in the future bring it back to shore.  Once for reentry burn to limit its speed so it does not break up when it enters the thicker lower atmosphere, and finally the suicide burn that brings it in for landing.  	138
 This story starts off a few months into the college year. I am 19 and still getting acclimated to this new town  and lifestyle.   I live in the dorms, which are apartment style dorms and since it is a very small university,  there are maybe 150 kids total in student housing.  (backstory to this building: 3 young female students died in 2011 after a fire trapped them in the upstairs apartment and they suffocated. cause of fire is unknown.) During my first few months of living there with my roommates, the hot water would randomly turn on, doors in the house have locked, and a shadow figure was standing behind my computer chair while i was in it. we brushed it all off until the day this happened. now i am a believer that it wasnt councidence that all these things happened to us.  I meet a girl,  we will call her E. We were great friends for a while until there was an argument which led us to a 3 month span of ignoring and hate. Anyways,  we started talking again after those 3 months and she would call me whenever she needs something, wants to go on a walk, or needs to vent. One night E calls me and asks me to come over to help. Her voice sounds very.. trembling and scared. I rush over to her apartment, which is on the backside of the building opposite of mine. There is a sidewalk inbetween the building and a small forest of trees. I text her and tell her im at the door. She opens it and looks terrified. She told me that she had seen a black silhouette across the sidewalk standing in front of the trees "staring at her" from a distance. I tell her to calm down, we are in a very nice neighborhood and assured her there was nobody there. After an hour of two of trying to calm her down i finally have her convinced that shes safe. As i get up to give her a hug so she can go back to sleep, i feel a weird feeling.. that ive never felt. like something was there, watching, close. I get suspicious of this feeling and cant shake the sensation that someone is there.  We hear a noise. I look up and ive seen something i have never seen, nor can i explain. On the ground in front of the trees, roughly 5 yards away, is a faint white mist, moving gracefully. As it moves lateral us, i start to notice it isnt just a small mist, it was a full bodied, white apparition, of sorts. i cannot explain what ive seen very well, nor have i written any stories on here before, so i hope you understand the picture im trying to paint. It was roughly my height, within 2 inches of 5 foot 10. It appeared to be taking steps, and have the shape of a human..almost. All of this happened for what seemed like an eternity, my mouth was frozen from speech for the first few seconds i saw it, eyes fixed on it. but E did not notice it, as she was facing with her back towards it. I say out of curiosity and my own skepticism of paranormal "What The F***?" She asks me "What did you see? whay did you see?!" Frantically trying to get an answer. I look at her and say "I have no idea.. it was a..white.. mist" i have no idea what i saw to this day.  At this point she is freaking out and scrambles inside. i run home to my apartment and my roommates look at me as i burst in the room and ask "what the hell is wrong with you?" i told them this story and they have no idea either.   i apologize for bad storytelling, as this is my first post. i hope you get the picture im trying to paint with the genuine fear and curiosity i had toward this mist. it was unlike anything ive ever seen.   Any ideas on what i saw? i would like to know so maybe i can contact it if i see it again..  	1

The psychedelic state induced by ayahuasca modulates the activity and connectivity of the default mode network. PLoS ONE PLoS One 2015 18;10(2):e0118143. Epub 2015 Feb 18. Fernanda Palhano-Fontes, Katia C Andrade, Luis F Tofoli, Antonio C Santos, Jose Alexandre S Crippa, Jaime E C Hallak, Sidarta Ribeiro, Draulio B de Araujo  The experiences induced by psychedelics share a wide variety of subjective features, related to the complex changes in perception and cognition induced by this class of drugs. A remarkable increase in introspection is at the core of these altered states of consciousness. Self-oriented mental activity has been consistently linked to the Default Mode Network (DMN), a set of brain regions more active during rest than during the execution of a goal-directed task. Here we used fMRI technique to inspect the DMN during the psychedelic state induced by Ayahuasca in ten experienced subjects. Ayahuasca is a potion traditionally used by Amazonian Amerindians composed by a mixture of compounds that increase monoaminergic transmission. In particular, we examined whether Ayahuasca changes the activity and connectivity of the DMN and the connection between the DMN and the task-positive network (TPN). Ayahuasca caused a significant decrease in activity through most parts of the DMN, including its most consistent hubs: the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC)/Precuneus and the medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC). Functional connectivity within the PCC/Precuneus decreased after Ayahuasca intake. No significant change was observed in the DMN-TPN orthogonality. Altogether, our results support the notion that the altered state of consciousness induced by Ayahuasca, like those induced by psilocybin (another serotonergic psychedelic), meditation and sleep, is linked to the modulation of the activity and the connectivity of the DMN.

Hi, I don't batch edit, I do one pic at a time. I will eventually post more from this place   Set of three fun themed shots here  http://imgur.com/a/2bole            lolol   No - I post a picture a day, from a variety of locations.  They might be from the same place a few days in a row, or they may not.  My only error here is adding links in my descriptors.   seems 128 upvoters don't seem to mind that I happen to have a link in my post on imgur.  regardless, I won't add that link in future posts.   me to, lots of emotions and thoughts when exploring!   I'm not in it for the stuff, I have seen some incredibly valuable stuff in these places and it has taken some serious will power to not take some of it!   you reddit people sure are miserable crusty mother fuckers   Lady died earlier this year. Looked like the family took what they wanted and left the rest behind and the house is in an area of future development so will likely be demo'd   stay tuned :)   haha, we set up the shot with shit we found around the house            it sure can   this was in january this year   thanks!   wow thank you!                  https://www.flickr.com/photos/rockandrollfreak/sets/72157643791700635/   wrong   Thank You                     what does that even mean??  sorry I don't speak reddit                  look for a building go to the top push door  - if locked, leave and find another one  - if not locked - go outside!!!  Rule - don't fall!!   Me...if it's locked, I go and find another building   Some are locked, some are not - it's hit and miss   It's hit and miss, many buildings have locked roof access, some don't however, most hate two or more stairwells so if the first one doesn't provide access - try the next one.   good eye!   Do you say that every time you see someone take a photo of a bird, or flowers or nature? Do you say that when people take photos of children?  Give me a break,, its a genre just like those i mention above   lolol good one!!!   there it is!!!!   for the love of Pete!                     I wanna say you're wrong...  but you're not - you are right!!!   Thank You!               You's a smart one Crazy Monkey!!!!!!   You really are the smartest!!!   negatory                     My fav shot of the year  https://www.flickr.com/photos/rockandrollfreak/15574342528/in/photostream/lightbox/   I would have to say this one, because it's outside of my usual genre or decay/urban exploring  https://www.flickr.com/photos/rockandrollfreak/15574342528/in/photostream/lightbox/               No, Burlington.

 Moar!!!    You know when people are trying to scare you and they put on a frightened face and say "There's something behind you." Well my one of my friends, whom I will call Maria keeps telling me to look behind me, and of course I don't because I don't want to play her stupid game.   So I decide that if I don't do what she says, she'll will drop it right? No, Maria wouldn't quit with that annoying sentence, and eventually that was all she would say to me on Facebook and when she texted me on her phone.  Then one day while i'm one my bed eating candy on my bed, Maria's mom calls and asks me if I had seen heard her. And when I ask her mom why, she tells me that Maria left to have a surprise sleepover with me. And after talking a while she tells me that she'll keep in touch and to call her if I see her, then she hangs up on me.  So I sit there letting the realization that my best friend went missing after coming to see me, and suddenly the sour worms that I threatened to come up again. So I rushed to the bathroom and through the door open, and after a few minutes of gagging, but I didn't throw up thankfully, I notice a banging sound coming from the front door so walk through the house to see who it is and it's just then that I notice how dark it was in there.   My parents weren't home and even though I wasn't afraid of the dark, the atmosphere in the house was enough to make me jump out of my skin. And all the while the banging on the door doesn't stop, so hesitantly I look through the peephole and i'm delighted to see Maria standing there impatiently waiting for me to open the door.  "Maria!" I exclaimed pulling my friend into a bear hug. She smiled and hugged me back, when she pulled back she gave me a puzzled look "Why didn't your parents answer the door?" she asked. Now it was my turn to be puzzled "What are you talking about, they aren't here." I told her not listening to anything else she was saying. She pointed outside and I poked my head from out the house, their car was there, but that doesn't make any sense. I thought I heard a car pull away. Maria's face is no longer relaxed and she grew rigid, "Stay there." She commanded, dropping her bags and running upstairs to my parents room.  I tried to call out to her, but she was already halfway up the stairs. I waited patiently until I heard a gasp escape from her lips, I ran upstairs myself, I tried to look into my parent's room, but Maria turned me around with trembling hands so that I couldn't see what was inside their room. But I still caught a glimpse of blood stained walls."Don't look behind you." Maria whispered in my ear, and I felt my stomach drop, I rushed into the bathroom in time to throw up my sour worms. I shook violently and choked as tears and vomit splashed into the toilet, somewhere in the distance I heard Maria calling her mother, crying as well. When Maria come into the bathroom to check on me, I lashed out on her "Why did you do!" I screamed at her. She backed up and told me to calm down, but I couldn't, she thought this was some game, well I was done playing.   I whipped out my phone and showed her the text messages of that sentence she kept texting me. She paled when I showed her the messages "What!" I screamed. She opened her mouth, then closed it, she collapsed on the tile of the bathroom floor before she spoke "I didn't send you that, my phone was taken away, that's the reason my mom didn't know where I was. That couldn't have been me." If I could have paled even more I would have, non of that made any sense! I grabbed Maria's hand and pulled her out the bathroom, we needed to get out of here. We had just made it outside when a police car pulled up with Maria's mom in the front. She jumped out the car and hugged us both.  My parents were viciously murdered, and the police found out who did it, but they didn't capture him yet. So Maria, her mom and I moved into another state, since I didn't have any relatives that wanted to take me in, it only made since that I live with them. But the reason I write to you is because recently, i've been getting text messages that bring up bad memories, and I don't think Maria has been sending them to me.       You-..... you drugged her!?   Dun dun daaaaaa!   I had one of those moments where I just stare off into space as the realization hits me, great story though!   I love it!   That ending... wow, I didn't expect that.   Just hmm, I really don't know what to say, this story is... interesting.   There are some things I can't handle, like being alone or walking through the house by myself. But I can't especially can't handle being in the dark, knowing that those really aren't shadows and that the basement isn't suppose to be dark, I know because I cut the lights on and shined my flashlight down there. But I also know this because the dark ate my parents.   Guys guys shhhh.... I know your all confused, but the best thing we can do is stare at the computer screen and wait until he posts something else. We shouldn't even blink too.   So is the tree good or evil?   Why didn't you not make the deal if he didn't tell you what it was about?   Don't die on us! Oh and stay safe.   Pretend that you are playing games then open the door and run like hell.   And just where were you hiding to find out all this stuff.  	15
 You use it as a fire starter by detonating it and using the flames it makes to start your very own campfire    Bye bye indestructible camera. Have fun sinking to the bottom of this lava- filled volcano where nobody can ever reach you again    I'd rather throw Joffrey in    I was going to say magic tricks too! But that's because in high school I thought it would be fun to learn how to do them and I've seen almost all the good card tricks already :( so they have lost their wonder for me    I giggled.    I know the roach is probably more terrified of me than I am of it  Let's be real here. Roaches fear nothing    I have a fear that if I eat hot food and then drink a cold beverage right after my teeth will shatter. Like a hot mug that gets ice water poured into it. Scares the crap outta me. Also makes it a real bitch to eat hot food.    Don't know if this counts cuz it was technically the blurb, but Elantris by Brandon Sanderson. Easily the best blurb I've ever read in my entire life.    I get my books almost exclusively from my county library. All the books there have dust jackets. I grew up loving dust-jacketed books and I will die loving dust-jacketed books.    **The warded man, by Peter V. Brett**   So I have 750 hours of not fun on my skyrim save? (and no life)       *nacho lucky day          Lmao   But the whole point is that it's offensive. Although I guess it does kind of go past offensive into tasteless...   That's why he said "but I'm not mean about it"  He would say something tactful. Like "it looks very very very bad"    Ah. You must be white.    Fuckin white people I swear   Oh God Southpark   	21
 No, just pay more attention to who you vote for beyond the president.    You over estimate the influence the governor has on jobs    Or they could go to the Sanders subreddit    What if it brings the state government profit?    What if I told you the other 2/3 of government would still be corrupt?    Or people could vote for the person they want, you know, the way democracy is set up to work. If you don't vote because you don't think your person will win, you're a terrible American    They're so mature that they don't read beyond titles and circle jerk sanders    Where's your wife titsmcgeee?    One of the best convo breakers I've seen on reddit    They want schools with large research budgets so they can collaborate. Colorado has a study with Wisconsin on why kids are dropping out of STEM. I've seen many recent studies at Colorado with Stanford and USC    Understood and I frequent the new section. At the same time why are many posts needed about the same thing? It discourages any diversity. If people want to talk about sanders crowd on multiple posts then there can go to the Sanders subreddit    OK I change it, $30 if he wins, $10 if he loses    No we don't.    I'm speaking relative to Wisconsin. If there was as much liberal trend as people think, walker wouldn't have been voted in three times. This was held in Madison, one of the country's most liberal cities. Unless you lived under a rock you heard about the protests in Madison when walker broke up unions. Walker survived still. One city does not represent an entire state.    Milwaukee will never be conservative. Simply said, that's where liberal voters live    But he went to Denver instead of Boulder. CU'S arena fits 10,000 people, he should've gone there. I saw Obama speak there a few years ago    His plans are pretty general too.   So what? Why do you need more than one post saying he had a big crowd    It was coincidence that it's gameday countdown tweet today    [He won't win] (http://www.businessinsider.com/can-bernie-sanders-beat-hillary-clinton-2015-7). Before I get downvoted to the depths of hell, who wants to place a wager? If Sanders wins the primary, I'll donate $25 (I'm a broke college student and Sanders likes small donations) to his campaign. If he doesn't make it, $25 will be donated to the GOP that wins the primary by whoever takes me up on this.   Edit- wow I would've expected someone to take me up on this by now. I guess Sanders supporters aren't as confident as they appear       I'm already subscribed, but it goes by the name /r/politics       Calling on the mods to do some regulation. All the top posts are about the crowd. Do we really need that many posts to tell us sanders had a big crowd? It's spamming, it's karma whoring, it's unnecessary.    Keep in mind this state elected Walker twice and he survived a recall. This crowd doesn't mean much    The top 4 posts on the sub are the same exact thing, sanders got a big crowd. Do we really need that many posts? Quit spamming    "Reddit conversation is beyond controlled" Example /r/politics    [CNN] (http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/01/politics/bernie-sanders-crowds-wisconsin-2016/) [Huffington Post] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/01/bernie-sanders-madison_n_7709966.html) [MSNBC] (http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/bernie-sanders-draws-biggest-crowd-any-2016-candidate-yet)   1990 Mizzou  1990 Notre Dame  2001 Nebraska  [1994 Michigan] (http://imgur.com/HdoQjek)      At 62-22 CSU will always be little bro    We have caves and mines.   They can have the Bomber Game. Air Force drops bombs, New Mexico is where bombs are set off    Well we have plenty of one popular plant.  Also high altitude = better skiing. This season ran October to June    Attendance has been bad and Colorado needs more home games since some years they only have 4 home conference games.    That's the excuse. When CU was snubbed they lost in the semis of the NIT, then won the pac tournament the following year so they couldn't be snubbed again   Well the showdown is no longer. CSU won't agree to a 2-1 series and so CU has scheduled TCU, Nebraska, Texas A M    We have UW and WSU, Oregon and OSU, Arizona and ASU. There's a trend    The bitched about being left out and lost the first NIT round    And smaller    Pretty sure king of the mountain would consist of CU, CSU, Utah, Utah State, BYU, Wyoming    Hollywood    Colorado would probably be Vail Resorts. 1/2 off admission to a game when you show your epic pass!    CSU didn't make the tournament    Only on Tuesdays    Don't worry, 2020 is closer than 2010   I'm taller,  but less money    Houston? If they're actually considered    White people- 50% native Colorado, 20% from California, 20% from Texas, 10% other    Bono?    Or it snows in September    Why do you care? You're moving to the G5   No. Utah St and Colorado St to big 12.    In some areas, I'm just surprised it wasn't mentioned as criteria    Nothing about academics?  I think they were generous on basketball. CSU lost the best players from last year if I remember correctly and that year was an outlier. They complain about being snubbed and then lose in the first NIT round. That's just poor attitude. Colorado was snubbed a few years ago then  lost in the NIT semis. To prevent being snubbed they won the pac tournament the following year.  Geography gave me a laugh. Yes Colorado boarders a big 12 state and used to be a big 12 state, but it's not any easy drive. It's 8 hours of boring flat land from Kansas. I think CU BIG 12 history is the only reason geography was scored so high.    Cu and CSU haven't been doing well with the neutral site series and it's ending in a few years, ending the rivalry    [this might have something to do with it] (http://espn.go.com/ncf/gamecast?gameId=400548263 version=mobile gcSection=boxscore src=desktop)   Denver Broncos    Canada day eh?   You'd like Boulder. They're converting entire traffic lanes into bike lanes.    Really? I saw the plans a few months ago but didn't see it go through until today    I gained weight    At the bar a guy kept bumping into me pretty hard. I know accidental bumps happen in crowds but it was more than that. I tell him "hey can you try not to bump into me so much". There's a girl there he's hitting on that I never even looked at. He decides to get all tough with words and starting to shove. Looks over at his friend who then comes over. These guys are around 5' 10". I laugh and turn to my friends.  6'3", 6'6", 6' 8". The 6'8" guy is easily 250lbs. The guy backed off when he realized who I was with.       Get a shift that starts at 4am   Split up    It's a great department from my experience. One of the larger ones. I took bio 1   2 with respective labs.    Because the SEC won't travel west.    Pick one your interested in. Human diversity classes are fucking easy    Simply put without legal terms, 99% of juries won't blame you for helping the child.   Did my clinical there. 10 hour shifts if I remember correctly.    That's not much. Colorado has $115 million being spent on academic buildings this year. That doesn't include the labs/clinics in the athletic facility    And eat less hot food    The manlinest man    Flood lights = porch lights   Reddit?   We lose faith    I saw Strangers in a black theatre with only 10 people there. Best movie experience ever.    "my ears have been ringing all day"         They do have the big 10 game every year, there's hope.    So close in many games last year  Spruce  Jim Leavitt  Hawaii bowl game rule  Ten years is long enough    I know this is old because the brewers won on the ticker    Now you have to tell us which calls were yours.    Me. 25 years ago.    You'd think Colorado would be better with a coach and player on this team    I never heard about the tournament until this year, perhaps someone could explain it more. Colorado has an alumni team, games start July 10th and Colorado plays July 11th. Games are live streamed with the final 17 being shown on ESPN U, and the last 3 games on ESPN. Colorado roster includes Beau Gamble, Jeremy Adams, Sabatino Chen, to name a few.  Winning team gets $1,000,000 and registered fans get prizes ranging from a t-shirt to $5,000.       Had to be done. Looking forward to the big house next year    Go to CU, grew up in Wisconsin, so I have enjoyed many nights on State Street    [One of my favorite covers] (http://i.cdn.turner.com/si/multimedia/photo_gallery/1011/hail.mary.finishes/images/michael-westbrook-006274083.jpg)   They also had a winning record in a major city with a less active population    "In place of seven tax brackets, there would be one (with a generous standard deduction for the first $50,000 of income). In place of hundreds of credits, deductions and other loopholes, there would be only a handful."   Because they circulate like crazy on Facebook and soccer moms believe them    Then don't read the post, no one is forcing you   You under estimate the amount of people that go to the ER and don't pay. Plus, the majority of cases in the ER could be seen by primary care or urgent care instead   Also ERs are required to treat you if your life is in danger. That means everyone has access to emergency care if they can get to an ER          Well seperating marriage from government is a step    Renew the rivalry!! It would take a lot to be rivals again    Damn it, I didn't know it was cancelled    His personal beliefs don't reflect his politics.    Obviously staged but still a cool thing          I've gained plenty of fat. 30lbs in 3 months.   For Colorado, reverse followed by Spruce touchdown pass to Sefo  http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=11843943   Colorado making a bowl game    No, a team of first round draft picks couldn't even win it all          Can confirm, see flair. I don't even have a gut    I'm 6'4" and have gained nearly 30lbs. It's not near as noticeable as your 20. Weird    It was, I helped others make the connection    Hawaii is a few hours behind and can't play the game until after class gets out    You may have missed what I was referring to. In the 4th CU recruit post a Nebraska site had listed CSU as being in the springs. So CSU is now Colorado Springs University    I don't think consent should be required if there is reason for search. Does a guy match the description of one from a theft? Search for the item. Random stop and search should be consent based but appropriate suspicion should be enough to base a search on.       Breaks between plays    http://youtu.be/qv3zHT60Hbs   Probably people who didn't read the title       She should've just done a blood glucose test to confirm your levels, just a needle prick   Nearly a decade of losing records, daytime games, the most active population in the country.  Simply said, most people would rather hangout in the mountains than watch a football team lose    Lack of. If it didn't take so damn long to get our first recruit then no one would care.    Colorado Springs University deserves a few votes since they also have Air Force Academy in town    Take 20% off of the per capita and it's only 1,000 more than Norway. That 20% doesn't include cardiovascular disease which can be attributed to lifestyle choices.  [heart disease and diabetes make up $600 billion in healthcare expenses] (http://www.forahealthieramerica.com/ds/impact-of-chronic-disease.html).    Burners for the hoes   That is correct but we're comparing to more developed countries. Also the rate is increasing in the US and it's predicted that 3/4 of Americans will be overweight or obese in the next 5 years. Something so easily fixed by people fixing themselves has taken over the country.    I'm a bit late but [see for yourself] (https://vimeo.com/106998948).  Boulder is very unique    Someone's never tried running a Mile High    One vote and this wouldn't even be a discussion. They knew about the 5th Down and clipping when they voted.    CU, CSU, Air Force. Just follow the rockies and you'll hit all 3   Colorado should have never joined the pac 12    Colorado basketball has a ridiculous home court advantage, likely because you don't have stops in play. 0.690 all time, 90% under coach Boyle    In our case, what are they doing Wed before the 11pm mountain time game Thursday?    Similar note I Think CU has the highest elevation of p5 teams at 5,360ft. Denver Broncos are highest in the NFL and where 2/3 longest field goals have occurred       Too much work, just like exercise    0-69 real quick    Yes we can! Yes we can!   	142
 ...well played.            Great, thanks. I'll post this in the Atlanta and dragoncon subreddits this evening.   I'm sure there is, but I haven't looked.       I work with your brother at Jimmy John's. Small world.   Right on. Will do.   Sweet! I'll start a thread on r/Atlanta this weekend once I figure out a good time and place.   I'm thinking about organizing a Reddit meet-up at D*Con this year. Would you be interested?   I was considering organizing a Reddit meet-up for Dragon*Con. Would you be down?

 Most of those shoes aren't mine. Haha! But I see your point!   They're almost impossible to see now.   Most of those shoes aren't mine. haha!    I usually have to tell them who I am.    That's not a very nice thing to say. I was in the middle of a terrible hormonal imbalance that sent my estrogen levels through the roof. So yeah, I look more feminine there, but it's not natural.   Keep it up! Trust me, it sucks at first but you can only get better if you try. I enjoy running about 90% of the time now. Haha!   He sleeps in the bed with me now. Haha! I was keeping him in my studio for a while so my pups wouldn't get him.   The stretch marks that appeared on my belly. ugh.   It was from switching birth controls. My body had to adjust to it. Thanks!   I don't have any loose skin, thank goodness, but the stretch marks are still there. They are almost impossible to see though. I have to be in certain lighting and stretch my skin a certain way for them to be visible. I used red light therapy, and tretinoin cream to help make them less noticeable.   That's cool. I feel pretty badass. Thanks!   THANKS!!! :D   Exactly.   It was cardio cardio and more cardio. Those two places were my biggest issues too and I just had to keep running. I'm still working on them too. There's no way to just single out one section of your body to get rid of fat in that one area. It takes a lot of hard work and patience. Thanks! :D   Facebook started to get really creepy. I was getting messages from all these guys that I went to high school with...I had to block them. There comes a point when you pass compliments into creepy inappropriate comments.    uh...yes?   Thank you so much! :D   Not really. I'm not really into shoes that much, I have two pars of sneakers, two pairs of sandals, and a pair of chucks.   About 90% of women are fucking mean to my face now. Men are usually really nice and kids love me. I get glared at a lot now, and I've been called a skinny bitch for no reason other than existing. I think I'm a typically nice person and It's really weird being treated so different for taking care of myself now.   I did keto for over a year. I'm sorta a carb nazi now because of it, but I don't go out of my way to avoid them...usually. Yesterday, I went to a cook out and I had some corn chips but I didn't have a bun on my hotdog. So I just know what I'm eating now and I'm really careful with everything. haha! Thanks!  	20

Tl;dr- Do I upgrade or keep my pioneer hdj 500s?  Edit: Ended up buying these before the price increase, burned them in for 12 hours overnight and I'm definitely happy.

So, I've been taking a karate class for seven years and just next week I'm getting the chance to be tested for brown belt.  I will be testing with at least one other person, possibly my sister. I've been thinking about quitting for a while because my sensi (teacher) doesn't seem to be taking this class as seriously as he used to. One reason I don't want to take the test is that I WILL get hurt somehow, it might be because of getting punched, being slashed with a knife, or I could be hit by pole, but every single person who has taken the test has been injured in one way or another.  On the same day as the test, The Monkees are starting off their reunion tour, and It would be an amazing experience. The venue where they are playing is only forty-five minutes away from where I live, but where they are going to be playing after that is about seven hours away, in New Jersey.  	22

 yup, here it is, my ~/.i3/config: http://pastebin.com/BSqZFpUY   no, that didn't work...same behavior.   Okay, so I've been using i3 for a while and love it, but I have one issue I still have yet to resolve that bothers me.  I use 9 workspaces and they are usually all filled with something, be it terminals or a web browser or whatever.    If I am on one workspace, say workspace #3, and I want to move a window from it to workspace #5 (there are already things on workspace #5) then mod + Shift + 5 on the selected window creates a NEW #5 workspace instead of putting it on the existing 5th workspace, so now I have 2 "#5" workspaces.  Ideally I would like it to move the window to the existing workspace #5.  Any ideas as to how to accomplish this?  Thanks.   free as in beer, or free as in speech?

 She's got *serious* issues. I suppose she deserves our sympathy for whatever abuse must have happened to her.    That's worse than prison food. Take my word for it.    i agree, and thanks for that.  yes, i use "impossible" to describe how it appeared to me, and a bit loosely.  true that it shouldn't be used to actually mean "impossible", you're right.  trying to get to a new level of understanding regarding nature, and beauty, and why the negative *seems* to be only in the domain of man.  tidal waves are beautiful and positive until they kill people, etc.....      yes, and we're going to have to finish off the close games.  most of these should be close at the end, and we're going to have to put them away, make free-throws, don't foul, attack the basket, all that.   In the world of words, atheism is often, maybe always, the flip-side of theism. But what were we when we were born?  Beliefs and belief systems shouldn't be reduced to categories and concepts. Yes it makes them easier to argue and discuss, but also obscures their real nature, thereby making discussion about them less simple, and tends to make it about words. The discussion can be fun and can continue for its own sake, but we aren't really talking about the real nature of belief.    We should take it to another level and incorporate this in the discussion, instead of remaining in the world of abstractions.    Your vote doesnt really matter. If it did it would be illegal.   Have we really had any real choice these last elections anyway? Not much.   You can vote with your wallet for one corporation or another.    You are refuting (successfully or not) his points, but aren't venturing into the real argument at all.  Perhaps make a positive point of your own regarding the OP.  It is relatively easy to argue semantics and logic and abstractions when one only seeks to rebut the claims of others in the very limited medium of reddit.   This is only a suggestion.    Because they think it is a hard science.   They see it as a mechanism and not an organism.   And they are connected to the government.    Look at most governments if the world, including the US. Is that really what you see?  "Theoretically bound" only means shrouded in secrecy, lies, and politics. Governments actually steal and kill *far, far more* than any other entity or organization.   Also, are you really saying that corporations dont own the US government?  Why no prosecutions of banksters, only billions in bailouts?   And it assumes rational economists.    it says he's a wealthy insurance executive. I'm sure if somebody looked into it they'd find he donated to the police union at some point.  money is the only reason for this.  EDIT: no, i didn't read the whole article where, i guess this is made obvious   iTunes went to shit when Steve Jobs died. Everything they've done since is making it worse. If it's not boke, don't fix it!   I don't know about Williams, but I'm not *unsold* on Cooper.  For this reason primarily:  Cooper would allow Carr to realize a far greater potential.  Carr has all this ability that is untapped because of the offense around him (and the play calling last year).  We would get more value from Cooper because there would be so much offensive synergy with Carr that we wouldn't get with Williams.   That's just going to make them hate us even more.   Scared, depressed.....*and bored*.   Why couldn't he do that in 2009?      it's not just the city.  i hiked up to the top of Angels Landing in Zion NP a couple weeks ago.  it was like spring break up there.  about 80 obnoxious college kids saying the stupidest stuff, lowest common denominator frat house kind of stuff.  they were all around me on this narrow piece of rock amidst a beautiful setting.  it was impossible for me to accept that their nature was one with the nature i was in.  everything about them disrespected nature and their fellow hikers.  i still haven't been able to reconcile this at all - that is, reconcile the nastiness and lowness of some people with the purity and beauty and simplicity and integrity of the non-human world.   Taoism doesn't involve "ideals", but I know what you mean.   No one ever said it was an answer, and most would call it a song.   Exactly.  [Here is a good lecture on the subject.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oyyXC5IzEE noredirect=1)  None of the proponents for it in the above comments can say *why* it is such an important tool or rule of thumb, even though they readily acknowledge it shouldn't be overused, etc.   lame   Not good.  When will these developers get a clue and stop hiring her?  In 10-15 years the regret will sink in.   nothing has inherent value. not gold, not money, not architecture. also, there is a difference between architecture and building. but there are definitely different types of subjective value and potential subjective value. the investment in real estate is an investment in a real thing. whereas investment in something like education isnt quite as real. tangible is probably a better word than real. buildings are shelter. shelter is one of man's primary needs. therefore buildings have a value to man. but if there are too many buildings, they might be less valuable. but it is not inherent value. it is still subjective value that is given it by people.    charles baudelaire the beats   i appreciate that. ive been a christian most of my life but now dont believe it anymore. im a big fan of soren kierkegaard. but god is just beyond reach. as if he isnt even there.    ok thats good to hear. bloodline got more tense and suspenseful as it went on too.    reminds me of the road to the future (never-never land, nowhere, where ever) in Obama's 'O' logo.   Thanks.  Yes, I started to watch Damages, but the NYC aspect was exactly what kind of put me off.  Some humanity gets lost in simply setting it there instead of the Keys or somewhere with more character.  I'll probably give it another try though.  Bloodline set a high bar.   Why do they need to wait a couple days to interview him?  So everyone has time to coordinate the story, and find out what the public and witnesses saw, etc.?      Yeah, I know.  I remember how that first hit me as well.  Love that poem.   Baudelaire's "[Eyes of the Poor](http://www.iub.edu/~paris10/ParisOSS/D3Haussmann/d2baudelairepoor.htm)" is a very INTJ prose-poem.  The Cure made a song out of it called "How Beautiful You Are".   Was going to say the exact same thing.   And don't let other people have any control of your happiness. I know it is not that easy, but with time you will no doubt get there.     yes. i like the unpredictability of it all and how it seemed to surprise even john. but im sad that danny is dead. he was the best. but kevin has actually been freaking excellent in my opinion too.    wondering if it is as good as bloodline was, and worth the time to watch it.    because we understand ideas so well. we can clearly tell people about them.   because we are autodidacts for the most part, we have really, really learned. i think this makes is better teachers too.   we dont care as much about the execution, the practical, making it happen, so we sometimes dont see fruition for ourselves.    Bob Dylan's music (the lyrics are definitely poetry) has had a huge impact on my life.     Charles Baudelaire - Elevation  Above the lakes, above the vales, The mountains and the woods, the clouds, the seas, Beyond the sun, beyond the ether, Beyond the confines of the starry spheres, My soul, you move with ease,  And like a strong swimmer in rapture in the wave  You wing your way blithely through boundless space  With virile joy unspeakable. Fly far, far away from this baneful miasma  And purify yourself in the celestial air,  Drink the ethereal fire of those limpid regions  As you would the purest of heavenly nectars. Beyond the vast sorrows and all the vexations That weigh upon our lives and obscure our vision, Happy is he who can with his vigorous wing Soar up towards those fields luminous and serene, He whose thoughts, like skylarks, Toward the morning sky take flight  Who hovers over life and understands with ease The language of flowers and silent things!   2012-13.    Yeah, I was surprised he didn't mention facebook, where everyone is hyper-happy and nothing but smiles are allowed.   Don't feel bad about it though.   Well, tell us, what is the other side?  You're picking a very bad example with which to make your point.  In fact, it doesn't even count as an example.   Right, it has to do with time, change, growth, life/death, etc.   So it's now news when a cop *doesn't* assault or kill someone.   There is a false idea that INTJs aren't emotional, and this gets perpetuated.  INTJs start to see themselves as, and identify with, how they think others see them.  This is bogus.  The wiki on INTJs even states that we are one of the most sensitive of the types.  We don't wear it on our sleeves, however.    because I believe the Bible is inspired by God  Seems to be circular reasoning.  That you are a Christian because you believe, and vice versa.  What is the nature of God?  Does it/he have a nature or is it more of a concept?  If he has a nature and character, is it that described in the Bible?  If so, why is his love not really anything like that described?  That is, love should be immediate and demonstrable, not mysterious and conditional, especially the love of the great Father, God.      No, he was an accessory.     this same defense is tried and true for killer cops.  johannes mehserle said the same thing when he shot the guy on the subway platform in oakland years ago.   all their faces are blocked with white squares.  do the bad guys get black squares?   The side that destroyed the artifacts.  The other side was the artifacts.   A couple years ago we had pretty much the best bench in the league.   Just get a new book and light it on fire.    "puts police in an impossible situation" = the gift that keeps on giving to the police-prison system, perpetual money and jobs for everyone.   chelsea had a couple if the most insightful lines too. one was, "as soon as you give someone else control of your happiness, you're fucked."  and she had another good one about not trying to change people.    we got the message without them having to show it. didnt need it.   we got a ten second look at dannys boy and learned all we needed to about their relationship. effeciency is good and the audience dont need to be spoon fed.    i was sick when john killed him. a movie/tv show hasnt made me that sad since Barnes killed Elias in Platoon.    yep absolutely freaking perfect.    Yes and Carlos is still loose. Though John threatened to kill him if he came back.    i like kevin too. thought his acting incredible. but all the kids were excellent.    i put this way above sopranos. and even above breaking bad. the last four episodes were non stop suspense. acting and writing were virtually perfect. and i loved breaking bad.    your first one is a damn good theory.    yeah dont be fooled. what danny says and what danny does are two different things.    yes, i think so. he wanted john to live with the guilt of having killed someone, just like he did (even though he didnt kill sarah, he was blamed.)   what id like to know is who was going through the envelopes of money. we dont see their face. it looked like a woman's hands. then the paper is found with 'john rayburn' written on it.    i thought it was danny's son. around to torment the rayburns for another series. along with potts.   but then why the rayburn hotel shirt? that was meant to tell us it was carlos, no?   i would recommend NOT reading it. i did. it was a joke. found it to be totally pretentious and definitely written by someone who doesnt know architecture like he wants us to think he does. didnt get anything more from it - literally.    That chain link fence probably saved him, *and* the video, from the cops.    What, is the police union money not enough?!   Oh ok.   What does that mean?                              ....Unless you are a crack baby born to a prostitute and chained in a basement for decades.    "God" isn't shorthand for "the cause", or the "unexplainable other" - at least as he describes himself in the Bible.  You'll notice that most people find sunsets beautiful, when they see them.  For another person to come along and state that that person is really talking about God, whether they know it or not, is quite a leap.  Certainly God wouldn't count this as a declaration of faith, and grant him salvation and eternal life, and why not?  Etc.  We each need to ask ourselves who/what/where is God *for me*.  Not what does CS Lewis or Pascal or Aquinas or Dawkins say, but *what do I say*.  There are arguments for God, but they aren't anything close to personal manifestations of God.  We don't, and shouldn't, need a book or a text or a tradition or an institution to bring us to God.  In fact, this common and strong tendency for conflation might be a clue as to whether he is there or not.  The medium isn't the message.  Nor is faith itself to be confused with faith *in something*.  Faith in what?  Faith itself?  The unknown?  For starters, let's look at his claims in the Bible of who he is:  among these, a loving father.  If I loved my kids as he appears to love me, my kids would A. Not know me (but they must have faith, because that's how I set up the rules, just because) B. Be estranged from me (but I love them mysteriously, at a distance, in ways they can't comprehend, mostly because they sin so much, and because I'm so much *greater* than them, and beyond their comprehension)  I won't try to make myself known, or make them experience my love in a way they can't deny, *even though I'm their father*, and this would be easy, if not automatic, for me. C. Probably develop and antipathy toward me.  And this is a real, earthly father, someone they can see and talk to directly!   haha. good one!   the most extreme would be the day when i was 21, and for no apparent reason i didnt believe there was a god anymore. it happened so fast and was so undeniable and came from some other place - maybe from everywhere. that is, not from my surroundings or my consciousness. it shook me. i dont know what prompted it but will never forget it. nothing like it has happened before or since.    this is the "glory of god" that we only experience through faith? that is, it is only there if you believe in it. that is, it may not be there and if it is, it must not be that glorious.   no one is trying to diminish god's glory anyway. besides, to me it is about whether he exists or not. how much glory he has is a triviality.    strange. it was on the guardian's front page today.             Don't take a scholar's word for it. Read it yourself.   It is anything but a political book.    This isnt about how to govern. It is about all the bad things that happen due to the delusion of government.    General Ts'ao's rule over the state of Ch'i in about 200 BC. His chief advisor was a philospher and follower of Lao Tzu. He advised him to do nothing, and the people flourished under his "rule".  Alan Watts addresses this toward the end of "The Watercourse Way".    Yes, something like teaching by example even. The best learning is deeper and more unconscious than the direct transfer and/or memorization of concepts.   Ive been lately struggling with this same stuff. Hiked up to Angels Landing in Zion National Park a couple weeks ago. Was surrounded by dozens of college kids on spring break, and one large church group of college kids. They had absolutely zero regard for their fellow hiker and zero appreciation of the beauty around them. Extremely annoying and obnoxious. To me there seemed such a chasm betwen the nature I was in and the nature of these people around me.  Was trying to find compassion, without condescension or arrogance. Couldnt find compassion at all. Or even understanding.       ....and that you are not a farmer.       i made my point long ago.  all you do is misdirect.  that's not hip.      go flip yourself.   ....and HIGH taxes.    im talking only about your endorsement of peer pressure as a method.    scientology is one of those things where a "by any means necessary" approach isn't that necessary.  if you're on the inside, you've drunk the kool-aid.   what i was getting at is that trying to get people to do things because it "isn't cool" is actually counter productive.  it encourages herd mentality, people behaving like frat boys (as the police do).  the right thing to do is often *not* what is hip.   one should explain to another the reasons why they should lose and idea, based on substance, not by telling them it isn't hip or whatever.   you need to lose this idea that "hip" is better than unhip. think for yourself. who cares what others think is cool? that's just another type of cult behavior.    i dont like scientology either. but you are encouraging a herd mentality and not trusting people to think for themselves. you are saying that making something cool or shameful is a good way to achieve a desired behavior.   this is in fact something that promotes cult behavior in the first place: people doing something for acceptance, because it is cool, or to avoid shaming or ridicule. people need to think rationally for themselves, whether the herd is with them or not. rational, sensible, substantive arguments should be made in an environment that welcomes it.   otherwise, you are just promoting a "good cult" to take the place of a "bad cult": "you aren't "hip" because you dont believe X Y and Z like the we do". THIS is what the world doesnt need.    Tough one. Between Bo Jackson, Lawrence Taylor, and Randy Moss for me.    Merrill and his big tie knot drive me nuts, but he is right a lot.    The Republicans only claim to be for limited government. And it turns out they are only talking about domestic policy. Outside our borders they are for unlimited government (theft and waste).  The left is just the other side of this coin- no better.    This is one of the funniest comment threads Ive ever seen on reddit.    Constantly.   More anarchist.

Check out the movie "Harry Dean Stanton: Partly Fiction" on Netflix. He drops a lots of Taoism throughout. Numerous clips are also on youtube.

The link was removed, but in the comments are some torrent links to download.  I did this and watched it.   So you think it is obvious that Andy Goldworthy's art is just "nature stuff" and "autumn leaves", and nothing more.  You are caricaturing my post, and reducing it (I actually didn't say anything specifically about what makes it Taoist) to "the obvious".  Your problem with people stating the obvious is actually a problem you have with yourself repackaging and reducing something you think you see to be "the obvious".  *There are innumerable aspects of depth and variation and complexity to Goldsworthy's art.  This goes without saying.  This is pointing out the truly obvious - which you are either denying or are ignorant of.*  You imply that I'm missing how Taoism applies to our daily lives.  Actually, I'm expanding our realization of how Taoism applies to our daily lives.  Further, I can't cover everything in just one post.  I'll get to the rest of our daily lives eventually.  Your own comments argue against themselves and waste peoples' time.   I hadn't thought of that.  I see a lot of yin yang.  Gradients, play between artificial and natural.  Also, addresses temporality and change and growth, life and death; and some play with the "uncarved block" and the "watercourse way".  Among other things.   How generous?  As generosity increases does desire to work increase as well?  Or only up to a point (say, $1,000/hour), after which desire to work then decreases?   "Remarkably stable"?  The dollar has only lost 96% of it's value in the 102 years since the Fed was created.   nicholson lived up at mulholland drive. maybe four miles or more away. why would he also have lived near the playboy mansion? article doesnt say where this other house was supposed to be. bad reporting.      no.  we're talking past each other.  you seem to always revert to something like: "everything is taoist."    the banner to this subreddit needs to state that we all know the tao that is spoken is not the true tao, but we are going to speak anyway - just as lao tzu and chuang tzu did....  that that is the starting point.  otherwise you get these feedback loops like we are in now, when commenters like you keep repeating this mantra.  i wonder what your point is and why you even bother with this subreddit.   i dont disagree much at all with that.  only, to me, some things are more taoist and others less taoist- but only in our perception/conception of them. for instance, some books are very taoist, some explicitly so. other books are very non/un-taoist- books about scientology, for instance. though they think they are different and have a certain view, they actually cant help but adhere to the taoist principles, as you say. i suppose, then, that i mean the un taoist stuff wrongly views itself a certain way, when it cant help but be taoist. the disharmony comes only in this misconception and not in the actuality of the thing itself. this is why taoism is so refreshing: people find it was there along along. so i think a lot of art and literature is neutral on the matter, but goldsworthy's work struck me to be especially expressing ghe yin yang in a unique way. also growth, time, change, flow. one could potentially draw parallels to the watercourse way and the uncarved block, but id be careful there.   if that makes sense. im in a hurry...   ive been an a's fan since the late 80's. those great years. not a warriors fan though (clippers).    i really appreciate that. and quite agree with you. especially about over-application of the word tao, etc.   What are we even talking about then? This subreddit should be called "everything". 'The Tao of Poo' should be called 'The Tao of Pooh and Daffy Duck and Tracy Emin and Everything Else".   People who come on this subreddit and pretend they are wise and adding to a discussion by saying "the Tao is everything" need to get a clue.   Right, Taoism is in everything.    What about what Goldsworthy *does* with the nature stuff?     The Way would necessarily include art and the making of art - and the experience and perception of art.  Art is about a lot more than just aesthetics, and really doesn't even have to have aesthetic qualities, per se.  (I would argue that *good* art does, but that's another story.)   The NSA/FBI/Obama/CIA aren't going to like that.   No, it is not just nature and a bunch of circles.  For one, nature doesn't do those kinds of things without the hand of man involved (yeah, I know man is nature too). I could write a whole page on the Taoist aspects of this, but something tells me it would be a waste of time.       ha!   i have had the same thing with my ENFP/J girlfriend. i was using he word "autonomy" a lot, to no avail. she didnt want to give me space or time. was somewhat possessive and controlling. but like you, i would feel very drained at times and unable to recharge. i dont understand why some people cant handle the autonomy of another. fear of this or that i suppose.    im not about to read all that. for you to even care that much what i think is looney.    All the definitions (that I've come across) of co-dependency seem overly complex and/or overly vague.  Can anyone give me, or point me to, a concise and clear and thorough definition of co-dependency?  Thanks!   Successful compared to what?  The landing of the Hindenberg?   yeah, diplomacy game.  exactly.  all to hide the corruption that goes on there.    further, you pose a false choice:  either the UN or war?  how about nothing, no war *and* no UN.     some people make a religion out of skiing.    i would first read alan watts "tao - the watercourse way". he is a gifted writer, explains taoism extremely well. there is a free version on scribd. it is the best intro book by far, in my opinion.   also listen to his "philosophy of taoism" lectures on youtube.    not enforced in california.    ha. yeah, or "it was a fumble".   Welcome to the religion of NdGT. Downvote this comment to proclaim your faith!   i wouldnt listen to it at all, probably.   i cant listen to it. i like tbone but dont think this does justice to dylan.    You gotta read Ken Kesey's classic: One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest  The movie was incredible too.   INTJ      sure, but it now seems you could be trying to overwhelm me with info and links, etc.  we are all speaking the same language.  truth is supposed to be simple.   im still on vacation and will get to these when finished.  i generally think this sort of scientific and apparently thorough approach doesnt get SK and what he said on a very basic level. but i hope to take a closer look later.    in short: the immediate is unmediated. and what is on the other side of the chasm (the one some say they leap across) is absolutely unknown, if the chasm even exists....   exactly   he runs circles arounds us all.  i read the first 3 of OP's objections/replies and found them to be thoroughly lacking, not convincing in the least. the first was a total non sequitur. in fact, they convince/remind me of the strength, depth, and profundity of SK more than anything.    how do we know it is irrational? how do we know anything on the other side of the leap - especially if we havent taken it yet? with our rational minds?   yeah, a great self-serving *political* strategy.   finally got around to it....         All those who thought otherwise were branded 'Vitamin D skeptics', shamed for daring to doubt "science", not given tenure, and ridiculed on social media.   	164

I usually only masturbate every few days, but now whenever I am fucking reminded that the female gender exists, so much blood flows into my dick that it fucking hurts.   Nope. No taper.    around half a year   I was on 14 mg of Ativan a day, and my psychiatrist decided to take me completely off of it.

If you eat a calorie surplus due to this really cool cheese that I found at Trader Joes, you will gain just as much weight as with an identical calorie surplus caused by an episode of wearing carb goggles. The ketogenic diet is a good tool because being in ketosis induces a loss of appetite. It sounds like you're experiencing emotional eating, meaning you eat even when you are not hungry. You need to face your fears and grow some balls (wait you are female so that saying will not motivate you). Just track your macros. Fuck. Alright. I don't think my text will motivate you, so I will have to motivate you some other way.

He is a famous poet. He learned that nobody really likes to read poetry anymore, so he decided to form this great band called the Smashing Pumpkins and release his poetry in the form of song.    He is always watching.   Cool. Seriously, you don't want to upset Billy.   okay I honestly don't know what the fuck you mean by "rev up ketosis." stop. eat less than 20 grams of carbs a day and be sure to eat in a large calorie deficit.

It takes a while to detox.  Calories are a *limit,* not a goal. If you're not hungry, don't eat.   I have been diagnosed with anorexia and have struggled with bulimia (no formal diagnosis), so I know my shit.     why put all this work into cooking when you can just eat meat and cheese. I just think of hunger as an annoying ex-girlfriend now   it's really hard to increase calories after you get used to a certain amount. I got diagnosed with anorexia even though I don't have body dysmorphia. I just procrastinated increasing calories. lol mental hospitals suck   are you srs      Probably The Brothers Karamazov cover as it says "The Brothers Karamazov" on it.   fucking lol   *Stop*!

Seriously fuck this series. first they kill off my favorite comic book character, now they're going to harm my Barbs.    SCARECROW LEAVE HER ALONE! I WILL BREAK MY ONE RULE JUST FOR YOU, BUDDY!   please no spoilers, but i am at the part where Scarecrow threatens my Barbs. she is like a daughter to me. if she gets hurt, I'm fasting for at least a month. I'm not scared of being hospitalized for anorexia again.    well it didn't work. I just examined my balls, and guess what?   THEY ARE INTACT  your tricks won't work on me, Two-Face.   I am really proud of The Witcher 3. I have the slipcover and everything, no big deal, no big deal.   there was no pm, sorceress. pls stahp being a meanie. i get intimidated easily.   alright. I like bodybuilding, but I don't jerk myself to this competitive shit    no i did *not,* you harlot. pics or negs.   oh fuck. no I don't mean it like that. you can't even if you wanted to, as I don't have a cunt.   phrases sometimes have multiple meanings. For example, "look at that sick cunt" could mean "look at that ripped guy," "there is a really sick woman over there. she probably needs to get checked out. like at the hospital or something," or "take a look at that douche right there."   ok I got it. thanks for not being a jerk    so far my collection consists entirely of Xbox One games. I'm a really kool kat.   one of them is mulatto. one is really tan. one has tats, one doesn't have any visible. they are both like the same height. one really likes hats and has a wider smile. They both like tapered belts.   this is really hard, so stop being a meanie. not everyone is super duper smart like you. so just tell me which is which please, as I am really lost.   that's cute   wait which one is which... I get confused really easily, so don't eat me out   [spoiler now] SCARECROW LEAVE BARBARA ALONE! She has does nothing to you!   Please tell me Barbs is going to be safe. She's like a daughter to me.

IF YOU WEAR NIKES I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU   God... fuck this "Magoo" guy...   he is *so* yesterday   no that's a nish nish. im not bruno im straight dave   Please stop laughing. If Barbara hears you mocking her... she just might... ah... hurt herself.   Not funny. Depression is serious. Barbara needs to be protected from herself.   oh my god, we get it.    Yeah it's really fucking annoying how it's fucking impossible for Batman to complete a mission without the fucking batmobile. All of a sudden he is completely reliant on the batmobile when in the previous three games he didn't need it at all...   I mean, she really needs to be put on suicide watch.   wait you didn't put "no homo" after that.   you're confusing me.   I mean it worked for me. I used to be obese, then I got hospitalized for anorexia at 106 lbs. Works like a charm. Now I'm not *that* underweight.   Zero calories. If you want diet soda, coffee, etc. that's alright. If you accidentally ingest calories, you gotta throw it up.    I totally agree with you, but worry about living a healthy lifestyle *after* you get to a healthy weight. For now, you need to forget all that and fast whilst doing all the cardio you can.   obvious shitpost is obvious. even the "Magoo" fuckface isn't this bad   you're over 40% body fat, so it's time to start fasting until you're at a healthy weight. sorry, but you can't worry about muscle if you're obese. this is a crisis.   is it over 9,000   oh I'm sorry I'll shorten it. it'll just take a sec. hold on babe   to get bitches.   so far I have collected 9 female pugs. lifting is really working out for me   NO!   lolwhut   Saying Magoo is annoying is a nish nish all the way.   http://www.iphotoscrap.com/Image/769/1297087699.jpg   Not being up to date is a *definite* nish nish.   ok I'm confused   No. I swallow.    wtf? I'm not some $2 hooker. lol      ALMOST small... I wear an XS. HA!   TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS... inside the same... world...  whoa     Okay, I laughed. But I'm a guy, so making me laugh won't get you any poon.   	132
 Pffft, I can do this too.  I shall create MEAT VISION... He is a Super Hero who after a freak incident of eating an irradiated steak gains the power of being able to see meat through walls and over great distances. AS WELL AS being able to detect the age and quality of said meat.  Using his new found powers he works he way up the ranks within the Food Health and Safety administration. Along the way he meets and gains the adoration of Lisa the Receptionist at the FDA. But he can never reveal the secret to his uncanny ability to sense when bad meat is on the menu.  He also makes an arch nemesis: BUSH MEAT.   After a massive bust on an illegal meat importing operation of... you guessed it, bush meat. The ring leader BUSH MEAT will stop at nothing to get his vengeance. His powers include: spreading tainted meat throughout the city, hired goons, bribed politicians, health inspectors and police.  Get ready to follow the escapades of a super hero you never thought you wanted or even cared to think about:  MEAT VISION!   Yeah I know who he is, I was making a bad joke.

So I've been playing for a few years now, always on a Hohner Blues Harp MS or a Special 20 since they're cheap and effective.  Decided it was time to invest in something new and unique, so I saved up for the MR-550 and damn man... It's well worth it.

THERE WAS A FIREFIGHT!   HEY, SHUT UP DOWN THERE!   Two shots, one Absinthe the other a gun.   Pretty sure theres a Friday the 13th TV series reboot planned and a new game to go with it.   At least that's what read not too long ago.    \#spidermandonglover   Not even a nuclear shelter can keep you safe from bat-nipples.   Urkel Vs Screech   Oh but it is coming to the Vita.

CTR: Crash Team Racing was better than Mario Kart 64 in every way.  Track design, characters, weapons, graphics, sound, game modes... Everything was more polished and overall more fun.  Even now it stands the test of time better than Mario Kart 64.   Hollywood "remakes" a film scene for scene for their western audience, and no one bats an eye.  Anyone else "remakes" a film scene for scene for their particular audience (Asia, India etc) and Hollywood looses their fucken mind.  Guess it comes down to getting authorization / paying to be allowed to do so?   Because OP never delivers... [Here is the thread in question](http://www.reddit.com/comments/t0ynr)   Link to the original thread?   Pfft, aint no hookers there man, let alone any falling.   At least it doesnt say "Required content not yet purchased"    A FAN!? ARE YOU INSANE!  Dont you know that leaving a fan on overnight will push all the air out of the room and you'll suffocate!?   thought they slowly licked between your toes while locking eye contact?

It could be theoretically used for purposes other than detection of diseases.  Imagine you call work saying that you are sick, well not really... you just dont want to go to work today, so you call work and do your usual "I'm sick *cough cough*" routine... Your manager / boss will then be able to check the biometric data and immediately know if you are lying.  Or drug screening for over the phone for job interviews or applications for benefits...  Would also make an effective portable breathalyzer to test alcohol levels.  Or not.   Dont you give them to her in the hallway outside after the mission?  The one I gave her was when she was in the hospital ward.   Yeah I had already done that side quest.  This is after that, I was walking around taking to people and you hand her the one vial of Antizen and she says that it should be enough to get through the week.   Client side prediction, after the slow motion the game will speed up / slow down certain elements until everything is back in sync for all players.  Thats why there are sometimes jumps or skips afterwards, looks like lag but it isnt.   Heh, seems like I'm the only one that enjoys to dance around them...  Get in close and shank a few times then dash backwards or to the side, rinse and repeat.  late game it becomes harder as the range of their slam increases and a single dash will not evade it.  Still more fun than ranged combat, but to each their own.   "Clementine will remember that"   Theres a mission in Old Town where you have to get into an office building through the roof and it is controlled by Rais's men all with guns.  I didnt have any guns on me (had them in my stash) so I kept getting close, throwing fireworks onto the roof and running away.  Eventually a hoard of Volatiles came and bought their fury down upon the yellow wearing bastards.   You give that vial to the Doctor in the tower, well I did at least...     Also has plenty of Dudes in distress as well.  R.I.P Rahim.   Just make it a collection of intersecting stories from all the characters he met / had a history with and having John wick as a background / cameo character that ties it all together.   Basically make it Sin City in the John wick style/universe.   Just like Shoot Em Up. Stupid premise, all out action.    You're right, for distance thats a skip and a jump.   Heh, TIL what that hat is actually called. Thanks man.   Awesome, the Freddy Kruger one is my favorite.  Did a search for the artist, heres his site: [Rocky Davies](http://www.rockydavies.com/)   A lot of the subtitles dont match the actual speech, it's pretty common / standard in games for them to simplify the subtitles in order to fit more information in the small time frame they have it being displayed.  But this one in particular would be a translation issue, since the Devs are Polish.   Well I'm sure the 7 year old you would appreciate being Bart Simpson?    Why?... [Because](http://i.imgur.com/3swLquz.jpg)   Yeah EU/AU usually have a delay in games, be it physical or digital, but when the pre-load timer is counting down for 27/01/2015 and that is what was advertised on PSN... You sort of expect what is advertised dont ya think?  No one has the actual reason for the PSN screw up, some people claim Techland uploaded the wrong version of the game (Some people got an Orange launch icon that did not work / linked to nothing, while others got a Black one  that worked) or supplied Sony with invalid / wrong licenses... Or Sony themselves just plain screwed up the release.  I'd go with the wrong licenses being issued to unlock the game as a few days after release I got a PSN notification from Sony saying to go into settings and restore licenses to fix the issue.   That and when I check my media through the SEN website there are two version of Dying light there.  (There was a manual fix some user found out to fix it before Sony even took action. If you had the wrong version / license, (Orange Icon) you had to purchase / download a free theme, this would for some reason cause PSN to reissue you with the correct license (Black Icon) allowing you to push the download to your primary PS4)  And on topic of the quality of the game, yeah it's pretty good, repetitive but still fun. Almost quit playing at the start though, 3 times I lost all my gear after sleeping in game and turning my PS4 off.   Why?  Because the game has a glitch that resets gear and levels after sleeping but not progress... The only way around this is to do another activity to force another quick save. There is no way to manually save to avoid this issue either.   It still has not been patched... The game and launch is hardly perfect as OP is claiming.  /Rant   Nice work man, would work well as a custom game case cover, so... if you do an accompanying piece that would work as the back of the case... *knudge knudge, hint hint*  Also, reminds me of the old "X of the living dead" movie posters.    Patton Oswald   Lewis Black  Christopher Titus  John Caparulo  And plenty more either shout their punchline or their entire routine.   Edit:  What are your thoughts on the movie [The Core?](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0298814/)   And full of teeth?    Children of the corn, lend me your ears... And you, the potato folk, your eyes!   The game had a terrible release outside of the US...  Physical release delayed for Europe / Australia and many more locations for an entire month, those who pre ordered the physical version and dont have money to waste to get the PSN digital release need to wait another month.  PSN Store screwed up for those who pre ordered / pre loaded, stopping people from being able to play the game 3 or more days after release... All with little to no acknowledgment from Sony or Techland.  Whether it was Sonys fault or Techlands it doesnt matter, it left a lot of people unhappy and unable to play the game they paid good money for.  For the ones that still need to wait another month will be bored of the game when it comes out after being inundated by all the information, pics, videos, playthroughs over the next month.    I've notice most American comedians yell the punchline if not their entire routine.   Yeah theres a particular species I read about where the female protects the eggs for about 53 months, starving herself the entire time till they finally hatch... Then the hatchlings proceed to eat her dead or alive.  The circle of life I guess.   If it's the Vita-1000 with the OLED screen, then that is normal and is known as the "Mura effect"   Looks like a Smashmouth album cover   Next you'll be telling me that quickly raising a gun doesnt make that clicking sound...   I played this a few times, we called it Wisest Wizard.  We also had the rule that after every 2 cans you either have a shot of something or a bong hit / toke from a joint.    I get invaded 2 - 3 times a night, but can never join a game, everyone disconnects straight away.  Why dont people set their games to private if they dont want to get invaded... It's annoying to all involved setting it to public and quitting / getting kicked every single time.   I left and did another side mission, came back and killed the virals that had spawned and it triggered the next part.    You have 48 Hours.  A few missions later.   You've been out for three days.  Uhhh... ok.jpg   While it looks amazing, it still has the problem of looking too.. clean?   The first part describes [Ace Rimmer](http://i.imgur.com/R5hPrOw.gif)   I'd say it's like I Am Legend, as they started off as mindless grunts killing and eating everyone.. But given enough time they evolved/changed to become the dominant life form and created their own social structure etc.  So yeah, you could be right. Some of the long time turned carry and use weapons, they also have ability to "change" back into Virals.   That and when they "evolve" into other forms they seem to retain some form of self preservation and higher cognitive function.   Yeah I checked with the Quatermaster, all shops / survivor shops.  I've continued playing through most of Old Town without it, but yeah... It'd be nice to have back for online invasions.  Guess I'll have to wait til I finish the game and start a NG+ to get it back haha.   I completed the Rais mission where your gear gets taken and once I got my gear back I had everything sans my UV torch...  I've checked my bag at a safe house, quartermaster and all shops... No one sells them or anything.   I've continued playing as its not really needed for single player,  volitiles are easy to avoid / escape from without it. But I'd like to continue playing online against invading Hunters... and no UV torch = no chance.   Anyone know if there's a fix or a way to get a new one?   I first noticed this with the machete on the desk for the ultimate weapon challenge.   It's a nice touch.    They're only still "there" when freshly turned. After a while they cease to be.   All missions show on the map, even passing comment missions show as an icon on the map.  Check it out when you play next.   Agreed, you already have the scavenger sense dealio that shows where they are... through walls... And is unlimited with no cool down... You don't need them on the map at all times.   Eh, I'm only surival lvl 7, agility 8 and power 6 odd.... And can survive the night easily.  Heck most of the nights I dont even get seen and the times I do I can outrun them easily.  Those who claim its hard or really scary must be as soft as raw cookiedough.  The game is fun but hardly the scariest thing ever.    !: Complete the prologue first  2: ???  3: Profit  Edit: Sorry man, not sure... I only got the Urban outfit DLC and that was unlocked after completing the prologue... Heard there was something about "tickets" that you can redeem for weapons etc, try looking that up.   Complete the prologue first?   It's part of the planned DLC:  - The Bozak Horde: The final Season Pass drop will deliver a new map and gameplay, playable in either single-player or co-op. Go inside the Harran Stadium, the most famous landmark in the city, and test your combat know-how against relentless hordes of the Infected. Fight increasingly stronger and larger enemy waves as you oppose a mysterious psychopath called Bozak.   Damn son, did you only do the main story / no side quests? Did you do no exploring and just ran from point A to point B?  I mean, it's cool if you did... but that sort of defeats the purpose of these sort of games.   Eh, the story/campaign is only part of the game and it does drag on...   The survival mode is where the game shines the most, I stopped playing the story about halfway through and stuck with doing short stints in survival. Was a lot more fun.   Best use was in [Last Action Hero]( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=60NVfBSdOG0)  Also one of the best movies of all time.

You're out of luck till they fix the issue.   They screwed up the licenses, some people are claiming they uploaded the wrong version on the game onto the PSN.

There are two fixes available to get around this though, the first it set the PS4 as your primary then go to the PSN store website on your computer.  First remove Dying light from your pending download list then re-add it. It should then push it to your PS4 to download.  If this doesnt work it's because you've got the "wrong version".  You can see which version you have based on the icon you have in your games list, if Orange... you have the wrong version/license. You need to have the Black hands one.  On your PS4 download / purchase something free, like a theme. After you have done this you will notice the icon for dying light will have changed from the orange one to the black one.  After that repeat step one from the PSN store website.  Basically someone somewhere screwed up and Sony refuse to acknowledge it.

 Hey, isn't Kansas where [two of our biggest welfare queens](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/03/09/1283390/-Koch-Brothers-Takes-88-Million-in-Corporate-Welfare#) hail from?    Yeah, but they continue to be paid because their lying has worked for decades.   But you claim that multiple papers presented at Ringberg "suggest that 2C will be the high" by 2100, which they did not. To the best of my knowledge, *no consensus* at Ringberg or in credible climate science has said any such thing. If anything, the studies presented at the Ringberg Workshop project a likely warming of around 2.5C by 2100, which is both well beyond a "2C upper limit" and probably very conservative given [new data](http://news.sciencemag.org/climate/2015/02/cold-pacific-ocean-offsetting-global-warming) on oceanic warming.   I work with folks who place students in these jobs, and it's not necessarily as sunny as it sounds. "Huge" demand in skilled trades now is often tempered by modest pay, sporadic work and nonunion status that lacks benefits. A master welder makes about what a master secretary does, although bigger money beckons in underwater and overseas work.   Just like baby boomers when *they* were under 30!  (Let the downvotes begin...)    new research was recently presented at Ringberg that clearly demonstrates that making such a prediction at this time is speculative, at best.  Which presentation at Ringberg would that be? If it's any help, [here is a list](http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/en/science/the-atmosphere-in-the-earth-system/ringberg-workshop/ringberg-2014.html).   "Backing off the IPCC's 4.5C prediction?" First, 4.5C is the *high end* of the IPCC's current 1.5 - 4.5 degree temperature forecast for 2100. It's not the median. However, more [recent studies](http://phys.org/news/2015-02-evidence-ipcc-climate-sensitivity.html) suggest warming will be at the upper end of this range in a business-as-usual scenario.   Second, China and India are poor, developing countries heavily invested in hundreds of new coal-fired power plants, their per-capita emissions are still far below ours, and they rightly point out that we westerners are responsible for nearly all of the carbon pollution cooking the climate to date. Still, both ([and especially China](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/02/04/3619026/china-gets-ready-for-national-carbon-market/)) are now making strides to reduce their pollution.   [No.](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2573.html)  2C is one *hell* of a long way beyond natural variance in global climate within a single century, and most experts agree that we have already effectively locked in that amount of increase given that we are unlikely to completely quit burning fossil fuels in around 25 years, which is what it would take to limit warming to 2C.  We are more likely headed for [3-4C](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/31/planet-will-warm-4c-2100-climate) warming by 2100.  http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/04/climate-sensitivity-is-unlikely-to-be-less-than-2c-say-scientists/                  "Renewables like wind and solar and biomass will certainly play roles in a future energy economy, but those energy sources cannot scale up fast enough to deliver cheap and reliable power at the scale the global economy requires. While it may be theoretically possible to stabilize the climate without nuclear power, in the real world there is no credible path to climate stabilization that does not include a substantial role for nuclear power."  Sincerely,  Dr. Ken Caldeira, Senior Scientist, Department of Global Ecology, Carnegie Institution  Dr. Kerry Emanuel, Atmospheric Scientist, Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Dr. James Hansen, Climate Scientist, Columbia University Earth Institute  Dr. Tom Wigley, Climate Scientist, University of Adelaide and the National Center for Atmospheric Research  http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists-letter/   The line can be blurry. Fascism is always totalitarian, always very nationalistic and often insular. Socialism *can* be those things, as it was under Stalin and Mao, but it can also be democratic, culturally open, and blended with capitalism, as in the Nordic countries.   Fascism rose as a reaction against socialism, led by nationalists like Hitler who hated the internationalism and pacifism of socialists, who many Germans blamed for  losing the First World War. Most fascist governments since have been similarly violent, nationalistic, anti-communist, and run by charismatic strong men.    we would see massive investments in solar by private industries to save money and become more efficient. They aren't doing that without subsidies.  [In many regions of many countries solar is now grid-competitive without subsidies](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3043473/in-much-of-the-world-solar-power-is-already-as-cheap-as-grid-electricity).The United States now has a [a few of those regions as well](http://www.hawaiireporter.com/big-rooftop-solar-panels-make-sense-in-hawaii-without-any-subsidies). Many more are on the way.  That's looking at world wide oil and gas and doesn't take into account the enormous difference in market size between oil and renewable. On a per capita basis renewable receive far more money in subsidies than oil and gas  Fossil fuels are the world's second-most-subsidized industry, after arms, and they are *vastly* more subsidized than renewables.    There isn't one yet. The world's governments are in preliminary negotiations leading up this summer's the big UN climate conference in Paris.    It wasn't enough that McConnell's Congressional Republicans openly tried to undermine the President's nuclear arms diplomacy with Iran? Now they're subverting his negotiations with the world on climate solutions?  Where's a firing squad when you need one?    "Solar isn't financially viable - except with massive government subsidies and grants.  First, solar is very economically viable without subsidies in some places right now, and its cost is dropping by half every five years, so it will soon be economically viable nearly everywhere.  Second, solar subsidies are dwarfed by the [$550 billion in annual direct subsidies to the oil, gas and coal industries](http://image.slidesharecdn.com/d2-am-s7-subsidies-petarvujanovic-ocde-141205102749-conversion-gate02/95/fossilfuel-subsidy-reforem-by-petar-vujanovic-2-638.jpg?cb=1417796944)--and that's without considering the trillions in annual *indirect* subsidies for fossil fuels, for things like military actions and automotive infrastructure. And these are subsidies for a mature, incredibly wealthy industry that needs no help with new infrastructure or development, and, let's not forget, this is an industry that every national scientific academy has identified as a major threat to global wellbeing, while solar presents one of our best opportunities to reduce that threat.   "Have you got a source for that figure?"  http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704852004575258541875590852          "Dont fight automation; focus on the political challenge of making sure its fruits are shared equitably."  Yes, there's the rub.   80% of the world's oil is in the hands of national oilcos, which are largely unmentioned here. Peak oil isn't a concern, as the recent glut shows clearly enough. (Climate, however, is a true game changer, but the author doesn't mention that either.)      Dodgy.   The last cycle measured was 2012, when Dems won.    Young people forty years ago didn't vote any more than they do now. Boomers didn't really begin voting in large numbers until the 1990s, and they've only recently begun to hit the late-life stage when people tend to vote without fail (which usually begins around age 65).  As for your feeling that the baby boom was defined by Woodstock and so on, with all due respect that view was manufactured for you by pundits looking for something to talk about at the time and afterwards. Don't get me wrong: the early boomers' coming of age in the late 1960s was big, but mostly because the generation followed the 1930-1945 baby *bust*. However, in economic terms relevant to this article, the boomers had their biggest impact much later than most think.  Truth is, the larger, younger end of the baby boom has much more in common with GenX: they all hit adulthood after the early boomers had taken many of the jobs and bid up the price of houses; all were part of the cohort that first lost employer pensions and lifetime job security.     All correct, except that Portland's water comes mostly from snowmelt at those higher elevations. The climate is bone-dry most of the summer, when water demand is highest.   He's not saying screw driverless cars or anything. In fact he welcomes them.  Yeah, he basically says that insurance companies would be among the only losers, due to fewer accidents, which is obvious enough. We already know that Detroit hates self-driving cars for similar reasons.  For me, the most interesting bit in this is when Buffett hedges and wonders about 10% penetration by 2030. If that's a conservative figure, it says much.    [Here](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=E01) is the breakout: 90% of oil and gas campaign money went to Repubs in the last election cycle measured.    80% of oil money goes to Republicans and their causes.  That was then. [It's now 90%.](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=E01)   Now let's just see if Republicans in Congress can resist the urge to write yet another undermining letter to Iranian leaders.      Agreed, although I suspect the freeway median may have been used here partly to prevent the theft of solar panels.   This issue recurs from time to time, and it's always the same ploy: transfer the National Forests and other Federal lands to the states, where easily-bought politicians will then sell off everything to private logging, mining and real estate companies--who will then fence out the public.   It's up to us to block these bastards. Every time this comes up, write your reps and say, "no way!".   I'm reasonably certain that more than one whip-wielding southern slaveholder also told his slaves, "at least you aren't living in Africa!".      We agree that most are only too happy to continue their lazy inattention, maybe while patting themselves on the back for switching to low-energy lightbulbs. However, I doubt that many have yet bought into the oil industry's latest craven pitch to abandon all hope.          Those are results of introducing intermittency into the system.  On the contrary. The smart grid is coming for a hundred reasons that have nothing to do with intermittency. Smart meters and smart buildings top the list, and those primarily concern cost control and efficiency, as outlined in [this ComEd overview](https://www.comed.com/technology/smart-meter-smart-grid/Pages/smart-grid.aspx) which lists everything *but* intermittency.   The poorest countries don't have nukes  Pakistan *is* one of the poorest countries, and nuclear-armed. North Korea as well. Russia isn't exactly rich. Others will follow.   I find that (warfare) scenario highly, highly improbable.  You must know better than US military leaders, then. Sleep well.     Okay, Chris Mooney; *you* may not have been talking about this but plenty others have. Bad headline on an otherwise good article.  You're one of the best journalists writing about the disconnect between science and political preconceptions, but this is different: you're delving into the details of climate science, and this is clearly new territory for you. Step carefully.   The few people I know who say "it's too late; it's now hopeless" are people who never cared about climate to begin with. For them, this is merely the latest convenient excuse for continued lazy inattention.   I am aware of no single study that doesn't acknowledge the costs of integrating intermittency into the grid. If there were one, I bet you would have cited it.  http://cleantechnica.com/2014/01/24/forget-intermittency-nrel-says-wind-energy-can-boost-grid-reliability/  A smart grid exists for the sole purpose of dealing with intermittency.  No, the smart grid is needed for many reasons: resilience, smart metering, peak pricing, operational savings, etc..   I know it's popular to dream of a day when every home is it's energy castle, but it just isn't backed up by economic realities.  Who said grid power will vanish? Not me.  The purpose of warfare when caused by economic depression is to seize what others have. How can you do that if you nuke their shit?  Clausewitz disagrees with your definition of war's purpose, but history shows us that *any* rational "purpose" for war is usually quickly lost in gore, hatred, and the burned bodies of innocents piled to the skies.  To date the primary purpose of nuclear weapons has been defensive: "invade my country and we'll nuke you". However, conflicts and associated chaos will continue to escalate in the world's poorest, most climate-vulnerable regions as climate damage rises, both increasing temptations to incinerate enemies while also inevitably putting nuclear arsenals in the hands of victorious insurgents. ISIS, for example, sprang from the chaos of the long Syrian drought, gathered momentum by adding the excluded Sunnis of Iraq and now Yemen. They would dearly love to someday seize Pakistan and its nuclear missiles, and studies suggest that global warming is [adding to that very threat](http://www.dawn.com/news/1157200). And that's merely one of [many climate concerns](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2014/11/14/does-our-military-know-something-we-dont-about-global-warming/) that now worry US military leaders.  Let's just say that more desperation, drought, cultural friction and economic despair don't make a nuclear-armed world any safer.     The more renewables grow, the costlier their impact to the grid.  Debatable, and most of these complaints are coming from old-line utilities trying to preserve their sweet monopolies.  With or without renewables, we'll need a smarter grid, so it's unfair to blame all of its costs on the rise of renewables.    Batteries are far too expensive for developing countries.   [Not for long.](http://dqbasmyouzti2.cloudfront.net/assets/content/cache/made/content/images/articles/Storage_Cost_Drops_530_402_s.png)   Yes, because nuking people solves economic problems. /s  You're probably right. When has economic depression ever led to world war?    Speaking of cherry picking, you're basing your complaint entirely on the wind graph, where newer Greenpeace forecasts contrast with older forecasts from other sources. But what about the other two graphs that show more contemporary forecasts from multiple sources? In those, the Greenpeace forecasts still outperform by wide margins.  Again, the point isn't that Greenpeace is perfect, but that most researchers, even theirs, have underestimated the growth of renewables. As in this excerpt:  *"The results for solar PV are even more dramatic...In this case, though, actual statistics proved higher, nearly doubling the optimistic Greenpeace formulation."*      Boomers alone didn't fuck you. Hell, Americans are still basically fighting the Civil War, with political loyalties persistently aligned by North-South geography and opinions on white, Christian supremacy.  Until recently, boomers didn't vote much either. The country has long been run by the very old, because only the very old vote without fail, in absolutely every little election. When it gets down to voting on fire commissioners and school bonds, the ancient are *three times* more likely to cast a ballot than 20-somethings are.    No need to tackle reams of peer-reviewed papers. Just read some of the many credible online digests of climate science. [Skepticalscience.com](http://www.skepticalscience.com) should be at the top of the list. Other good sources include [NASA](http://climate.nasa.gov), realclimate.org and climatecentral.com.                     There's no doubt that renewables are critical, and, taken together, they may be the single most important future power source, but they simply will not be enough, which is why several of the world's leading climate scientists recently issued [this joint letter](http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists-letter/) to world leaders.  The need to leave carbon fuels has now become an emergency. We need all hands on deck, and all the carbon-free power that we can muster...like, yesterday.   More common: skilled, experienced older workers thrown out of work are reluctant to take a big step backwards, and often for good reason. If your income plunges in your 50s, you may well lose your spouse, your house, your health insurance. Your kids may lose their college opportunities. Prospects for any kind of retirement can vanish.   The baby boom's peak birth year was 1957, meaning the heart of the baby boom is now 57-58; they were 10-11 when Woodstock happened, and they didn't really begin voting at all consistently until the Clinton years. (Reagan was elected by their parents.)   I don't think the article's point was to praise Greenpeace, but to show how growth in renewable power blew past all forecasts, *even* Greenpeace's.   The truth is, boomers didn't control much at all until 23 years ago, when Clinton was elected. Like every other generation, they didn't really begin voting faithfully until well into middle age, and the peak of the baby boom is now only 58.   Simply put, this article is a steaming heap of lies spread for years by oil industry flunkies. No matter how often they're debunked, they just keep springing back like a case of herpes.   There was no 1970s global scientific consensus that the climate is cooling. There was no UN forecast of "50 million climate refugees by 2010". And so on.   Do some real scientific reading, or, if you can't, at least accept the facts that all 97 of the world's national scientific academies, and 97% of publishing climatologists, are in complete agreement that we are responsible for warming the globe.   And also be aware that the largest industry in human history is doing everything in its power to confuse you about that.         The TPP hasn't passed, most of its signatories would likely be part of any global climate agreement as well, and, frankly, getting sued by Peru is not at the top of American worries.   Ashton would be the wrong guy to ask about the economic details of decarbonization. He simply takes Shell to task for their refusal to acknowledge the need to do it at all, and good for him.  However, few in the know believe this will be accomplished with renewables alone. Nuclear will be part of the solution as well. Yet renewables will carry most of the weight, in both developed and developing nations. Solar/battery combos and microgrids, in particular, are well suited to developing countries precisely because they don't require existing transmission infrastructure.   As for cost, two points: 1) The cost of decarbonizing is now low--about [1-3%](http://unsdsn.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/US-Deep-Decarbonization-Report.pdf) of global GDP--but will [quickly rise](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-11/power-decarbonization-cost-rises-22-to-44-trillion-iea-says) if we continue stalling; 2) the cost of *not* decarbonizing the economy is [potentially ruinous](http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10414.pdf) (figures like 20% of GDP are often mentioned), and that's before we consider that economic collapse on that order would almost certainly ignite nuclear war.  The only possible conclusion is that we have no choice but to leave most of the world's fossil fuel reserves unburned. The good news is that we can easily afford to do it. The bad news: we cannot afford to wait.                           You're right, everyone wants "a throat to choke" when they suffer a loss. However, if that hypothetical kid who ran into the street was killed by *you* behind the wheel, rather than by a computer, there is little chance that you would be held liable unless someone could prove that you had been driving recklessly. Why hold the computer to a higher standard?   Thing is, these cars will crash less than human-driven cars will, creating a net benefit for insurers. The hard part is assigning liability, I agree, but should the company have to pay extra for a net benefit it delivers to third parties?            Yeah, but Canada isn't forecast to be one of the countries most parched by heat and drought in coming decades.   True, but the Dems are still trying to govern. Repubs are simply sowing division, discord and mistrust in order to wreck the consensus needed for government.    Although this piece is clearly unpopular with techies on Reddit, thanks for posting it. Sure, many nations excel at mathematics and technical competency, but only the United States wows the world with companies that capture the imagination like Disney, Apple and Nike.      Yeah, lacking brains and a heart is hell on creativity.   This is worse than anarchy. This is pitchforks and torches as far as the eye can see.    Companies often drink their own Kool-Aid like this, rationalizing away their lapses and convincing themselves that they are actually engaged in something good and even *vital*, then being surprised when the public doesn't buy it.  After the public relations disaster that is *Blackfish*, Sea World's only real recourse is to phase out  orcas as amusement attractions. That is what they must now do, but not before earning yet another black eye in the process.         Agreed. However, if it walks like a sociopath and it talks like a sociopath...                        Who made you?         Commuted for years with a backpack myself because I didn't want a rack and pannier on my nice road bike, but always regretted it.    Sure it's depressing, but some people *are* intentionally evil, willing to actively lie to get what they want. They're called sociopaths, and they make up [2-4% of the population](http://www.amazon.com/Sociopath-Next-Door-Martha-Stout/dp/0767915828). They are defined by a strong personal sense of superiority, a reckless disregard for "little people's rules", a ruthless willingness to screw anyone for personal gain, and a psychotic confidence that they'll be able to lie their way out of any jam. Sound familiar?   Suggestion: rather than strapping a bag to the rack, get a pannier bag to hang off the rack. Much more secure.   Second-best: get a small backpack.    Cruz strikes me as an opportunistic ideologue from oil country (Calgary) who followed the industry's money to Texas, which has a long history of backing oily pols for the Presidency. The fact that he graduated Harvard Law doesn't mean squat about his objectivity or ethics.   Still more bad news for beef.   We have a fossil fuels industry problem on climate change. That industry merely gives 90% of its campaign money to Repubs.   It's more that the main reservoir lies 3,100' above the city.   More to the point, we have a campaign finance and political media problem on climate change. When the largest industry in the history of mankind gives 90% of its political donations to Republicans, and the when party leaders depend on support from television and radio networks run by men with close oil industry ties, we shouldn't be surprised that loudmouthed lunatics from Texas are willing to sing their song.    But Senator Inhofe has a snowball.         Not a real climatologist, but SoCal isn't going away. 80% of California water usage is in agriculture, so farms will feel it first. LA basin residents will just face stretches without lawn watering or car washing.       Not in the Republican Party.   What do you expect from a media corporation run by men with deep [oil and coal industry ties](http://www.wnd.com/2013/01/is-saudi-prince-steering-news-corp-coverage/) who specialize in pandering to the most proudly carbon-polluting consumers in the US, Canada and Australia?   Why is this a problem? If we are serious about solving the climate mess, we need every carbon-free energy source we can get our hands on.   CCS looks more like nothing but a political talking point to salve swing states. Unfortunately, most big political swing states states happen to be coal states (Kentucky, West Virginia, Colorado, etc.) so CCS is offered to win their support for climate action. Attempts to make it actually work affordably, as with NextGen, however, have mostly failed. The only places where it shows even limited promise are places where coal-fired power plants sit atop deep oil fields with secure capstone, like Texas, in which power plant exhaust can be injected to squeeze out oil.    And meals, beer, cable, etc.   Bingo. Strelkov's men were very likely the bastards who shot down the Malay airliner. Against that kind of world-class asshole, even Putin look like a softy.   Can't say for sure, but I suspect that some of these fraternities began partly as secret societies of military cadets and other future Confederate officers who were networking for the war to come.   It's not surprising that they picked this up at a national conference. Those tend to mix young house leaders with older, retrograde racists who run the alumni wings of many old-line fraternities and sororities that originated in the antebellum South, [as SAE did](http://www.sae.net/page.aspx?pid=756).   Pretty much. A telling example is the current DirectTV spot featuring Rob Lowe saying "don't be like the other me...the 'peaked in high school' Rob Lowe" (who wears a letterman's jacket while serving fast food).         This could be a preview of coming attractions for other hydro-dependent regions in the world's warmer temperate zones as [Hadley Cell](http://www.goes-r.gov/users/comet/tropical/textbook_2nd_edition/media/graphics/ch3_overview_image.jpg) expansion dries them out. Look out Brazil, China, India.   "While there have been a few attempts to found liberal alternatives to ALEC, none have yet caught on."  This made me laugh. ALEC exists because it's backers want to wreck government so they can rule like feudal princes. How many corporations and billionaires are interested in backing a group that stands for *more* business regulation and wealth redistribution?   Bribery cannot be solved by more bribery.   A quaint reminder of those dewy halcyon days before e-commerce and big data were worth trillions, before the Net became the province of spies, gangsters and terrorists.   Anyone else find it funny that the largest company profiting from our fall from grace is called Apple?   In the interest of efficiency, you'll all stop this social interaction, networking, courting, coaching and mentoring shit immediately.    Take off in a recursive explosion of intelligence and boogie with the universal intelligences in this and other universes.               In American high schools (grades 9-12), private companies sell [expensive jackets](http://www.vsacustom.com/images/varsityjacket_Blue.gif) for top-level athletes to display their athletic awards. If you make the top-level ("varsity") boy's basketball team, for example, you become a "letterman" who "lettered" in basketball, and you are entitled to buy and wear the letterman's jacket with the letter sewn on it.    Yep, an armed society is a polite society.   To be fair, the US had an underclass long before it had auto-centric suburbs. I'd argue that suburbanization (and GM's trolley destruction) merely put more distance between the *urban* underclass and other Americans, but remember that most American poverty [is rural](http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/rural-poverty-well-being/geography-of-poverty.aspx).    The smartest very definitely do *not* "always rise to the top".   This is a deeper, darker level than mere passport theft and indentured servitude. This is true slavery: buying people at market, locking them in cages at gunpoint, barely feeding them, forcing unpaid work in factories and fishing ships for life.   Call John Brown.         Cities are frequently on the hook for supplying utilities at low or no charge to new suburban developments beyond the city lines.   It's a vicious cycle that pits city and county governments against one another like this:   1) County government wants more tax base so approves new suburban development, free riding on burdens to city for water/sewer, connecting roads, etc..  2) City makes up for loss by annexing older commercial districts just beyond city lines, which costs county some of its tax base. So...  3) County government greenlights more development on suburban fringe to recoup tax base lost to city.        It's the closest thing to a basic income program that exists in the US.  It's also something of a preview of the fee-and-dividend carbon tax that's likely coming on the national scale.   From the article:  "Bear in mind that a family of four collects four same sized dividends."  Alaska families collect a dividend for everyone in the household.   A friend of mine comes from a low-income family of twelve. You do the math.   "The researchers found ten different frames used to communicate climate change: Settled Science, Political or Ideological Struggle, Role of Science, Uncertain Science, Disaster, Security, Morality and Ethics, Opportunity, Economics and Health. The first five frames were used to communicate the IPCC reports much more frequently -- whereas the latter frames were not used much at all."  In other words, the media tend to report on climate in the ways that are most contentious but least connected to our daily lives.   About time. Until the 1980s, and with additional damage from a 1978 Supreme Court ruling, we had usury laws that made these practices illegal. And with good reason: usury makes the middle class poor, and it makes the poor debt slaves, tearing apart society. That's why the Bible ranks it as a capital crime in the same league with murder and rape.  [Here](https://americansforfairnessinlending.wordpress.com/the-history-of-usury/) is a reasonably good synopsis.      We can be reasonably sure that any such game-changing, work-reducing new technology would benefit mostly the few engineers who corner the technology, and push the rest of us just that much closer to minimum wage.   First of all, your friend has poor taste in other friends, so you might look for better friends yourself.   As for the link, it's all a pile of crap, but let's just address that first graph as an example:   It cherry-picks a misleading time span, 1995-2010, which is one of the few in which *surface temps* (more on that below) were flat. To either side of this little window you'd see a rising temp trend.   It ignores ocean temps. 93.4% of the excess heat from greenhouse warming goes into the oceans, and the oceans have continued warming unabated.   We now know that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and other long-cycle oceanic convection currents create multi-decadal cycles of heat capture and release to the atmosphere, so that warming will proceed in stair-step fashion. Right now we are in a PDO "cool phase" due to end in a few years, when atmospheric heating will again take off steeply as it did in the 1990s.    The HADCRUT dataset used here is not "air temperature anomaly" (The UK Met Office does not use that term) but "surface temperature anomaly". Because surface temps over the Pacific are not anomalously warm during a cool PDO phase, they make it seem as if global temps have gone flat. However, look what has happened over a [longer span](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/crutem4/), and, in particular, the steep warming in northern continental areas.  I could go on. Your "friend's friend" is putting his/her faith in an obscure conspiracy site created by a conservative lunatic, while ignoring the united opinion of every national scientific academy on Earth, after the largest scientific inquiry of all time? Again, avoid this asshole.            I sure didn't see it. Sold Kraft six months ago.   DARVO, actually. Much nastier than mere projection.   I notice that some [long-range global drought forecast maps](http://www2.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/news/2010/2090-2099wOceanLabels.jpg) show especially dry future conditions in the Mediterranean Basin and the Mexico/Caribbean/Venezuelan region. What is the confidence interval for these projections? They are pretty scary.    The link            Also a low regulatory bar for building codes, and the ability to cut deals with weak suburban municipalities for low property taxes.      This could kill someone. Holy shit.   He actually strikes me as more of a Jefferson Davis guy.   Usury. A term that's fallen out of use. Time to revive it.   give hospitals an incentive to compete on prices, and hopefully lower the cost of health care.  Unless you're shopping for a specific high-ticket procedure like a hip replacement, you'll probably find medical pricing too impossibly complex for comparisons. This just invites hospitals to engage in loss-leader pricing, gouging on everything else, and it encourages inefficiently duplicating costly facilities between hospitals because no hospital wants to miss a chance at rare but lucrative treatments.  The only thing that has demonstrably lowered care costs by wide margins is just the opposite: government control and near-universal risk pooling.   A likely candidate: desal powered by solar PV, which will be both crazy-cheap by then and well suited to the dry, sunny coasts where urban water shortages will be most acute.     I'm reasonably sure that Warren Buffett waited for me to sell my stock in Kraft before he pounced and drove up the price 35% today.   Well played, Warren. Well played.   Should we be surprised that the longstanding outliers in satellite data analysis consistently originate with an evolution-denying Christian fundamentalist who serves on the boards of several oil-funded climate-science-denial organizations?  http://www.southernstudies.org/2011/09/climate-science-contrarian-roy-spencers-oil-industry-ties.html      You got that right. However, American utilities aren't exactly known to embrace change, they are legal monopolies, and they are politically powerful at the state/local level, so their first reaction is to block competition.   If they were smarter, they'd avoid the fate of German utilities like RWE and E.on, which tumbled in value for years before finally selling off their worst coal plants to embrace renewables and DG.   Marketing creative slots have vanished in recent decades due to automation in a dozen ways.  Consider the ad agency art director, so called because that person once directed dozens of artisans: pasteup artists, typographers, photographers, film makers, illustrators, strippers, engravers, printers, etc.. Now the "art director" handles all those roles alone, using Abobe CS on a Mac, usually using stock images rather than producing original art. Goodbye to most of those other creative jobs.  The rise of retail is another example, replacing the need for much advertising and PR. The key to *that* was the development of retail databases and scanners. Hello to more minimum-wage Walmart stockers; goodbye to highly paid ad agency copywriters and account execs.  Then consider the consolidation of major consumer companies, which used to be widely distributed but are now heavily concentrated thanks to IT systems that allow fast real-time management of complex networks. That means that the marketing work once done by dozens of local ad agencies and marketing departments across the country is now handled by a handful of people in New York and Chicago.  So, yes, marketing creativity is still in demand, but it takes a lot fewer people to provide it.   Except owners of capital. They'll *always* be safe.      Opposition to distributed generation is coming mostly from the electric utility industry, but I take your point.   [This](http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?type=C cid=N00033085 newMem=N cycle=2014) explains much.      Bingo. CCS remains a pipe dream except in rare cases where suitable, deep, secure underground storage already exists.   Without global Keynesian stimulus spending after 2008, the world would have likely collapsed into a depression as bad or worse as the 1930s. Nations that invested in more stimulus, such as the U.S. and China, have generally fared better than places that invested less, like Europe.   True, but production forestry is not problematic; clearing forest for pastures is. A cap and trade system compensates landowners for keeping the land in forest, while a carbon tax does not.   What if the collapse of the American Dream is bigger than the baby boom, or bigger than America itself? This is a trend throughout the rich world, and it has been under way for some time. Blaming 1/4 of Americans for not singlehandedly stopping it is pretty harsh. Plenty of boomers are getting screwed as well.   Both, actually. We do still have time to prevent warming of 3C or above, and it'd take lots more than dikes to deal with the consequences of *that*.   There's a difference between wahoo and whoopee.   "So why not build renewable, instead?"  Because, despite all of its benefits, we cannot build enough renewable power to get the world off of carbon fuels in time.   Did baby boomers usher in Social Security or Medicare? Did they keep polluting and raping landscapes as previous American generations did? Did they leave Jim Crow racism to fester for a century as their elders did? News to me.  Sure, boomers leave a lot to be desired. So did their parents. And their grandparents. And so will your generation.   That's the way it should be. Every generation should improve on the previous. But, God help me, there's always a slice of each generation coming of age that thinks their parents' cohort is responsible for all the world's ills. Unless you are 60-something and German, your resentment is misplaced.   I don't know you, but it sure sounds as if you worked your ass off more to build security you never had, and less to provide for a family that may come later.  Now that you have a little cushion, why not take those skills and that resume' to a job you'll enjoy more? It will vastly improve your chances of finding a great spouse and starting that family you want.   Not so opposite. When he said that, Keynes was countering economists who maintained that capitalism needs no interference because "imbalances work out in the long run". Instead, Keynes favored taking action to improve the future, much like planting a tree.   California will do just fine. There'll be fewer irrigated farms, but the cities will thrive, and they're built for quakes.      Note: these complaints aren't from Cubans, but from rich-world *tourists* whining about the impending commercialization of "dear, quaint Cuba". Reminds me of the very elderly rich reminiscing about the charm of old Hawaii when it was poor.   We richies may have farther to fall in a total collapse, but a total collapse is unlikely. And, in any economic crisis, the rich always do better than the poor. What concerns me most is the possibility of incremental decline in global prosperity and security leading to police states in rich countries, most likely with heavily nationalistic, fascist overtones. Many would welcome that, seeing it as protection from the brown barbarians killing one another in the real shit-holes farther south.    Yes, which is a primary reason why we'll probably have cap-and-trade systems as well as carbon taxes. For all their merits (and their popularity with economists) carbon taxes don't directly reward those who preserve vital carbon sinks such as forests.    Sure, the world is well past its agrarian-era carrying capacity, so we are *all* technologically and economically interdependent now. However, over the next generation or so, the greatest threats to rich-world citizens are likely to be from chaos in poor, subtropical countries hit by drought and food supply interruptions. Syria and the Arab Spring uprisings are just a taste. ISIS is as much a product of climate change as of the American destruction of Iraq.  TL;DR- Spreading, climate-caused violence and economic strife abroad is probably a greater threat to Americans than is climate-related collapse of domestic systems.         Generally speaking, citizens of rich countries are at far lower risk than those of poor countries; citizens of temperate and near-polar countries are at lower risk than those nearer the equator; citizens of militarily strong countries are at lower risk than those of weak ones. As the world's richest, strongest country, largest food producer and owner of rich temperate and northern lands, the US will do much better than most.   [The referenced Nature article.](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2570.html)      A bit of both. The US still has a few further opportunities for large-scale hydro, and quite a number at small-scale, but damming many of those places (Yosemite, Canyonlands, Copper River, etc.) has been prevented by well justified environmental concerns.   And state officeholders, county council members, school board members and so on. If there is one thing the old/white/passionate conservative base does well, it's to vote in *every* election, no matter how tiny. That ensures they always have a deep bench of junior pols ready to move up, and it preserves the heavy state and federal advantages given to rural voters which allow conservatives to punch well above their weight.   http://blogs.denverpost.com/thebalancesheet/2015/03/23/renewable-energy-isnt-boosting-electric-bills-study-contends/12570/  	200

 It's just because they're all in sync with the smooth bass line that is inevitably playing in the background.   It's really great seeing all the athletes from around the world come together.  It's also great to be chatting with all you lovely people here :)    Haha same here!   At least the time difference in Rio is pretty close to the U.S. for the 2016 Games. Hopefully they won't be able to screw it up nearly as much.   Canmerica FTW!   That's awesome, thanks for posting!   Didn't vote for him, but he makes a lot of good points.   Woo Wisconsin!   Shame about White. But he gave it his best and was a gentleman in defeat, which is all you can ask for.   I love the guy in red in the second picture, like "Hey man, look at what this girl is doing!"    That's cool. I've always enjoyed watching some of the Paralympic downhill events, but have only ever seen them on Youtube.    Flavin!!   Haha, I know what you mean. I was watching a special on Olympians working out and the lengths they go to for training...while I was sitting there crushing a Chipotle burrito and cookies.  I felt the need to go do some sit-ups at least...    Haha, that's perfect!   Some are also U.S. citizens but have familial origins in other countries that they compete for. Like Julia Marino, Paraguay's only athlete in these Olympics, was born in Paraguay but was adopted by an American family when she was just a few months old.    100% agree   Flat knitting, circular knitting, felting, crochet...they might need to build their own venue to contain it.    Good game, kudos to both teams.      Congrats to the Dutch! That was some real athleticism out there.    That's awesome, congrats!      Seriously. The record for playing through the main quest in Skyrim is under an hour, but anyone who's played it knows that the sidequests are what make it way longer.   Haha, amazing what  few months can do!   As a frequent driver from St. Cloud to the Cities, tell your dad thanks!   Woo St.cloud/cities!   I never really liked Pascal's wager. Belief isn't like an on/off switch; you can't just make yourself believe something because you want the potential rewards if it turns out to be true.  As far as living forever, it's going to end eventually at some point with the heat death/big crunch of the universe. I have no idea if there is a God, but I figure it's best to just be nice to everyone and live as long as possible with technology.    This is great. I'm young but I can already feel my knees starting to go (my grandpa, dad, and older brother have all had knee surgery). This, along with recent stories around stem cell injections being shown to regrow cartilage in the knee gives me hope that I can avoid surgery and use stem cells to regrow what my body needs.    wow, nice!   PB J for lunch. Every day since Kindergarten to now in my 20s.    There was also a story the Russians built a nuke in their embassy in Washington DC. Since diplomatic packages aren't allowed to be searched by customs, the Russians had it brought in piece by piece and had an expert assemble it in the embassy. That way, if things went to hell, they could detonate a nuke right in the middle of DC with zero warning time or chance of being intercepted.  http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001206,00.html    Doesn't Gorilla Glass already do this?  http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/10/tech/gaming-gadgets/gorilla-glass-ces/   Thank God this exists   I like that European countries got together to make the EU. Yes it has problems and, who knows, maybe it will get worse. But that fact that the people got together and said "It's the 21st century, let's stop messing around with different currencies, trade barriers, etc. and just work together is amazing. It really gives me hope for the future."  Also the people are nice!   I love how it's called "Project Cybersyn".   It's like they sat around and tried to come up with the most evil sounding name they could.   What do you think has been the greatest advancement in chemistry in the last 10 years? What do think will be the most important advancement in the next 10 years?      God that movie was actually pretty terrifying as a kid. Like that scene where Judge Doom kills the shoe in the Dip?

If I was stuck on a submarine for 2 months, having an Oculus Rift would be amazing...   Country roads, take me home...   OMG I still have this on a floppy disk. Sadly nothing I have can still play it...   As I understand it, we don't have the heavy lift Saturn V rockets we used for Apollo anymore, as there hasn't been a need for them. So to go back to the moon, we would need to have a new "super-heavy lift" rocket. The [Falcon 9 Heavy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy) might be able to, however.    Good detective work   This is bad...   That's a really nice letter, thanks for posting.   Persona has always been about the Social Links, so really just having those be more developed. Rather than just scrambling to max out SL's with everyone, I like to see some real depth and relationship development in a few.    Well said.   Jesus Christ...   "I thought this was America! I'm sorry, I thought this was America!"         Wow that's great looking!   Haha my first thought too   Adorable!   And Minnesota too!   And it's free on Xbox Live Gold through the 15th! Highly recommended.   Totally agree. It's crazy to think what we waste money on when it could be spent on this. Life extension would obviously benefit everyone, so why is it so ignored?   Thank you for that. Very well said.    Put a 45 on your dick before you go at it. You'll build stamina in no time!   This would be awesome to use as an interceptor just to mess with people. Imagine some Russians buzzing our coast and having a completely empty plane pull up alongside...   Congrats!   I like Tifa's smile. Very spunky.    Haha I saw that and thought the same thing!   OMG my wife and I just got to season 11 last night and now a ton of the episodes are gone!   Best of luck to them.    Agent J?  	68
    I know right?!  I'll keep my future kids away from the Ram Van. Back in my days we used to download RAM for FREE!   The candyman is safe. Kids these days need to stay away from the Ram Van.

I just wish I could kinda put a skin on that:(   So 7 hours ago FL12 was released. I, like probably everyone else here, immediately downloaded and installed it. Unlike the most of you I did not try the beta though, for I was waiting for a stable version. Only after I had installed FL it loaded with a flat yet childish UI that I personally do not favor over FL11's. The font is a impact roundish font that is rather large at times and does not blend with the interface. FL12 looks like a toy to me. I prefer FL11's professional looks. KUDOS TO ImageLine for adding touchpad usability. Now I can work on the go. Rarely do, but thanks.    Thanks. Just got them new. Usually never wore my old ones.   So as a 16 year old teen with rather large ears and glasses my helix tore. I LISTENED TO MUSIC SO LONG THAT MY HELIX TORE!

 Ah thanks for the input! I'm just a confused first year wondering whether to continue my degree or just switch out completely to something far more general like CS or Civil.   Just to add, my Geomatics Course requires a range of courses from programming in SQL/C/Matlab, remote sensing, GIS, Linear Algebra+Calc, etc. (It's also credited by a couple surveying and engineering organisations)   Will surveying degrees have this too?               Do NOT attempt to take beta blockers for the first time if you aren't used to them!             Please show us a sample D:      If anything, I think companies will usually value diversity over speciality so long as you have the necessary skillset.Just my 2c, one employer I talked to once told me that when he goes through job applications, it is the masters/phd degree that makes you who you are.      *in a very soft voice*  g-g-geomatics? b-b-because... m-maps... can be u-useful for e-evil stuff too...  *goes back into hiding*   Just to give an overview of what courses we have to take:   Using SQL to program (also learnt C, C++, Java and Python), SDI, GIS, GNSS, Geodesy, Standard math (calc+lin. algebra), land administration, ER Modelling, relational algebra, remote sensing and some geology courses like applications of geophysics, tectonics   geodynamics, field mapping and sedimentary geology.   Are GIS careers really my only option?   To open more doors, I have the option of switching to structural, civil or environmental, should I do it or stick with what I have?   I'm really open to all advice so thanks in advance! :)    That attributes to the nature of the invisible hand not the accumulation of wealth.      So this is the quote: "An "invisible hand" directed individuals and firms to work toward the nation's good as an unintended consequence of efforts to maximise their own gain. This provided a moral justification for the accumulation of wealth, which had previously been viewed by some as sinful"  I don't understand how this accumulation of wealth can be positive and a good thing. Someone help?   Are you alright?  "yes!"  No! You're all, all left!!11!!1!1.1!        Surveying is something that interests me but it would be nice if there were other options as well.   Sometimes I feel as though my engineering field isn't "real" engineering compared to ME,EE,CE,BME, etc. I really really love stuff that involves GIS,GPS,GNSS,Geodesy, etc. Was really inspired after using Google Earth for the first time and used to handmake crude maps of my countryside and local forests when I was younger so I decided to go into Geomatics. However... while employment isn't a real problem, i'm considering changing to Civil or Environmental just for added breadth as that's what my peers tell me I should do...   Just to give an overview of what courses we have to take:  Using SQL to program (also learnt C, C++, Java and Python), SDI, GIS, GNSS, Geodesy, Standard math (calc+lin. algebra), land administration, ER Modelling, relational algebra, remote sensing and some geology courses like applications of geophysics, tectonics   geodynamics, field mapping and sedimentary geology.

I'm really open to all advice so thanks in advance! :)     	25
 It seems like every scene is actually set in late 1700's Vienna. The streets, the opera house, the royal palace, the costumes, the symphonies, and even what I would imagine a 18th century insane asylum to look like.  Love Murray and Hulce in it as well. 9.5/10   Any TV show, book, or movie you can think of.    Hope....the thought that one day, life will be better.   A laptop with a built in printer.  	4
 And there we go   Dawn of the Dead   There's a sub for /r/accidentalswastica we should have one for accidental penis   http://www.eyekandiart.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/green%20pearl%20w%20purple%20black%20edged%20flames%20harley%20davidson%20motorcycle%20custom%20paint%20set%20by%20eye%20kandi%20pic%202.jpg. Basic idea of the concept I mentioned   I've been in the craft beer business for a while.  I even worked for a brewery in Dallas for a few years.  The most aggravating thing was I had no coworkers who could just chill the f*"!k out on good, normal, well made craft beer.  Everyone had to have the biggest, rarest, most elaborate beer to find.  I love craft beer, and the industry.  Not everyone is a hipster, but unfortunately, they're there.   If you want to get eye popping with it, keep the same purple, swap the black with a light metallic green with a lot of shine.  The two colors contrast well together   Really just an excellent ploy to get beer nerds and hipsters to brag about having whale testicles in their mouth.  Way to go Iceland.   In not, but I might, BBC has always been the most impartial news source imo   As you so eloquently put, "you don't pneumonia from cold weather". However, a 67 year old man already had a suppressed immune system (fact, immune systems decline with age one past early adulthood years).  Also, cold weather does suppresses ones immune system (fact). The combination of the two would leave him more susceptible to the disease.  Also, I never stated it was fact.  I just said these were the two versions I've heard.   WE HAVE AN ANGER ROOM IN DALLAS !$ *!!-";%#+- #!!  Holy crap that's where it's going   Had an actual laugh out loud moment with this one. Thanks for sharing   That's amazing.  That might be the must selfless thing I've ever heard.   What was your biggest motivator over the 26 months and what was your final tipping point that inspired you to take action?   Troll 2 is the greatest bad movie ever made.  Easy to find on dvd online, and it may be in netflix.  Don't worry about seeing Troll first.  The two are unrelated.   Yeah, it pulled me back enough to take my hand off the left grip   Come on...  Who wouldn't want a 13 year old television with a busted power button that takes up a ton of space and always has the closed captioning on...?  Its an awesome find   Holy crap you're beautiful   None of them are absolute musts.  I just didn't know if their were any extraction apps.  Any other media sieves would be great.  It would also be nice if their are any apps to cast documents to the Tv   Yikes, that tops mine.  I used to work on the Texas hill country in my very early 20's.  I decided to get a little sun while out riding on my day off and lost the shirt.  I was riding right next to the Guadalupe River and took a cicada going about 60mph.  It struck me about half an inch above the nipple.  Lesson learned.   I'm looking to do a project build similar to this.  I'm interested on sine measurements.  What's the backbone stretch, front leg stretch, rake, and cup size?   I can confirm that, except it was a cicada   Didn't want to go that rout but I think I may   I just got my chrome cast in the mail today and getting my new TV in tomorrow.  Other than netflix, Pandora, and of course Chromecast itself, what are some apps that are must have or y'all would highly recommend?   Just shoot me a pm, here in the comments is fine too.  Remote doesn't work and CC is stuck on.  Its free, just pick it up.  If your going to just plug a DVD player or cable box into it, it works fine.      I've heard two different versions of George Washington's death.  The first the he didn't die of pneumonia, but of syphilis contacted from his mistress.  The other was that he did due of pneumonia.  He was at his mistress' when her husband came home, George Washington peaped out the window nude, in fear of being caught.  He ran a considerable distance home in the snow in the bare, thus contracting pneumonia.   Tl;dr. George Washington would have lived longer if he kept it in his pants   YES!!!!!!!!!   No worries, I'm a cowboys fan.  Jerry is a douche.   Is it just me?  Every time I see Clay Cooley, all I picture is what Will Farrel would look like if he spoofed a used car dealer or someone running for state comp troller?   What ever happens I hope the best for you.  I was madly in love with my best friend in college for 4 years.  I told her how I felt just to finally clear the site and lift the weight.  I knew what her response was going to be, but I manned up.  It got a little rocky for a bit, but soon enough, we were closer than we were before.  What ever happens, I hope happiness for you both.   I did a basic factory reset after T-mobile said that may be the issue   Thanks, it's date night so I'll be spending a good amount of time tomorrow on this   Yes I do.  The factory flas on the phone settings or the kind where I hook my phone up to my pc?   Cool, I know almost nothing of what you said.  But excited someone had the same issue as me.  What was the solution, in plain terms, that a 12 year old could understand   http://imgur.com/MfHmRnR. Not that much actually...   I did have to switch it, but no luck   I've done both, twice, no luck   http://imgur.com/l2NXRxc. Here is what I have space wise.  I've done a factory reset it just takes me back to when the phone updated to Lollipop, didn't fix the problem   I think it's the melodrama in the singer's voice.  I don't know how else to describe it.   sorry, realized that after I hit submit.  I know "us" included peopel it wasn't supposed to.  I guess hwta I meant to type was, "People like Steve Harvey ruin the reputation of Christianity for those, including myself, who don't agree with his closed off, warped, sexist, homophobic and myopic views"   I really want to believe this is a joke or a spoof, buuuuuut........   excellent, thanks   I think one of the biggest reasons to my understanding, was the Judea was expecting more of a more, for lack of a better word, epic Messiah.  I'm having a hard time finding the right words, but to my understanding, the expectation was to be more majestic showing of who the Messiah was.  The concept of a pour carpenter's son, who traveled by foot, and taught peace and patience was unexpected and a little too radical to be believable.   Oh no, I agree, there are others, I don't argue that.  But really, I can only speak for myself and the groups I run in.  Collectively, that's not a good representation of what all of us believe.   Upvote for the lyrical content and yeah, it certainly changes the mood.  But there's something about this song I can't get behind.  It's not yarling, but it's something in the vocals that kills it for me style wise   Cool, thank you.  So I'm completely ignorant on technological issues when it comes to this type of thing.  Step by step, what do I do.  Break it down like I'm 12   This guy (Steve Harvey) seriously ruins Christianity for the rest of us.   (GRANTED I ONLY HAVE 1 SIDE OF THE STORY, I still felt compelled to share)  I (or a friend of mine) can reinforce his absolute horribleness.  A good, trusted friend of mine is a general contractor in the North Dallas area.  He got called to Steve Harvey's Dallas area home a few years back and nearly walked out on the job.  He claimed that Steve Harvey only communicated through yelling and screaming at people and had the inability to actually communicate anything like an actual adult.  He was screaming at the crew, his wife, and his children the second he walked in the door.  He said that when his children came home, ran in the door to great them, Harvey held his son by the nape of his neck and said I, "I don't even want to speak to your ass until you run up stairs and your home work is done."  Once again, it's a second hand account, but I trust this person fairly well.   Is this the same as a factory reset?  I did one of those about 2 weeks after the update and all it did was reset it to when the phone updated to Lollipop, so not an actually factory reset, more like an update reset.   I've posted this on /r/android and have gotten no luck.  Ever since the OS update late November, My cell phone has an extremely low amount of memory and isn't able to make or receive phone calls.  I have a minimal amount of photos on my phone, few unnecessary extra apps, and have removed all music and videos.  Here is what I have: A Google Nexus 5 in good condition, purchased on Amazon.   T-Mobile pay by the month account.   I've done the whole sim card swap through T-Mobile.   Only 2.1 Gig of available space (prior to the update I had a ton of music and photos and still had 12 gig of space left.).   The ability to stream just about anything using LTE.   Use of WiFi.   Ability to make and receive text messages.    What i don't have Insurance on the phone (since purchased in full on amazon, learned my lesson there).   The ability to make and receive phone calls.    I've been to 3 different T-Mobile stores and no one's been able to help so far.  Does anyone have a definitive solution to this problem???   So I spent about 45 seconds looking for the hidden vulgar message...   At least there's the happy ending of Jax and Tara riding off into the sunset. Haha   I think this thread really applies to hire the note was written.  The bite served its purpose well, but just sounded like an idiotic threat the way it was written   She's batshit crazy   Buried in secrets   You seem very smart too   I can't imagine how bad it's going to hurry to pull those off   Who?   Forgot to mention, 30/m, I think it'd be fun   I'd be interested in Skyping...   Still riding the stock 80' with a 4 speed?   Interesting.  I'd love to ride that configuration some time just to try it.  Nothing aggressive, I'm a big fella, don't know if I'd want to put my center of gravity that high   More so than a springer seat?   Fantastic looking bike.  I've always wanted to know, what does the riding position feel like sitting so high on a posted seat?   Gew   Glad I could help. Merry Christmas (if you celebrate something else, Happy That)   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Montgomery  Depends which husband you're talking about.  Not sure.  Very few men deserve a woman of that caliber though.   Agreed.  Not just beautiful but talented and classy.  Bewitched was my mother's favorite show as a child.  On late night Nick at night we would watch reruns when I was little.  Had a crush on her back then, rekindling that admiration now.      Been creeping me the F*** out for 24 years   I believe the proper term in, "Yowza!"   I need that on a t shirt   How is this inappropriate for a 31 year old   That didn't take long   Did I just motorboat Dickbutt?   I am excited about that, going to wait a month or for the price to drop      Thanks   Would be great for /r/creepy   Call me ignorant (I know my inbox is going to blow up for saying that) but what does "Ute" stand for?   10/10 would hit.  Bikini girl wasn't bad either   *Le sigh* oh vista   So, did his amp go up to 11?   Maybe, at least they got a little cash and food from craft services for the month or so during filming.  At best, a permanent job skill and connections.      Plus, just because TM gets sold doesn't mean he'd lose his job, plenty of businesses get sold with little or no staffing changes   I find it interesting (I really do, no judgment passed) that many people who posted on this thread who hate their children never wanted them.  It seems that the child did not much more than be a child, the parent hates them because they never wanted to be a parent in the first place.  It really has little to do with anything the child has done.   Where's the Tim Horton's?   Any idea at all who the model is?   Needs to be on /r/beer   I was very much hoping it was a jot dog from Portillo's   Agreed.  I've known 3 true 1%ers.  He fits the bill.  I'm so glad his character held true through the whole series.  Props to KS for writing his character true through the whole series.  And even more so to Emilio Rivera for executing him so well   Good catch, you're right.  I completely forgot.  So he didn't give up his only son, but still has one son killed to make things even.   Glad I'm not the only one who remembers   Wow, going through the most recent events  in my life.  EAP is so correct   Half Sack, "Hey look!  Its an old fat boy on an old fat boy.....  Sorry"  Juice, "Gemma knows every truth, behind every secret, inside of every lie.  She is the gate keeper"   So that's what I missed.  Made the same mistake.  Got a 96% and couldn't figure it what it was   It was happy, you were right, which member want in the original 9?   The Men of Meg have a boobs to ass ratio requirement, and sorry, but you didn't make the cut   This makes me very proud, I can't wait to move back home next week   Yeah, I know what you mean, I hate it when my owner sticks her ass in my face too   We actually sat and talked for about 5 minutes.  I asked politely for a photo once he was done eating.  After that he asked where I was from/going.  We were in his restaurant and he pretty much asked me a customer service satisfaction survey      Keep going, stay strong   I was really bummed when the gig cut off right before the second guy gets clocked with the bat.  You see it coming.   Eh....  I try to avoid Instagram, cheating ex gf is a sociopath and make my life hell through it, even if I block she'll put up a new profile on their just to find me.  Its a Shane too, I was funding some awesome motorcycle parts through @chopperswapper   I wouldn't be surprised if some how spoilers for next weeks episode show up through my scrolling on Tinder   That's the exact reason I went on media black out when I got home from work, no Facebook, twitter, reddit, any online articles.    My only regret is that I can only up vote this statement once   I second that.  I also ride. 70% of your stoping power is in your front break which is our right hand lever   When he said he was calling it in and she, in short, said she wouldn't go quietly, I was hoping for an epic suicide by cop scenario where Jax watched from a safe distance, they make eye contact, and he nods once as to say, "Now is the time".  Gemma opens fire and 7 or 8 state troopers take her down in a blaze of glory, as Jax watches from his bike.   Go out by Lake Lavon in Collin County, thats the best riding I've found so far.    If you want to make a half day trip out to see a pretty bad ass landmark, go to the Baker Hotel in Mineral Wells TX.  The ride is just okay, but the experience of playing around and taking pictures at a nearly 100 year old, abandoned haunted hotel is worth the ride.     	113
 I realized when I was in third grade and my mom couldn't help with my math homework that not all adults were smarter than me, just older and taller.   THis is a good question for /r/AskScience.   Honda Civic   That people only care about what they can get from you.      I think they'll wait for the UN report.  At least, I hope they do.   I think we should stay out and let them settle their own wars.   Pepper Jack   George W. Bush and his political cronies are responsible for the deaths of over a million Iraqui people and a large number of soldier suicides.  He comes in first place, so far.   It's reasonable for them to leave and it's reasonable for the smoker to make their own decisions and not be told what to do.  What is not reasonable to issue threats to a loved one.   You should check out /r/RoomPorn and some of the affiliated subreddits.  You might get some good ideas there.   Pregnancy.   I've never run into anyone who thought someone else was a demon, let alone call them one.  How offensive were you to them, exactly?   That Papua New Guinea's 'Black Jesus', convicted rapist Steven Tari, was hacked to death.   I don't believe they've presented any evidence, only their word on it.  CNN article on it here: http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/17/opinion/bergen-nsa-spying  "On Thursday, Sens. Ron Wyden and Mark Udall, Democrats who both serve on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and have access to the nation's most sensitive secrets, released a statement contradicting this assertion. "Gen. Alexander's testimony yesterday suggested that the NSA's bulk phone records collection program helped thwart 'dozens' of terrorist attacks, but all of the plots that he mentioned appear to have been identified using other collection methods," the two senators said.  Indeed, a survey of court documents and media accounts of all the jihadist terrorist plots in the United States since 9/11 by the New America Foundation shows that traditional law enforcement methods have overwhelmingly played the most significant role in foiling terrorist attacks."   Mine would be 0.  She's a nice lady who works harder than I do.  I like her.   Being as active and mobile as I am now.  I will not be in 20 years.   I don't agree.  Fox is decidedly conservative while NBC is decidedly liberal.  Guests who appear on those channels or news sites are quickly shot down or bullied due to their opposing positions.  Each one caters to a particular mind set, as do the others.  They can say they're unbiased all they want but it doesn't make it true.   "I just really want an unbiased answer based on facts instead of opinions."  Yeah, don't we all.   Fox News and NBC aren't any different from any other major news site, they just happen to be of a particular point of view opposite to each other.  They're all large corporations going for the money, they all know what sells and they go after it.  There are no completely unbiased news sites and those are as valid as any other.  You have to read both sides to get an idea of the truth.   The only reason I know of to be intentionally fired is to get unemployment.   When it's upvoted it gains a point.  When it's downvoted it loses a point.   The ACLU says it does.

There's no way to know this since war casualties are estimates, and the numbers saved couldn't possibly be ascertained or accurate.   It's bad because this isn't a free advertising website.  If you want to promote yourself you need to pay them for the space.  Otherwise, everybody and his brother would be doing it and reddit would eventually become nothing but an online business listing website.     Buy some paint brushes and hand them over to a bunch of kids with the instruction to make it the Ugliest Truck In The County.  Take pics for prosperity.   Tissues.  I've never had to use them but I have them ready just in case I do.   I've never lost my faith in humanity.   Find a good lawyer to represent me when I was sued in court for theft.   I'd go to work like every other day.  I have no say-so in world affairs.   That if I pulled my dad's finger I'd grow big and tall.  I pulled that finger countless times.   What are you talking about? Black people use the word all the time.  It is not up to me or you to determine if that's offensive to God or if it isn't, or, if that is considered taking the Lord's name in vain since "God" isn't His name.  You should stop and let God do the judging.  You can't put your personal morality on other people.  Do what's right for you and let God take care of the rest.  Will saying the word "fuck" keep me out of heaven, too?   I find it offensive too, but it's their right to say any word they want to.  Make your preference known to the people doing it and then leave it alone.  They're adults with the right to free speech, just like you are.  Remember, you aren't their judge or jury.   At the beach.   Leaving the house soon after breakfast and not coming home until lunchtime.  Leaving after lunch and not coming home until dinner time.   It should not occur at this time.  The US needs to wait for the UN inspector's report and not go in at all without the full support of the UN.   You probably have worms.   The Powerball lottery.   Google how many psychics have been wrong in their predictions.

I'd get what I needed to live, one way or another.   Baking soda.   Try /r/History.   The first moon landing.   Community College for the first two years then transfer to University.  Helps keep the costs down.   I'm never going to be younger than I am right now.   I'll pay less per year if I opt out and just pay the penalty.  I'm paying for insurance now that I don't need, so I might as well pay less for nothing.  If I should need it, it'll be there.   A good question for /r/TrueAskReddit.   People come into your life and people go out.  Just understand that you don't get to keep them, so be happy for whatever time you had together.   It's been there as long as I can remember.   Who's the one determining your death date?  I don't know where to go with this without knowing how it was determined.   Drugging people without their consent is against the law.  I'll relax when *I* want to relax, not when someone forces it on me in the face of sudden death.  This is not a good idea, in my opinion.   I think all their hard work and effort in anything else gets thrown out the door the instant they portray themselves as slutty women.  Got a PhD? No matter, show me that ass.   14 year olds who think they're experts on foreign policy, and  any other subject that comes up.   When one states they want to make an introduction people assume they're new.  Since you aren't, ask whatever you want to.   There isn't a subreddit for introductions, but you could start one.  This is a subreddit for asking questions.   Pusillanimous  Garrulous  Apoplectic  Plinth  Ameliorate  Mastication  Supercilious   Since when has the will of the people made any difference, or even been considered, in war plans and strategies?   Nope, not me, sorry.  I can't tell you that.   I'd buy a new chair I've been looking at for two weeks.   Assad is not a stupid man.  This is part of the plan and he's the sacrificial lamb.  Defense secretaries seem to have a penchant for war and declaring things with no proof but a few internet supplied videos.   Knowing that it would be my last life before going to Heaven.  At least I'd know I had made progress.   A good question for /r/TrueAskReddit.   Cauliflower and collards sauteed in foie gras sprinkled with stinky cheese and served over tongue.   Everyone should have and display good ethical behaviour, no matter what job they have or don't have.  Right and wrong conduct shouldn't be an option in society, but that's why we have laws.   You lack critical thinking skills and can't see what's in front of your face either, apparently.   Yes, *really*.  You'll find out one day.   God has seven eyes that go to and from over the Earth.  Zechariah 4:10   He's omniscient, He sees it and doesn't forget any of it.     Because the US wants a good reason to sell invasion and war to the country.   New York City   I like the view and I'm in no hurry.   Yes, twice.  Scariest thing that's ever happened to me.  I thought I was having a heart attack.  Overwhelming sense of dread.   There used to be one called /r/hiddenrooms, but it's dead now, it seems.  I'd try /r/secretpassages for a start, although there isn't activity there either.  Perhaps you could message one of the mods from those subreddits for an updated place.   I'd explain the situation to the customer and why I can't take any action at this time, take down all pertinent information so that I could get on it first thing Monday morning. Then I'd follow through on my word on Monday.   I'm against killing any animal for reasons other than consumption.  If you're going to eat it then it's ok to use the skin.   You should have asked him to elaborate on that.  That's going to happen no matter a person's age.  I get that crap from 12 year olds.  Everybody's an expert when you disagree with them.   No one cares about your jeans or your shoes.  Stop posting this crap before you're reported.   Print out a note and tape it on the building where they're sure to see it.  Tell them they've been observed participating in illegal activities and if they're seen there again the police will be notified.  You aren't going to stop them no matter what you do, so you might was well warn them to move along.   The majority of Americans don't trust or support them any more than you do.  I wouldn't be surprised if they reach the point of saturation sooner than the government expects.   As long as they don't work together directly and one isn't the others' superior I don't see a problem with it.   I think you've figured out that American citizens are not the government.  Nowadays, they do things without securing proper approval or the citizens' support first.  The majority do not support any intervention in Syria and want more attention paid to domestic issues.   Ferlin Huskey, Mel Tillis, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Conway Twitty,  Tammy Wynette, Hank Williams, Ray Price, Johnny Cash and all those people famous in country music back then.  Here's one of his favorites, [Jim Reeves - He'll Have To Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpi8Bek6jdM)   I don't believe it's your business, either, despite your finger-shaking.   Because it's common courtesy to be respectful to others and some people are more vocal about that expectation.  Those people have lived through far more than you have and have more knowledge and wisdom in things you don't know about yet.   You want hope that things will change just like the rest of us.  I'm afraid that isn't going to happen no matter how much we want it to or spout off on websites.  Climate change is the least of your worries, or should be.  There are far greater evils at work right now over which we have no control.   How old are you?  Are you living at home with parents?   I think they want Assad out one way or another.  If a "threat" to get that ball rolling is required, then a "threat"  is what they will have.   Education, experience and sometimes Google.  Everything's a resource.   DrudgeReport.com   Of course they can.  You don't have to be in every situation but you can certainly have an informed opinion on it.

But they were not ETs.  	107
 Bellonova "MapleLuck" smega spam happens all the time...       I'm kind of a loser but what's the whole thing against early access?    I believe the developers were giving the game out for free, and *might* still be giving them out. If we enjoyed the game we could support by purchasing the game.       They're really filling too! It's by Telegraph and next to CREAM.   Correct!   Actually it's Paula Deen here with a secret: butter.    Sadly I don't have a recipe but if you're ever by Berkeley, find KoJa Kitchen!  	9
 Wat mij betreft word alle drugs verboden of op speciale regeling met artsen die hiervoor geleerd hebben. Je vergeet nu wel dat Heroine dan ook legaal word en Cocaine, Speed en Crack.  Uiteraard mag een mens zelf bepalen wat je met je lichaam doet en het gebruiken is ook niet strafbaar. Er is geen wet dat je de bak in draait als je stijf staat van de speed.   Je mag bepalen wat je neemt maar het is wel de taak van je medemens en overheid om je te beschermen.   zou in theorie toch kunnen? Als de VVD valt hebben ze daar toch beiden profijt van?   Ja maar internet is sowieso een moeilijk onderwerp, want als de politie nu een huiszoeking heeft bij jou thuis is eigenlijk hetzelfde. Vragen ze de code van je kluis heb je 2 keuzes of je geeft de code of ze maken hem zelf even open en dit is volkomen normaal vinden we.   Persoonlijk vind ik dat ze een speciaal bewijs nodig hebben wat ongeveer gelijk staat aan een huiszoeking alleen dan voor je computer in dit geval vind ik dat je dan verplicht je encryptiesleutel moet geven wanneer ze het vragen. Maar vrijwillig zonder reden is niet de bedoeling.   Niet zoals de NSA zomaar alles doen zonder toestemming en lak aan alles heeft.  De rechtsbijstand is toch wel een moeilijk onderwerp ben je onschuldig dan vind ik dat je niet hoeft te betalen voor de advocaat en juridische hulp, maar ben je schuldig vind ik dat je hier zelf voor mag betalen in plaats van de belastingbetaler. Het lijkt me het meest logisch dat ze hier op bezuinigen? Want is het nu niet zo dat schuldig of onschuldig je altijd een advocaat kan krijgen van de overheid?   Het was zeker geen cadeautje wat die vervolgens ook nog is benadrukte..  Natuurlijk moet er openheid van zaken zijn, maar vind het gewoon sneu voor die man dat die waarschijnlijk door dat bedrag meer criminelen heeft kunnen opsluiten en deze manier van handelen word vaak gebruikt: http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma  De PVV en SP zaten al maanden te huilen dat het kabinet moest aftreden volgens mij is dit gewoon geregisseerd door hun.  Van die twee partijen ben ik alles behalve een fan.    Dat ze het hoogste percentage hadden van de stemmers, vergeleken met de andere politieke partijen. Bedoelde ik.   Very informative, but damn he sprints thru those slides.   Het probleem is inderdaad gigantisch en kan no way gestopt worden dat begrijp ik wel. Maar er aan toe geven is ook niet de oplossing. Het is natuurlijk wel zo dat wanneer het op de vrije handel gebeurd we er tenminste nog wat aan verdienen.  Mijn enigste standpunt waarom het niet gelegaliseerd mag worden is de gezondheid, ook al heb je het in de puurste vorm het is nog steeds verschrikkelijk slecht voor je.  En het criminelen circuit zal uiteindelijk toch ook wel de vrije handel overnemen door de producenten te bedreigen/afpersen.   My Cortisol was way to low because of a Hypophysitis what was undiagnosed for along time but i was constantly saying i feel so sick to my doctors and they kept saying yeah it's anxiety and send me home every time so on a saturday I didn't knew my name anymore and I was so sick and so weak I told my dad bring me to a hospital where i have never been he brought me to university hospital and they diagnosed a Adrenal crisis.  Some info what it is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_crisis  After some meds i'm doing much better now and the Hypophysitis  is all gone! And medicine free now!      I feel very sorry for you and on the other hand happy you are still a life, won't tell you hey just go to a nice island and enjoy because that's not what will make you happy at this stage.  But be patience, trust the professionals who are going to help you and someday you are going to be happy.   Stay strong!  edit: some grammar.   Dat het wereldwijd niet goed zit met de handel ben ik totaal met je eens. Maar geregistreerd gebruik kan gewoon niet en vrij verkrijgbaar is toch eigenlijk super raar? Iets zwaardere pijnstiller dan paracetamol zijn niet verkrijgbaar zonder voorschrift maar vervolgens zou je wel cocaine vrij verkrijgbaar kunnen krijgen das toch verschrikkelijk krom?   Persoonlijk denk ik dat de risico's veel duidelijker moeten worden gemaakt in plaats van legaliseren.   Ze maken het echt niet illegaal om je te pesten.     Hard drugs moet zeker niet legaal worden, gecontroleerd of ongecontroleerd. Stel we doen het gecontroleerd dan zou het moeten voorgeschreven worden dan door een Arts? Aangezien we zwaardere pijnstillers dan paracetamol al niet zelf mogen kopen? Het legaal maken lijkt me echt niet de beste oplossing.  edit: comma edit: illegaal moest legaal zijn.   Ja is toch bloed irritant, de meerderheid van het volk heeft gekozen voor 4 jaar VVD, ga dan niet na 2 jaar roepen jaa jullie moeten aftreden. Zo los je nooit wat op.   Die Spong vertelde dat er continu van dit soort deals worden gesloten. Kan me ook iets herinneren van school iets met prisoners dilemma.     Mensen zullen altijd te hard rijden dus daarom het maar legaal maken?   Die beargumentatie slaat natuurlijk nergens op.    drugs legaal? Ben je niet goed?   Vind wel beetje vreemd dat ze hierdoor meoten afstappen terwijl er echt aan de lopende band word gelogen in de tweede kamer.  Die andere partijen proberen de vvd en pvda neer te harken zodat het kabinet valt want let maar op morgen is het gezeik net zo groot en zullen partijen opperen dat het kabinet moet vallen vanwege het achterhouden van informatie of iets dergelijks.  Overigens vond ik het voor Opstelten wel echt tijd worden hoe die soms communiceerde dat kon echt niet meer en aangezien de meeste criminaliteit via het internet plaats vind denk ik al helemaal niet dat hij de juist man was, volgens mij weet die niet eens hoe een telefoon werkt.  Volgens mij was die Teeven zo slecht nog niet.    Steve is on steroids.   This is exactly how I see it. Because a big amount of company's/starters forget the basics of there company and bump right in to the wall when they launch there product.   Off course you need a MVP but I would develop that, make a business plan and then go to the big investors, in some way you have to hand them some proof and you need to show you are well prepared and know where you are talking about.  The way the valley works is not really representative for the rest of the world and you forget that 80% of the startups don't make it or even a higher percentage. But we all know there are really brilliant products in the valley who simply don't make it because of lack of management and wrong planning.  My uncle and the fiance of my mother always said, you can seriously see in a business plan if a company is gonna make or break it and when something doesn't work in a business plan you can always rethink it.  I do like the idea a lot to get in front of your potential customer and get feedback. Although I would consider this as acquisition. This is also very important in your business plan.   You should treat him like every other employe how would function like this.   Following this subreddit for quiet a time now and I would like to contribute some of my knowledge gained by school (marketing student) or at the family dinner table (my moms father developed a certain machine in the agriculture where they are market leader world wide, and mom had a fiance who had leading retail store in my home country in his sector). Its not to brag and im not a specialist but I know a couple of things and would be happy to help out. Off course this isnt how you should do it but maybe you it will help you out a bit.  I get the feeling that allot of people just randomly think: Hey I can build a webshop so im gonna make one and gonna sell what I personally like or what I personally think people would like.. This is your absolute good right to do but the fact of the matter is a very few of this business last for a long time. If not done properly.   Businesses or companys have to be focused on certain problems people are experiencing, or on a certain demand consumers have. This has to be based on facts! Not your own facts but true facts from different sources. I say this because allot of people will make up there own facts because they lose reality. Not that you are insane but you get lost in your own company pretty easy. But you have to remember almost nobody will have the drive and enthusiasm as you have, about your product.  Do you always look at the ads on the internet page, click on them and buy something? If its your own ad it sounds very logical that somebody will click on it, but this isnt the case.  How to get the facts and figures? a **BUSINESS** **PLAN** on paper or made in Words what every you want but it has to be readable for other people. I noticed that seriously a huge group didnt have one and a lot of companys don't make it because of wrong management and lack of structure. It doesnt matter how big or small your company is, you will always need a business plan! It will become something to fall back on especially in the beginning. It will also give you a clear view if you idea/company/business is really worth a try or if its better to find something else.  Where to get one? There are seriously millions of concepts or samples on the internet they are all roughly the same and most of them will always have certain topics that will be discussed. Here are some example sites: http://www.bplans.com/sample_business_plans.php http://www.myownbusiness.org/plans/ When you google business plan sample you will get loads of sites and samples. At the bottom you will find 3 books that I find the most useful so far.  Why a business plan?  It gives you a certain structure on how to work out your business and to target your audience. It will also help allot financially because you have a better idea how much money you will spend on advertising, employees and all other expenses and when you break even or when you will start to make profits.   When you ask advice it is very hard to help you when you dont know your customers profile. Sure you want to sell to all people on this planet, everybody wants that, but that isnt realistic or you have HUGE amounts of advertising money, so especially in the beginning you need to narrow it done a lot: Gender, Age, Country, City, Interest, School, Relation ship, Hobbys, and the list goes on and on and on.  When you have answers to all those demographics you will get a certain customer profile. With this customer profile it is way easier to find the right bloggers/websites/newspapers to work together with and to make a certain social media profile.  Try to narrow your customer profile to lets say your hometown, college, university, church this are just some examples but I think you will know what I mean with the size of your target group. When you reached all of your prospects or you reached your goals you move on to a bigger market so you can take away some of your demographics to grow and advertise bigger.  But by far the most important thing is to develop a strong and good business plan it sounds a little dull but it will teach you a great amount of marketing and in general about developing a business because you have to research a huge amount of information.   The business plan is very hard work but it will help you allot!  Some books that will help out: The lean startup by Eric Ries How make friends and influence them by Dale Carnegie (this is on of the best books I have ever read) Marketing fundamentals by Bronislaw J. Verhage (In Holland this is the standard book for marketing at college/university.)  And google has all your answer if you don't know a technical term. So does the reddit community.   But asking this is my website and I want more customers can you help me out. The answer that you will get will be so unhelpful in 80% of the time because the possibilities are endless.      Thanks! May I ask why the aVF lead is almost flat?      Thanks for quick response.  Weird they still put those interpertation software in the machines when it is wrong quiet a few times.  But thanks again!      Great to see the dog is still alive! The men should be proud for saving the dog!  By the way why does the nurse have a hard on?   Marketing student here I'm glad to help out a bit.  First of try to read some books about marketing, Philip Kotler is a well respected marketing professor who wrote allot of good books try to buy or borrow some. Also coursera.org maybe has some marketing courses you can follow but I don't know if there are any at the moment.     Why is this important?  It will help you to develop mission and vision, this is the most important thing of a company. From there you can develop your strategy.  An example of a mission, Facebook: "Facebooks mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. People use Facebook to stay connected with friends and family, to discover whats going on in the world, and to share and express what matters to them."  With something like this in the back of your head you always know what direction you have to go with you company.  Do you want to focus on a niche market? Or do you want to focus on every household? Hipsters/rockers/hippies etc etc. This will help you to find the right places to advertise. But you want to advertise as little as possible with Facebook ads, magazine adds, newspapers ads those are very expensive and at this point you have to be very creative. You want that people find your products cool, so send some stuff to blogggers/youtubers and stuff like that who are interested in these products and are already talking about it maybe getting a shout out in exchange for some discount and that there viewers can get some discount?  Try to contact fancy.com they have very cool stuff and your products would fit in I guess. But you have allot of similar websites. A problem however with this type of selling is that there is another chain in the distribution channel and the more channels in there the more expensive your products get or the less profit you will make. There is also a chance that the manufacturer are already approaching them. But trying will never hurt you. Or maybe you can have a joint venture with them.   Now off to the social media. You need to add value to you posts not only "Hi there here is a picture of a product this is the price, buy it". Try to add value like simple facts: when the product was founded originally or something else people didn't knew about the product in general, they have to be amazed. People need to enjoy following your channel.   About the flyers I would seriously consider to stop with those, they are very expensive. Unless they give you a solid income. Always keep in mind I want to reach as much people with the least amount of money spent.   Now about the website im gonna explain it like im doing a live review.  Nice designed website with some great products! But a very wide product range, from bikes to hotdogs machines and from gameboys to a TETRIS blocks lamp. O boy I get very hungry of all those nice machines, Yes sir im hungry! Go to the menu lifestyle: No food machines huh they also sell bathroom products? And prints?  Arcade: No food machines,  Records: No Food machines and also I have to be honest I was expecting some CDs and Vinyls here maybe it is an idea to change Records in to Audio or audio products or something like that, Gifts: No food machines again but phone cases. So the food machines arent in the menu so only on the homepage.  The Menu is not well organized in my opinion and I dont get a good idea of what are all the types of products you are selling at the first glance of your website. Seriously try to reorganize the menu that with every click in the menu I know what im doing.  So my advice: Work on the menu make it very logical!  When visiting the homepage it has to be clear what you are selling.  Start studying some marketing it will help you allot and its also allot of fun to learn how people think. It will also provide you with some easy tools for example a SWOT analysis and allot more of that type of tools.   Target your audience, it will be a lot easier to find you customers then because you know where to search. But again this is very hard and you maybe have to delete some products out of your company for that.  The social media part I would recommend to make it more informative and fun to follow with nice facts!   But the most important advice: Enjoy your brand new company!And truly give your soul and heart for it! And Congratulations!  Its a bit late now and im very tired + english is not my native language so im already apologizing for the bad grammar. Will read the whole text tomorrow again and where necessary I will make some logical corrections.  If you have more question or you need explanation feel absolutely free to ask and i will answer as soon as possible.   Well that a bit the brutal way, I was more thinking about a peaceful way.   Thanks!   Thanks!   With your own constitution, army, tax and stuff like that?   Do you have some articles about this? I'm very interested to read this! Because where I live they government is investing in all different cultures.   I read the article but the article is written in a context you think it only happens to "black" people, because they say we get POOR black guys  instead of a RICH white guy because they can afford a lawyer. This is a HUGE difference because this doesn't say its a racial thing but a money/wealth thing. White poor people have the same chance to get caught here as the poor black people.  I do believe there is racism and the world doesn't end with me. But it's getting so misused.  Not every time you are being treated bad you can't just say o thats racism!    	33

I love Leo, his work, his vocal skills, his longevity, but he proudly proclaims "I hide nothing, I want Google to know EVERYTHING about me",   so on, then comes all the issues you cited above. Really? Quelle surprise. As a mod of long-standing on reddit, with experience at Digg, NewsPond, Mixx blah blah I can honestly say you don't DEFEAT trolls, you deal with them. Closing down the online AI of TWiT is not "dealing" with anything, it's an admission of defeat,   that is a crying shame. Jeff Jarvis argues against such a stance on TWiG iirc. Odd thought, I'm listening to this week's Windows Weekly now,   Leo is referring to the chat room like nothing has happened? Am I missing something?  Edit: I'm not sure I see the correlation between shutting down live-streaming   trolls/bomb-threats etc? Why can't they live-stream without a live audience then? We'd still like to see what goes on behind-the-scenes/between-shows?

Hey, Uncle Leo, pay me! I mod /r/tnt, /r/iostoday   /r/twitaaa for you :)   Oh I don't know about that. They turn up with all their placards, ready to chant, and suddenly all they can see is white sheets, quite hilarious, imagining them on a knoll muttering amongst themselves               Oh right, I never really look at that :)  	151

Try [making a pudding](http://ozlemsturkishtable.com/2012/09/milk-pudding-with-mastic-gum-and-rhubarb-compote/ ) from it instead of making Turkish Karanmaras dodurmasi as others have suggested which, at least when I've tried it in Turkey, doesn't really have much mastic flavor. oh and also Sahadi's is the best!   visa versa = why does a sponge become a brownie?!   uh, it would be kaleidoscopic and beautiful!    ramen?   At least on my instrument, that issue wouldn't make a sound. it would just be leaky and perhaps make the note out of tune. The reeds only sound from one direction and the leather prevents air from going through when the bellows are going the other way   Sorry I misspoke, I was referring to a putty knife not an offset spatula. Great for omelets, anything on a skillet, cleaning your cutting  board. I'm not professional but recently I've noticed one in every single professional kitchen I've peeked in. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putty_knife  	22
                                                       The data is downloaded from Robert Margot (1993).  In Excel, I plotted the official and the Michael Darby estimates from 1975 of unemployment in the USA in the 1930s.                                                                                                                                                Would have made chart too cluttered.    The data was downloaded from the OECD family database.   In Excel, I plotted the percentage of workers who worked more than 50 hours per week for all countries that a member of the OECD except Turkey and Mexico.   The data was downloaded from the OECD family database.  In Excel first plotted the life expectancy and healthy life expectancy of women in a stacked bar chart. I then plotted the life expectancy and healthy life expectancy of men in a stacked bar chart.   The data was downloaded from the OECD family database.  In Excel, I plotted the tertiary education attainment rates of men and women aged 25 to 34 for Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland, the USA and the UK.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  A marvellous discussions of the risks and rewards of symbolic action such as campaigning for fossil fuels disinvestment when it has an opportunity cost.   When you are campaigning for fossil fuels disinvestment you're taking time away from  campaigning for cap and trade and other options that really will make a difference.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  George Will makes an excellent case against capital punishment based on practical objections and the enormous resources wasted for little result.   The data was downloaded from the OECD family database.  In Excel, I plotted the gender wage gaps for full-time workers who were tertiary education graduates and those who did not go beyond high school.   The data was downloaded from the OECD family database.  I plotted the gender wage gaps for the bottom, top and middle deciles in Excel for Australia, New Zealand, the USA, the UK, Canada and Ireland.    I downloaded the data on gender wage gaps from the OECD family database for rural, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, USA and Ireland. I then plotted that data for these Anglo-Saxon countries in Excel.   I downloaded the working age population data from OECD Stat Extract; I downloaded the real GDP, PPP data from the conference board total database.  I then in Excel, divided the working age population data of Britain and France with their real GDP, PPP from 1950 to 2013.  In Excel, I then detrended the growth rates of real GDP, PPP per British and French by 1.9% to identify eras of the above than by the low average growth in these countries.   I then annotated the resulting chart with the classic descriptions of eras such as "never had it so good", "British disease" and Thatcheromics.    I did use the exact title. What gives+   I downloaded the data from the OECD Better Life Index. I then plotted it in Excel to see where New Zealand fitted into this chart   I downloaded data on consumer prices and household energy prices from Statistics New Zealand Infoshare.   I then plotted that data in Excel in one chart starting from 1995 showing the ratios of household energy prices to the consumer price index. I then plotted both the consumer price index and household energy prices index in another chart in Excel starting in 1975.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  I don't live in America so I didn't realise how devastating it is to your life if you accidentally have your Social Security number deactivated   I read the entire budget papers for the last eight New Zealand budgets to collate in Excel information on business subsidies, both in cash and in kind.  I then plotted that data on corporate welfare in the finance, transport, economic development, science and innovation, communications, Primary Industries, and tourism portfolios in Excel.   The data is downloaded from the OECD employment protection index.  The OECD employment protection index for each OECD member was plotted in Excel both for individual dismissals and for collective dismissal to see among other things where New Zealand stands.   I downloaded the data from OECD Focus on Minimum Wages after the crisis 2015.  In Excel, I plotted data on how many weekly hours worked was required to be above the 50% poverty line for a single parent with two children working on the minimum wage Net of taxes and family benefits in Australia, New Zealand, the USA, UK, Ireland and Canada.   The data is downloaded from OECD Focus on Minimum Wages after the crisis 2015.  In Excel, I plotted the pay of a 5% minimum wage increase for a minimum wage worker who is a single parent of two children after deducting taxes and Social Security contributions and adding any family benefits in the tax and welfare system for Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the UK, Canada and the USA.   I downloaded the data from  OECD Focus on Minimum Wages after the crisis 2015.  I plotted that data for the UK, Ireland, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand on after-tax pay in Excel.   I downloaded the data from OECD Stat Extract. I then plotted that data for union density in Britain, France, Germany and Italy in Excel.   When doing some research into the economics of natural disasters after the Christchurch earthquake, I looked up rent control and track down the famous pamphlet George Stigler and Milton Friedman in 1946.  To my astonishment, it started with a discussion of the housing market in San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake and compared to its functioning to the housing market in the same city after World War II rent controls to see which coped better.   I downloaded data from OECD Stat Extract on French, German and Italian unemployment rates since 1956 and plotted it on a chart in Excel.   The data is from Jon Bakija, Adam Cole and Bradley T. Heim Jobs and Income Growth of Top Earners and the Causes of Changing Income Inequality:  Evidence from U.S. Tax Return Data.  I tabulated in Excel the 1979 and 2005 shares of income by top 1% and top 0.1% occupations.   To present that data in a unique way, I sorted the 1979 in 2005 income shares by the occupations from the smallest to largest increase in income shares of the top 1% and top 0.1% between 1979 in 2005.   The data on the composition of the incomes of the top 0.1% in the USA in Canada is from the world top incomes database.  Firstly for the USA I plotted the shares of income coming from wages, salaries and  pensions or from entrepreneurial income in Excel. I then plotted a separate chart showing how much of the incomes of the top 0.1% in the USA came from dividends, interest and rents respectably.  The same charts were then plotted in Excel for Canada of wages, salaries and pensions and entrepreneurial incomes and for dividends, interest and rents for the top 0.1%.   Australian detrended growth barely changed in mining boom   The data is from OECD StatExtract and the conference board total database.   I first calculated real GDP per working age Canadian, Australian and New Zealand PPP by dividing their real GDPs PPP by their working age populations from 1956 and then plotted that in Excel.  Next, I detrended the three data series of growth in real GDP per working age Canadian, Australian and New Zealand by 1.9% from 1956 and plotted that in Excel.     The tax revenue data is from OECD StatExtract. In Excel, I plotted the tax revenues as a percentage of GDP for Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA from 1965.   Didn't know that. Who defines this?   The data is from OECD StatExtract. In Excel, I plotted the tax revenue data for Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland as a percentage of GDP from 1965 onwards.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  A nice summary of the view that colonisation made Africa worse off. P.T. Bauer had a different view   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  Kuran is an excellent writer always worth reading who has studied in depth the economics of history of the Middle East.   The data was extracted from OECD Stat Extract. In Excel, I plotted the tax revenue to GDP ratios of France, Germany, the UK and USA from 1965 to 2013.   The data is from the OECD family database. In Excel, I plotted the rates of non-employment and part-time employment of sole parents with their youngest children aged 3 to 5.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT New research suggests that competent employees are assigned more workbut they don't always like it.   The data is from OECD StatExtract. In Excel, I constructed separate data series for men and women by unemployment duration of a year or more for Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the USA and UK.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  Interest in analysis regarding the ability of terrorists to impose their will. I think terrorists get their way little more often than he says   The data is from StatExtract. I extracted the data from 1960 onwards on trade union densities for Australia, New Zealand, the UK and the USA then plotted them in Excel to see what trends appeared.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  A nice discussion of the role of motivated reasoning in rejecting scientific findings.  In modern politics, you don't give an inch so you reject the science because you don't like the economic solutions that would result even though you may have independent and valid reasons on economic grounds for rejecting the proposed solutions. It's a tactical mistake to concede anything in modern politics   SUBMISSION STATEMENT Timely excerpt from the writings of John Stuart Mill on how abuse of power is more likely when government is trying to prevent crimes than when it is punishing it after the fact.   The data is from OECD StatExtract. In Excel, I plotted minimum wages for Australia, New Zealand, the UK and USA as a percentage of both the mean and median wage of a full-time worker since 1960. The Australian data series does not quite run as far back as that while the UK did not have a minimum wage until the late 1990s.   No data available   No data in database.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  Urban progressives favor deregulationbut only for things they like or want to do.   The data is from the OECD family database. In Excel, I plotted the employment rates of sole parents about children aged 6 to 14 by whether they are not employed or working part-time for OECD member countries that have this data available   SUBMISSION STATEMENT   Excellent roundup of the economic literature and other relevant literatures on the impact of the decriminalisation of marijuana on the demand for marijuana   The data was from the OECD family database. I collated and plotted the relevant data in Excel on the employment rates of sole parents who have children under the age of two who were either not working or working part-time   In Excel, I calculated French and German real GDP as percentage of British real GDP PPP using data are from the Maddison database   I used GDP data from the Maddison database to calculate US and Canadian real GDP per capita as a percentage of British GDP and plotted that all in Excel.   I used data from the top incomes database to plot in Excel the top incomes shares in Australia for the top 10%, top 5%, top 1% and top 0.5%.   In Excel, I used the Maddison Project database to calculate and plot real GDP per capita for the USA, UK and Canada from 1775. The Canadian data was rather incomplete prior to 1870.   A you saying there is no raw gender gap?   In Excel, I used real GDP purchasing power parity data from the Maddison database to plot per capita incomes in the UK, Australia and New Zealand since 1820. I then plotted three pairwise comparisons in Excel in separate charts to ease the burden on the eye.   How do you know whether she did not work on minimum wage while at college?   Medicaid and CHIPS in USA    In Excel, I plotted the earnings of the top 10%, top 5%, top 1% on top 0.5% to see how much income In New Zealand they had to bring in a year to be in those income classes. The data was from the top incomes database   99% of robots agree see https://www.facebook.com/Robots4MinimumWage/photos/pb.1405786186396254.-2207520000.1431750997./1422236028084603/?type=3 src=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fhphotos-xpf1%2Ft31.0-8%2F10986830_1422236028084603_1370941682188473176_o.jpg smallsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fhphotos-xfa1%2Fv%2Ft1.0-9%2F11169885_1422236028084603_1370941682188473176_n.jpg%3Foh%3D1f0b54d05361577c33e3f077db5d7f5d%26oe%3D55D72C1F size=1224%2C816 fbid=1422236028084603   In Excel, I first divided real GDP PPP from the conference board total economy database by the working age populations of the UK, Australia and New Zealand from the OECD StatExtract. I then detrended that data by 1.9% and plotted that separately in another chart using Excel   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  A nice roundup of empirical findings about the micro-finance literature   I used the top incomes database to calculate and plot a chart of top 1% incomes for New Zealand, Australia and the USA with the latter two with the comparators   I thought the argument that communism will become Stalinism has been won.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A nice case the most effective antipoverty tool in the public policy kitbag in the latter half of the 20th century   Quite true. I did put the link up as an example of bad economics in the popular press  breathless journalism   There is plenty of gender wage gap data about but not so much for the gender wage gap with the presence of children.  I therefore in Excel calculated the gender wage gap across all the OECD countries from the presence of children for women aged 25 to 44, using data from the OECD Closing the gender gap: Act now database So The motherhood penalty could be compared with other gender wage gaps.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  Nice little summary of the literature pointing out that women on low economic trajectories have children for quite rational reasons without getting married   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  Libertarians do attract a lot of comment and the Twitter Left is rather keen to label the right-wing opponents, as libertarians. This is despite the fact a lot of voters don't understand what a libertarian is.  Indeed, back in the 1990s, most libertarian gatherings were so small that they would not need to book ahead at a restaurant to make sure they got a table.  It is only recently that Milton Friedman became a respectable figure in policy circles. Indeed, at job interviews in the 1990s, if you mentioned Hayek's name, and there is any sign of name recognition, you would been interviewed by a very well read people.   In Excel,  I used total hours worked data from the conference board database and then divided by the working age population is from OECD StatExtract   That's the whole point of the op-ed: land prices may go up or down quite significantly. The outcome of analysis is thoroughly ambiguous   SUBMISSION STATEMENT A reviw of Paul Offits new book that chronicles the destructive impact of the anti-vaccination movement.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  Nice little paper pointing out what should be obvious to everyone. Nonviolent protest can entice sympathy and support from the majority. Violent protests have the exact opposite effect, including a law and order backlash among voters.  Roundabout way of saying that a Republican won the 1968 election on a law and order platform, not a Democrat on a peace platform.  As I recall my warned over Marxism, is the idea of violent protests to exit provoked that backlash and the resulting repression cause the proletariat to see that capitalists for whom they are and rise up and overthrow them.    In Excel, I calculated real American Canadian GDP PPP per working age person using population data from OECD Stack Extract and real GDP data from the conference board, total database. I then detrended that data by 1.9%.   I also then included an Excel chart of tax revenues to GDP from both countries from the OECD databases.   the Left discovered tax incidence theory   dogs are used is ice breakers in many public situations    Like LDP, UKIP wins protest votes. When they wins seats, and get into government, they lose votes fast.   A UKIP vote is a signal of a grumpy Tory parking their vote until there is policy change.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A great little roundup of the case for deregulation of land supply and urban form   Data on unemployment rates from OECD StatExtract were plotted in Excel to see what the Canadian and American unemployment rates looked like over the last 50 years   I used data from OECD Stat Extract to construct the respective unemployment rates in Excel   does not understand the division of labour and increasing returns to specialisation based on even tiny differences in comparative advantage   But it applies the median voter theorem to key issue   Median voter theorem   I calculated real GDP PPP per working age British and Irish in Excel by dividing their working age populations from OECD StatExtract into real GDP data PPP from the conference board, total database.  I then detrended these real GDP data series by their respective trend rates of growth: 1.9% for the UK and 3.6% for Ireland.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT   Light penalties widely applied and serious penalties applied to a few can both deter unlawful behaviour. But in the case of riots, it is hard to prove wrongdoing and important to clear the streets. Arresting widely and temporarily can be more effective.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  Arrests for alleged violent crimes were involved in three of every four reported homicides by law enforcement personnel - a force-on-force situation, such as an intervention with an ongoing assault, robbery or murder    SUBMISSION STATEMENT  A nice little roundup of life before vaccines became available shortly before I was born when which means I was lucky   In an historic building, it is normally impossible to change any of the exterior of the building. Routine repairs attract scrutiny and as for the chances of any renovation that changes the building, forget it   In Excel, I first computed real GDP PPP per working age person for Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain using working age population data from OECD StatExtract and the conference board, total database on real GDP levels PPP.  I then detrended growth in the four countries by 1.9%.   I used Excel to divide the working age populations of Italy, Germany and France into real GDP PPP since 1950. I then detrended those series by 1.9% to see when there was above and below trend growth.  The working age population data was from OECD StatExtract; the real GDP PPP data was from the conference board, total database.    Is an opportunity to apply your own economic skills to what he is saying   Thanks for these superb link. Christina Romer writes some really good stuff   When I have time, I'll dig out an article written by Paul Krugman in 1998, making the exact same points as the American Enterprise Institute, but with a more detailed analysis of the fiscal politics.   Using Excel, I first constructed real GDP per working age person using working age population data from OECD Statextract which was then divided into real GDP PPP data from the conference board, total database.  I then detrended the real GDP growth data for Sweden, Britain and also the USA as a comparator by 1.9% using Excel to plot the data.   I used Excel to plot data from my country and for the USA from a comprehensive international database at the Federal reserve bank of Dallas on housing prices.    They have 5 seats. Could be the difference.   You could be right. Wasn't that 600 million years ago?   where?   I used Excel and Open Office Draw to divide real GDP purchasing power parity for New Zealand, Switzerland and Australia from the conference board total database by their respective working age populations from OECD statextract.  I compared New Zealand and Swiss GDP per working age person with that in Australia to show a normal economy as compared to two in long depressions.  I then detrended real GDP purchasing power parity per working age New Zealander, Swiss and Australian by 1.9% to show that Swiss and New Zealand economies had deviated by 30% or more from trend between the 1973 and the early to mid-1990s. That is, both economies were in a great depression over those respective periods.   The point of the article title written in Australian English is irony: after decades and decades of mass use and but one death and that is disputed apparently   I reproduced a UK chart for New Zealand using Excel to analyse 2013 Census data to create several pie charts and a time series chart to show the extent to which a Generation Rent has emerged in New Zealand in the last 10 years.  I then used the economist housing price index tool to create individualised charts to see how housing affordability had tracked the emergence of generation rent in New Zealand and Australia.    SUBMISSION STATEMENT  LBGT people probably are attracted to jobs that either: (a) require subtle interactional skills, which they have cultivated because they live in a hostile environment, or  (b) they seek jobs where they can work by themselves so they dont have to deal with hostility or constantly trying to stay submerged.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  Yet another excellent application of the Dunning Kruger effect. The notion that opinions are equal implies nobody is wrong and nobody is right   In a disappointing omission by a newspaper that fancies itself was the newspaper of record for America, the New York Times article did not mention that teenage girls simply are much better at reading in PISA tests than teenage boys and therefore will make different career choices to men because they want to take advantage of their full mix of skills   Maybe you do not understand the larconic tone of the Australian English title   What do you mean?   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A wonderful collection of data and surrounding discussions that shows how rapid social change can be. People think nothing ever changes, but the article shows things can change and change rapidly.   None of the British reporting I have seen, such as in the Guardian point to examples where rent controls are kept rents down without supply falling short of demand.   The offsetting behaviour effect found by the study reported in this post is simply brilliant   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A relatively impartial and balanced roundup of presidential deceptions over the last 60 years and their consequences. Well worth reading, especially if you're a political junkie.   I thought the recent elections weren't too bad in that there were actually some issues in the election that were not sectarian.   I'm told water pricing was a big issue in a recent election. That was big achievement because it wasn't a sectarian issue   Russia is going through the same sort of process with Stalin. They either love him or hate him.  The blogger linked from is fascinated with dictators and is very good at explaining things such as cults of personality and why dictators can be personally popular despite the rest of their administration been extremely unpopular with ordinary people.  Abandon footnotes is one of the best blogs I have come across in the last few months   Thanks. The particular blog the link came from, which is based across town from me seems to be fascinated with Spanish history and politics, particularly anything to do with dictators.  Last time I put a link on history sub Reddit it was deleted because I didn't include a comment summarising the link. Not easy to put in a comment when you're operating off the mobile phone or tablet rather than your desktop.   Monopsony is a bit overrated in my view particularly for unskilled workers who can actually move into a lot more jobs than I can as a University graduate   I used Excel to deduct the usual 1.5% bias because of new goods, quality variation and the like from the consumer price index inflation rates of Germany, France and the UK.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  A nice little roundup of the constitutional protections of the rights of parents vis-a-vis their children over the years in the Supreme Court   All agree that the consumer price index (CPI) is biased and overstates inflation. In 1996, economists hired by the Senate Finance Committee estimated that the U.S. CPI overstates annual inflation by 1.1% (Boskin et al. 1996). That estimated CPI bias has not gotten smaller with time. It is now up to 1.5%, even 2%.  I thought I might see what happened if I I used Excel two take account of this one and a half percentage point annual bias because of new goods, quality variation and other known biases in the CPI estimates for the USA, UK and Japan in the relevant OECD StatExtract database for annual CPI inflation.    In addition to the 20% of College males will have an off-campus girlfriend one or two years younger, you must remember Seinfeld's law: 20% of the population are undateable.  As a college bound young woman is most likely quite datable, they will suffer in particular from Seinfeld's law cutting 20% off pool of college-age boys.   I use Excel to chart the Cara McDaniel database for the average tax rate on labour income and capital income, the average tax rate on consumption expenditure and investment expenditures and Social Security contributions for the United States, Canada and then the UK, all calculations from 1950.  I then use Excel to calculate real GDP per working age American, Canadian and British by taking working age population data from OECD StatExtract and dividing it by real GDP purchasing power parity data from the conference board, total database from 1950.   The average tax rates on consumption, investment, labour and capital for Australia and New Zealand are constructed in Excel from a database developed by Carla McDaniel from her Ph.D.  These trends in average tax rates for Australia and New Zealand are then compared with the performance of their economies with an Excel chart constructed from working age population data in OECD StatExtract and real GDP PPP data from Conference Board Total Database, January 2014.    Using Excel, I compare data on annual hours worked per engaged person tweeted by Max Roser with an annual hours worked per working age person series with the USA, Germany, West Germany and France.  I constructed this series with Excel using working age population data from OECD StatExtract and total hours worked data from the conference board total database. These series started in 1950 or 1956.  I then used Excel to construct average tax rates on labour income from Cara McDaniel's website to calculate average tax rates on labour incomes in the USA, Germany and France since 1950 to explore reasons for the differences between the Max Roser tweet data and mine.    The working age population data is from OECD StatsExtract. Excel is then used to divide that into  real GDP PPP data from the conference board, total economy database, which is then detrended at 1.9% per year for both economies.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  With the exception of Israel, the Middle East allies of the United States are the type of friends that make you prefer your enemies. Indeed, in Syria, apart from the Kurds, very hard to find anyone you want to line up with.    Homeopathy has been part of the NHS since its foundation. There was even a homoepathic Hospital, which I think closed recently   Detrended with Excel using data from the OECD StatsExtract and from the Conference Board Total database using trend growth rates frequently employed by Edward Prescott and his writings on Japan and USA respectively.   Yes, a great list of yours   Base 100, 2005   This was graphed with Excel from the Dallas Fed's international housing price database   yes   Goods and services tax. The other name for the value added tax VAT   Graphed from OECD tax databases using excel.    Graphed from OECD tax data bases   Those neoliberal tax reforms saved the welfare state.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  When Brennan said at a tax reform conference in Australia over 20 years ago that efficient taxes and tax reforms are both bad because they lead to higher taxes and a larger government, no one understood him.  Idealists all, the audience, including me, assumed they were advising a benevolent government, not a revenue-maximising leviathan government  a beast that needed to be staved with constitutional constraints on the number and size of tax bases and tax instruments.  Fiscal arrangements were analysed by Buchanan and Brennan in The Power to Tax in terms of the preferences of citizen-taxpayers who are permitted at some constitutional level of choice to select the fiscal institutions they are to be subject to over an uncertain future.  Those in elected office are assumed to exploit the powers assigned to them to the maximum possible extent: government is a revenue-maximising leviathan.  Buchanan and Brennan were all for inefficient tax systems because they do not raise as much revenue. A government that cannot raise much revenue cannot grow very large.  It was a number of years before I came to agree with Brennan and Buchanan. I had to break out of my applied welfare economics thinking and move over to constitutional political economy.  Tax reform saved the late 20th century welfare state by raising the same or more revenue with less taxpayer resistance.  	196
       i remember seeing photos, which the FBI provided, with the guy in the doorway BLACKED OUT...(there's a photo of him crouching in the doorway in the video you linked to)      do a search within r/conspiracy...then pick and choose  also [whowhatwhy.org](http://whowhatwhy.org/) has a series which does not go into conspiracies but, instead, simply asks valid questions about the "investigation"   Everyone must be a detective...Each source must be measured and weighed accordingly...the corporate main stream media is, far too often, complicit in covering up facts and even goes as far as omitting the entire story...case in point: the build up to the Iraq War (see Bill Moyer's [BUYING THE WAR](https://vimeo.com/33033186))...the New York Times, still to this day, covers up any possibility that there was a conspiracy in the JFK whackjob. these cover-ups or omissions are referred to as Deep Politics by researcher/author Peter Dale Scott.    History matters because we must know what happened in order to judge if our government is acting responsibly. As it stands We, the People cannot do this because the USG allows the CIA-FBI-NSA to hide such a large portion of our own history from us. Why is the USG hiding the security footage from the 89 cameras which the FBI confiscated from around the Pentagon on 9/11???  Why does the USG not allow us to view records from WWII??? There are even records from the 1920 bombing of Wall Street which a Yale history professor, Beverly Gage, was not allowed to view for her book *The Day Wall Street Exploded* (2008).  In fact, the USG would not release even 1 new file even though the files were 85 years old.  How do we know if the FBI or CIA or NSA are acting within the law???  How do we know if the CIA or NSA or the Pentagon haven't taken control of the USG???    Answer: We can't know how to judge their actions if We, the People are not given access to their files. Of course, the agencies may omit information, but most likely there will be clues left for researchers to decipher.   I have started a subreddit, [r/TSBD](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/), which is focused on pdf files of "conspiracy" books and author interviews as a reference tool.

Culled from the agencys in-house journal, Studies in Intelligence, the materials include a previously unreleased six-page article titled Managing a Nightmare: CIA Public Affairs and the Drug Conspiracy Story. Looking back on the weeks immediately following the publication of Dark Alliance, the document offers a unique window into the CIAs internal reaction to what it called a genuine public relations crisis while revealing just how little the agency ultimately had to do to swiftly extinguish the public outcry. Thanks in part to what author Nicholas Dujmovic, a CIA Directorate of Intelligence staffer at the time of publication, describes as a ground base of already productive relations with journalists, the CIAs Public Affairs officers watched with relief as the largest newspapers in the country rescued the agency from disaster, and, in the process, destroyed the reputation of an aggressive, award-winning reporter.   -------------      It wouldn't concern me if she had beaten an attorney or a banker (of any race) like that, but this seems like senseless violence.

In order to be included in the Victims Families Fund, participation was placed under a 2 year timeline imposed by Feinberg. Was the 2 year time period imposed by Feinberg also a factor in mandating the 9/11 Commission Report be finished in such a short 16 month time frame? obviously there was an election--but i think the 2 year time frame was a more important consideration for the Bush-Cheney administration.  wonder if there are any Feinberg-Cheney ties (Cheney does go all the way back to the Nixon era)...wonder if Cheney ever came across Feinberg during the Agent Orange lawsuits (Cheney was Sec. of Defense under GHW Bush when some of the Agent Orange settlements may have been active...not sure, but I think Feinberg may have worked on the Agent Orange settlements.)  I also wonder how the [9/11 Victims' Compensation Fund](http://cryptome.org/doj122101.txt) was written, voted on and passed by Congress in just 10 fucking days--on Sept. 21...obviously the u.s. was stricken with fear and congress would have put their stamp on just about anything at the time--the important thing for the Compensation Fund was to put victims/families into the lawsuit and thereby placing them under some secrecy rules which the victims and families most likely had to agree to. Overall, Cheney saw the 9/11 Victims' Families Compensation Fund as a way to SILENCE those closest to the scene of the crime...these 9/11 victims and families were those with the most interest in asking questions and demanding answers--a very important group to silence (or at least have under official observation and controllable).   Anyone else remember that in [Sept 2002: 1,400 victims/families of the 9/11 attacks sued Iraq for $1 TRILLION](http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?timeline=complete_911_timeline the_post-9/11_world=complete_911_timeline_9_11_related_lawsuits)...

Not long after this meeting, Saddam Hussein began preparing to make the switch from pricing his countrys oil exports in greenbacks to euros. As renegade and newsworthy as this action was on the part of Iraq, it was sparsely reported in the corporate-controlled media.  Clark comments on the limited media coverage on page 31 of his book:  CNN ran a very short article on its website on October 30, 2000, but after this one-day news cycle, the issue of Iraqs switch to a petroeuro essentially disappeared from all five of the corporate-owned media outlets. By 2002, Saddam had fully converted to a petroeuro  in essence, dumping the dollar.  On March 19, 2003, George W. Bush announced the commencement of a full scale invasion of Iraq.  According to Clark and Engdahl, Saddams bold threat to the petrodollar system had invited the full force and fury of the U.S. military onto his front lawn.  http://ftmdaily.com/preparing-for-the-collapse-of-the-petrodollar-system-part-3/  ----------------   --------------------------  No proof of that...but [Bush and Cheney did, on multiple occasions, ask Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle NOT to investigate 9/11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0)...neither Bush nor Cheney would  testify under oath and in public before the 9/11 Commission...

WHO wants to read about that???   ----------  from Prologue:  No longer a traditional espionage service devoted to stealing the secrets of foreign governments, the Central Intelligence Agency has become a killing machine, an organization consumed with man hunting.  And just as the CIA has come to take on tasks traditionally associated with the military, with spies turned into soldiers, so has the opposite occurred. The American military has been dispersed into the dark spaces of American foreign policy, with commando teams running spying missions that Washington would never have dreamed of approving in the years before 9/11. Prior to the attacks of September 11, the Pentagon did very little human spying, and the CIA was not officially permitted to kill. In the years since, each has done a great deal of both, and a military-intelligence complex has emerged to carry out the new American way of war.         O'kneel is a FUCKING LIAR...

That explains my altruism...but does it explain my autonomic nervous system?    Here's the abstract from the [original study](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nn.4035.html): "Independent evidence associates -amyloid pathology with both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep disruption and memory impairment in older adults. However, whether the influence of -amyloid pathology on hippocampus-dependent memory is, in part, driven by impairments of NREM slow wave activity (SWA) and associated overnight memory consolidation is unknown. Here we show that -amyloid burden in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) correlates significantly with the severity of impairment in NREM SWA generation. Moreover, reduced NREM SWA generation was further associated with impaired overnight memory consolidation and impoverished hippocampal-neocortical memory transformation. Furthermore, structural equation models revealed that the association between mPFC -amyloid pathology and impaired hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation was not direct, but instead statistically depended on the intermediary factor of diminished NREM SWA. By linking -amyloid pathology with impaired NREM SWA, these data implicate sleep disruption as a mechanistic pathway through which -amyloid pathology may contribute to hippocampus-dependent cognitive decline in the elderly."   http://www.docdroid.net/1293f/psychological-science-2015-miller-0956797615578476.pdf.html   I don't like when science is behind a paywall.

       Was thinking within these lines "chased by a camel, and hiding on a palm tree"                     Sorry maam. You right boob has a slower reaction development than your left. Niiiice                  sauce?      No as extreme as yours, but I laugh every time I type http://i.imgur.com/sJ4hmE6.jpg FYI sheesha is hookah   hahahahahaha YES      i thought it was all CGI in IASIF with frank, but apparently it happens!                       	28
 Actually it's pretty common for women who are independent. I'm always worried about getting laundry done, washing dishes, work, cleaning the litter, bills... Being dominated allows me to surrender control over every little thing and be free from responsibility, if only temporarily.   I would try calling, they charged you 12?   Does anyone subscribe to this? Are the boxes pretty good? I need a new box since I cancelled my birchbox    They charged me a dollar but it may be just a "hold" to see if my card is good   I was having problems signing up for it at work. Had to email them to reset my password since I somehow missed the "create an account" part.   I just signed up for their box recently (ok I wanted a free box) but have heard bad things. Do they really send out tiny foil packets regularly?   At least you didn't get a box with broken glass and hair oil all over it... lol They sent me a replacement and didn't even bother packing the hair oil better.   Not only are they messing up the boxes but now the actual full sized product orders? sigh    Has anyone tried any of the period box services? I am looking at the period store and le parcel. There are some really nice ones but I am not willing to spend $38 a month on a $9 box of tampons!! I like the idea of not having to remember to run to the store in emergencies and I am currently low on supplies, plus chocolate in the mail that week would be awesome.  Any suggestions?   Yea I think it's a verification, I'm not too worried about the $1 I just want to watch it to make sure it doesn't change to a bigger charge!    I have a "tap three times" signal to let my husband know that I need to breathe. Normally I would just use a safe word but it's hard to talk when you can't breathe lol. Just please be careful!   It may have just been a hold to see if the card was legitimate. I am not sure yet, will see if it goes away in a few days   It is a great fantasy but in reality after about two or three orgasms most people get too sensitive to continue. Is she into bdsm? There is a good website which is bondageorgasms.com You could try tying her up with a hitachi between her legs.    Uh two things. There's nothing wrong with liking certain things but you should not ever choke someone to the point of blacking out. That is not okay.  Also while there's nothing wrong with having sex on drugs, or sex while being choked, PLEASE do not combine the two. It would be a shitty way to die.   no. I like to be in control when not having sex.   Actually they charged my card $1. I emailed them to cancel, hopefully they will actually cancel my subscription   oh rainbow honey has a good base coat too, it's called all your base   seche vite is the best top coat.  as far as base coat goes I really like orly bonder   cuuuute!   oh that's not creepy at all.....   YES very Anne Hathaway. That dress is gorgeous and your figure is amazing!   I think they get positive reinforcement when other douchebags agree with them. At least I'm assuming that is encouraging them. Who the hell knows.    Tell him to shape up or ship out!      ugh and these people can get pregnant. and I can't :(   very cute!    amg I love this.   YOU'RE DOOMED   DOOOOOOOMED   horse correct battery staple   poufy things.   expired :(   worth a shot. I'm white but my hair is really frizzy and thick so I'm gonna try it too   Omg I know. once they sent me a pen!   Omg, ow. Love your bath mat!   Brags about lexus.  Refuses to pay $89/night.     Yea it's fine, ty   I got CHEESE.  Lamest box ever.  Coupon for cheese, and a lunchbag   Bob is my hero.   It's an antique collectors item!!!    Just make up one, that's what i do at work.  Sometimes we get really creative with the fake emails lol   Soup isn't really bar food....   Try to boost his confidence   They had me on the lowest possible "starter dose". Lol  I reacted badly to my levothyroxine too, they had to switch it to armour thyroid.    Well I already have a weak stomach, am lactose intolerant, etc. so it doesn't take much to send me to the bathroom lol   omg I would have slapped him and got taken off to jail   it's also supposed to help regulate hormones due to PCOS/help prevent diabetes. I cannot take it I was in the bathroom for two weeks straight. They changed it to the extended release and I was in the bathroom for another week and I switched doctors so I got someone who wouldn't make me take it lol   I have hypothyroidism as well. I'm glad you finally got a doctor that cares/listens/knows what the fuck he's doing. I had doctors who ignored my pain and insisted I take metformin for two years. I finally got an endocrinologist and an obgyn who doesn't have his head up his ass and he did a laparoscopy just to see if I had endometriosis. I didn't but they did pop some cysts while they were in there which helped a lot with the pain.     I cannot take metformin. It made me have diarrhea every day for like 2 weeks and I finally stopped taking it.   thanks!   PLEASE go no-contact with that woman. I'm so glad you are in therapy, it's pretty obvious she is the reason you need it.   Have panic attacks, can confirm.   !!! I collect cameos. So I NEED one of these cameo ones!`   for god's sake she is not obese, she is a toddler whose hands are SWOLLEN due to FIREANT BITES   I swear to god they would go out of their way to look for me on purpose. like I smell good or something   my mom got bit by bullet ants in key west and had to put meat tenderizer on it. ughhh   those things are satan    Oh thanks!  I think we do have one nearby.   My boxes are usually only 6.99, too. But when I add a non box item it seems like the shipping is almost always 15+ !!   I got the peach sake mask and loved it so I was hoping the serum would be the same stuff that was in the mask   So it's a difference in texture and when you apply it?? Do you need both? lol   to the us   It is the little sheet ones, I think the site is saying that no matter what I put in the cart :(   Ah, thanks!   paypal site won't load for me atm lol   usps   cheapest shipping option I see is $6.16   oh god I wish I could help you out as I am suffering through shark week too. Unfortunately I am also broke as shit until May 1 :(   usps   Yea it weighs a pound, according to amazon.   Lol  Well it is missing the eyeliner because honestly the eyeliner that came in it was a POS and broke. I was looking for $30 including shipping and handling.    http://imgur.com/fUWzbjh  These are from the other day, I can update them with today's date if you'd like. lol  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/iYlRafL.jpg)   it's probably the same stuff as nair, some people are allergic. I can't use it, I always break out in hives   YAY ball rash   holy cow that is adorable.   I think masturbating is a good thing UNLESS it is interfering with your sex life.   I think guys will pretty much jack off at least once a day no matter what.    My ex used to but orajel or desensitizing cream on his penis before putting on a condom. It seemed to help   That would suck because that is one of my favorite stores!   Yep!   Can someone explain the difference between a serum and an emulsion? I am looking at the skinfood peach sake. There is a toner, a serum, and an emulsion.  The serum you are supposed to use after lotion, and the emulsion you are supposed to use after toner. But I'm not sure which one to purchase. Thanks!   Can someone explain why the hell the shipping for one item is so much? I wanted to use my 5 points before they expire, so I put a tea tree mask in my cart which is $10 so the total would be $5... And then I see the shipping is almost 20 dollars!  Standard $16.58 Express $30.99   What the hell?    ahhh thanks I didn't know that! dammit I am broke too lol   In a lot of pain due to PCOS and having my period.    I had to work yesterday on Easter (I clean storage at a rental truck company) and I guess I overdid it bending over to sweep and mop, etc so today I am stuck in bed, rolling around in pain.  Horrible cramps and back pain and for some reason I am nauseous.  I recently had surgery in February and in addition to paying the obgyn $500 and the hospital $1000 I still owe the anesthesiologist $646 for a surgery that didn't even fix the extreme pain I have been suffering from for years.    I have a cracked tooth and need a root canal but the dentist will not offer a payment plan and demands all $800 up front.   I told him I cannot do this since I am already paying off the surgery I just had and ended up having to cancel the appointment.   I am going to have to find another dentist who is willing to offer a payment plan as my hours have recently been cut at work to only TWO days a week because my manager is over on payroll.    I'm trying to put off the root canal until I get the anesthesiologist bill paid off because I am not in pain (at least in my mouth) yet but I know it needs to be done.   I had an abcess on my gums which went away when I took antibiotics but the dentist said that in order to save the tooth I would need a root canal.    I don't really believe the dentist I think he just wanted to make a big bill to make money, but I can't go and get a second opinion because my insurance won't cover dental.    The good news is that since I paid my deductible I should be covered for all medical visits for the rest of the year once I pay the dentist and anesthesiologist bills.  I have three different doctors I am going to  an obgyn for PCOS, an endocrinologist for the PCOS and my thyroid problem, and a family doctor and every time I go I get a $200 bill for blood work and the obgyn does an ultrasound like once every three months.    I am really glad for my husband's job because although he doesn't get paid well he does have good insurance. There is no way we could pay all of this off if his insurance didn't cover part of it.   I am on like 5 different medications- antidepressants, birth control for my pcos, spironolactone because I have excess testosterone (due to PCOS) to help with my hairy chin and acne, a thyroid medication  and occasionally the pain gets so bad I have muscle relaxers and ultram/tramadol.   Sometimes the pain gets so bad I start crying.  They went in and got a lot of cysts out of my ovaries but I guess I just grew new ones because I was only pain free for like a month after the surgery.    Sorry for the long post but I have a lot on my mind right now. :(  Also please do not suggest I "just need to lose weight"    damn wish I'd known this BEFORE I bought the minibox   Pretty sure this is a referral...   Well he keeps being promised a raise but never actually gets it.   Wow they sounded like legit gentlemen!   well the fact that she thinks her lactose intolerant child can't eat eggs isn't a great confidence boost in her parenting abilities...   well duh, soy eggs. obviously   It would have taken all my resources not to laugh    QM: Give me a fucking quarter.  Bah, next time immediately call a manager. Or ask him to leave.    my husband has been working for this company for 10 years now. And the new hires are making .25 less per hour than he is. After 10 years of loyalty.  grrr     Well it is kind of the "old people" store...   !! I went like 3 years without a period due to pcos. I kept saying I should have bought stock in fucking pregnancy tests. Did you know they have a 6 pack?!!?!   bah my manager has been scheduling me two days a week. 16 hours. down from 24. WTF   Where is this cannon? LET ME IN THE CANNON!   "What?? I don't see where it says that on here! All I see is free!! See right here?? FREE!!"  Lol.   haha looks like I have something to look forward to!    ...because no one wants a USED DILDO.   oh god I'm so sorry. anti-depressant withdrawals are the worst thing ever   We haven't had any ashes yet, thank God.   isn't that illegal? we rent storage units and we are NOT allowed to evict/auction off the units of active duty military personnel   oh god. after one auction we had a box of baby photos and shoes. and then we saw a death certificate. we were able to get in touch with the owner, thank goodness- I wasn't going to throw out someone's dead child's shoes.   I have a lot of self-harm scars. I don't like explaining them. Thankfully most people realize exactly what they are and don't ask.   um no, I'm pretty sure people like it when you compliment/ask them about their tattoos.  	104
                I think what you say is fair comment, but if you think back to the commentary of those races there was always a clear separation between the teams shod by one manufacturer. The problem that led to Michelin leaving was that they were getting bad PR for always being worse than the other supplier.   With cost controls come limitations - it really is that simple.   Any team will argue in a meeting that x rule is fine so long a we outlaw x behavior because that will drive costs. I do also think that newer fans tend to believe historic grand prix had less rules and were therefore purer - that isn't necessarily the case.   As I said nine hours ago:  Based on what you had to say there is no point in disagreeing with you - there isn't anything anyone could say to you that would deter you from these uninformed talking points.  And so it has proved to be true.    I did address your points in my first reply to your comment, the rest has just been you blustering along trying to pretend that you didn't lose the argument first time out. The links you've add here are not verifiable data - they prove nothing of what you originally stated.  To paraphrase a famous winner 'please proceed Mr DevilishRogue'   We tried it during the tyre war. Essentially one manufacturer's gets it right, the other doesn't, and any team using the latter's tyres suffers badly. Basically it ruins the racing and leads to nonsense like the [2005 US Grand Prix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_tyres#2005_United_States_Grand_Prix_controversy)   Basically, robbed of the DM and the DT you can't substantiate any of your claims with actual facts.   There is a reason for that.   No. What I've provided to you is facts and examples backed up by verifiable data and foundational economic principles that are known and used for decision making worldwide.  What you have provided is fact free bluster, the usual kiptard whining because your opinion isn't demonstrable fact, the world doesn't work like you think it should, and your corporate welfare ridden bibles the DM and the DT can't be used to substantiate the price of fish.   Still fact free blustering I see.  Typical DM reader.    It doesn't matter - graduates will still earn more money through their lifetimes than those with a lower qualification. The average graduate salary is 31,041 compared to 17,899 for non-graduates even if they are working in non-graduate jobs.  The number of official graduate places in the workforce is not an argument against obtaining a degree level education.   Once you look at [the productivity numbers](http://static.squarespace.com/static/541ff5f5e4b02b7c37f31ed6/5429942de4b0455e57050a1b/542994cde4b0455e57053198/1412011213400/Measures-of-productivity-2-2003-12.png?format=original) its quite clear when productivity fell.   Young people tend to be hit hardest by a recession and recruitment for that generation never returns, hence the 'lost generation' of the 90's and 2008.   But we're also in the bottom three countries in the OECD rankings, our oldest workers have better and more marketable skills than our youngest, and the fault there is the fall in university places combined with the rise in the cost of education. Both of these factors are a drag on productivity.                  No worries!   She's been an Assembly Member for 16 years, and just announced she's standing down. So I suspect she might offer a highly informed perspective on the coming campaign.   Might be also be useful to see if Val Shawcross would be up for an AMA, we and the AM candidates might learn a thing or two.   The number of Graduate positions is immaterial to the benefits to the individual and the wider economy of obtaining a degree.  95% of all degree graduates get a job, the average graduate salary is 31,041 compared to 17,899 for non-graduates even if they are working in non-graduate jobs.   Salaries for every kind of education below degree, including the vocational courses and apprenticeships are much lower [Source](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-333261).  Even the much hated on 'Media Studies' has a 93% employment rate, second only to medicine - that's a better figure than Engineering or Architecture graduates.  Biased nonsense from the DM or DT isn't proof of anything, examine the actual data for yourself without the righty spin. Consider also that just because you had this experience in the employment market, not everyone else does.     Thanks! I was only aware of three of them before I got this email, a surprisingly wide field   Still with the factless quoted blustering I see.  Your opinion on education policy is simply wrong. The current government's own figures show that to be the case as does the experience of every other developed country on the planet. Degree education is the path to growth and improvement in living standards.  The target of your ire, media studies, actually has the second best employment prospects in the country but you still can't admit you're wrong.   As I said there is no point in disagreeing with you - the reason a bunch of people downvoted you without replying is that no one wanted to be bothered with this whole quoted nonsense.  In any case, I provided a well argued refutation of your original points, and you've not managed to provide anything substantial in response but blustery factless nonsense.  Incidentally in 2013 among those who completed their course Media Studies has a 93% employment rate, second only to medicine.   95% of all degree graduates get a job, the average graduate salary is 31,041 compared to 17,899 for non-graduates even if they are working in non-graduate jobs. Salaries for every kind of education below degree, including the vocational courses you reccomend are much lower [Source](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-333261).  See, that's a source, not the biased claptrap trotted out by the DM and DT.  By the way, you complained of being downvoted but are still downvoting me because you disagree with what I have to say.     The point is that despite knowing nothing at all about any of these departments actually do you assume these talking points are true because pavlov style you've been trained to believe that and trot out the DM style responses. The sheer ignorance of all of your comments above show that to be true.  Also you can reply to a comment without quoting every single line of it.    You think there are a limited number of graduate jobs because that's the only metric you're looking at. The present decline in those positions is mainly down to the long term effect of 2008 and the increase in unpaid or low paid internships for those leaving education - most of these positions are being funded by the benefits system.  Degree education improves your *lifetime* earning power - not just the few years after you leave university. It doesn't matter if you get a graduate job or not you still earn more from the moment you hit the employment market.     London Assembly selections:  Following the recent announcement by long serving London Assembly Member Val Shawcross [of her retirement], it has been decided to extend the application period by a further week.

Donations can be made online at https://donate.labour.org.uk/london/1 or by post to London Labour Party, Walkden House, Melton Street, NW1 2EB, Thank you.   Its looking more and more like the IDS/Hague/Howard period where the Tories kept electing ideologically pure candidates because it didn't recognise that electorate had changed.    I think they expected a Tory minority government. When you examine the changes they made in the fixed term parliament act - removing dissolution of parliament for a defeated queens speech, defeated major legislation and the like they clearly had in mind the problems faced by the Major government.   Based on what you had to say there is no point in disagreeing with you - there isn't anything anyone could say to you that would deter you from these uninformed talking points.  To be brief:   Lower educational numbers are a drag on productivity, even Osborne recognises this. Courses that you apparently don't consider valid (possibly because your interest is in dismissing the label rather than understanding the course) result in higher earnings and higher economic productivity in the long term - this directly affects GDP and the nature of the courses doesn't actually matter, its the level of study alone that works.  The same is true in employment related courses - the Farage favorite of stable hand qualifications and hairdressing courses. These improve wages and enable employment mobility i.e. if you can demonstrate your experience on paper you stand a much better chance of getting a better job with better pay. FYI a qualified salon colourist able to mix their own dyes earns 90 per hour, the reason it's a BSc course and not a BA is that a substantial part of a colourists job is chemistry.  The bloated middle management talking point is simply nonsense when discussing an organisation with 1.6 million staff. Small numbers of senior management can't possibly make decisions with enough focus to run an organisation on that scale without middle management - the same is true in any large private sector organisation. The example you cite '5 a day coordinator' may seem silly to you but the organisational role is about improving preventative healthcare and education i.e. saving money before it's spent.  International aid is 10 billion in a 700 billion budget. This is a talking point because some people don't like who its spent on and lack the wit to understand why it's spent and what benefit the country derives from it. For example, DFID was a major donor to the LUBILOSA Programme which developed a biological pesticide for locust control in Sahel zone across Africa. This developed a commercial product in conjunction with British scientists (which provided funding to British Universities) and was commercialised as a product by British and French companies. So this one programme created jobs in the UK, provided jobs and experience for graduate scientists, improved the agricultural output of a swath of Africa (which assists in famine prevention and thereby reduces emergency aid in the long term), and resulted in British and French companies creating lasting partnerships.  I appreciate that these things seem daft to you, but the fault lies in your understanding of what's happening and it's outputs, not the way the money is being spent. Perhaps look at the world through another lens rather than DT/DM headlines.                  Both men seem to have gained an appreciation for what their collective hubris cost them in 2007.   Ron lost control of the team that represents his life's work, Alonso lost a guaranteed shot at four further WDC's, and results that were at least as good as Ferrari's, potentially better with him in the car.  So I suspect that, older and wiser, they really have set aside their differences because they both need each other very badly indeed. Neither has any other move left.      He isn't wrong, apparently fear of a functioning democracy in Scotland is a major driver for English voters, which is simply sad.  The problem amongst the LibDem's appears to be that the parliamentary party views the coalition as a heroic effort to save the country from a minority government whereas their voters simply view them as traitors.   When the Libs lost 25% of their membership post the tuition fees fiasco, or when they were annihilated in the council elections two years ago you'd have thought they would have reversed course and thought about their supporters - apparently not - equally apparently the parliamentary party don't seem to have changed their view of the coalition since the election.   The weight and number of the fuel rigs that have to be moved around. The fuel is mostly shipped by their fuel suppliers.   Yesterday was the day when everyone officially announced their candidacy. I'd have preferred an email with some more information, but completely understand the approach.   Yep. Also an email from Tessa Jowell. I'll be supporting the Tessa - more info [here](http://www.tessa.london/). I like Sadiq but I'd rather see him in the Shadow Justice Secretary role.      Vettel gets [33.7 million in the first season](http://www.totalsportek.com/f1/sebastian-vettel-ferrari-contract-worth-240-million/) but much less in the following two, Alonso is apparently on [25 million a season](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/jenson-button/11288225/Jenson-Buttons-salary-slashed-but-McLaren-driver-is-raring-to-fight-for-world-title-again.html)      Whatever billionaire you're talking about according to the press, especially the MOS, they're corrupt.   Most of the people complaining, just as you are, are sore because they were on the wrong end of a deal and didn't get what they wanted or what they thought they were due. Thems the breaks. Ultimately you have no proof of anything merely a bunch of tabloid gossip and the usual heroes and villains narrative.   Refueling rigs are expensive to buy, you need a team of four additional people to maintain and operate them during the race, further people on the FIA end to inspect them, people to pack them up, more people back at base to optimise the fuel delivery, additional vehicles to transport them to and from the airport or seaport, and the air and sea freight is expensive.  The teams, according to RBR, have five versions of their race setup on the ocean or in the air at any one time. So its not just one rig you need to buy five. They also have two versions of their pit crew so thats at least eight additional staff to hire, transport and accomodate.  There is also additional work, parts, and maintenance on the cars to consider, and more work for the team's own safety officers.  In any form of business staff are always the most expensive component.          Heroes and Villains mate. Everyone else is always the innocent hero in F1 deal and Bernie is always the evil villain. Funny thing is the world generally doesn't operate that way.   You're claiming Bernie wanted a bribe, that sounds terribly corrupt, when in fact was he was offering was a deal to stage a race.  Grands Prix are mostly run on 10 year contracts, so offering a resign at the 8 year stage is pretty reasonable especially if the commercial environment has changed - in the case of Adelaide the transport fees had increased steeply thanks to the oil market. So, as **you** said, they were offered a deal, dithered over it, and lost the GP and lost as a result.   Basically in F1 the manufacturers pay for the racing and form the basis of the grid. They subsidised 50% of the cost of the engines in the V8 formula, and they're still heavily subsidising the cost now. Without the manufacturers the sport simply wouldn't exist. The foundation of the current Formula was laid the day BMW exited saying this:  Premium [brands] will increasingly be defined in terms of sustainability and environmental compatibility. This is an area in which we want to remain in the lead. In line with our Strategy Number ONE, we are continually reviewing all projects and initiatives to check them for future viability and sustainability. Our Formula One campaign is thus less a key promoter for us - Norbert Reithofer  In other words the sports strategy needed to change, particularly in the light of the global recession, in order to keep the manufacturers we did have and hopefully attract new ones.   You can find all of those things in other series - IMO it sounds like you'd enjoy Indy more than F1.   I see - in your mind 'race fee' is equal to a 'bribe'. Got it.  FOM pays for all the safety work, FIA oversight, stewards, medical staff, transport and shipping, hotels, basically the cost of getting the personnel and the show to the venue and back. But mainly 60% of its revenue forms the prize money the teams get - so when you support a team calling for more money you also support increasing the race fee.  In short Melbourne outbid Adelaide. By your own admission they were offered a deal to resign but dithered over it and Bernie went to Melbourne who wanted the race more. Business is business.   In other words Adelaide couldn't make up its mind about the level of support and lost the race - how does this constitute Bernie taking a bribe?   No matter what room he's in Galloway is always the biggest cunt in it.   He brokers the deals, and he's pretty bloody good at it. No one would have F1 without him, and F1 will miss him very much when he's gone, its just going to take a while for people to realise that.   He made it, he gets to do mostly what he wants with it, and for the most part he's looked after his bit it pretty well.   Personally all I see is a bunch of armchair quarterbacks who have little idea about the realities being faced crying because they didn't get the rules mix they thought would solve all of their issues. I've listened to it for nearly four decades, and no matter what solution is offered someone is always sore, someone else claims it isn't proper racing, and it'll all be Bernie's fault no matter who made the decision or what governing structures were in place.   But really this whole thing is about rich teams, rich manufacturer's, rich team owners and slightly richer business people making a deal where everyone gets a bit of what they wanted.  Big business is corrupt full stop, its less corrupt than it used to be, but it just is and saying you want one rich guy to die isn't really changing anything is it?  What will Bernie's death change anyway? FOM doesn't dictate the rules, Bernie rarely gets everything he wants (which if you listen to the details is often more in touch with what the fans want than the teams). Bernie will be replaced and things will carry on.    Neither of those teams had a $1 billion dollar business supporting the them, and neither of those teams had a Ferrari engine, parts, and support. Looking at how competitive Sauber have been so far this season I don't think they're stretching the truth.   Why on earth would you wish for someone's death just because you disagree with them?   Because we'd like to have engines made by people with expertise in cutting edge engine technology rather than some 30 year old design cobbled together because it sounds good and the bhp meets the arbitrary expectations of large number fetishists          I think Mercedes new safety car includes concepts from the W05 engine?   The 2002 Arrows A23 chassis carried on through two further teams and was racing again in 2006. Stoddart discarded it after buying the IP, and from there it went to SuperAguri.  I don't have a problem with the customer car effort. It's hard getting a team established financially and anything that can bring in teams, and allow them the financial space to get going and develop, will help the sport in the long term.    /u/trollabot         The sporting rules contain a list of parts that must be produced in house - the list exists to prevent customer cars.            I'm not disagreeing your statement about the individual cars - the elements of the coke bottle design were evident throughout the late 70s and early 80s grid in their evolutionary forms. But the MP4/4 and 4/5 along with the 640 really kicked off the shape of the cars to come, and spread the design downgrid.         Done.      Hulkenberg had the most consistent junior career, but his results are only comparable with Hamilton's at 5 championships each. I beleive Hamilton remains one of the very few drivers to have won every series he's entered.   By junior championship win's:   Grosjean (7), Hamilton (5), Hulkenberg (5), Massa (4), Alonso (3), Bottas (3), Nasr (3), Maldonado (3), Ricciardo (2), Raikkonen (2), Sainz (2), Kvyat (2), Rosberg (2), Ericsson (2), Button (2), Magnussen (2), Vettel (1), Verstappen (1), Prez (1), Merhi (1), Stevens (0).  For comparison Schumacher had 3 junior championships.  Availability of race seats matters though - Raikkonen, Verstappen, and Vettel barely competed in the junior categories. Its not a hard and fast rule, but RBR drivers tend to have shorter junior carrers because RBR have 4 seats in F1 and promote/discard quickly.   Schumacher won 3 junior championships, as did Alonso, which is only one championship adrift of Nico Rosberg(2) and Nasr (2) for comparison's sake. Hamilton and Hulkenberg, by contrast, won 5 championships each.    The 6 month leadership election fight in 2010 allowed Cameron and Osborne the space, assisted by Liam Byrne's idiotic letter, to define the recession as local rather than global.   A public keen for someone to blame lapped up the message as it played into the general air of incompetence that had built up around Brown.   It remains to be seen if the current leadership cycle will allow the Tories to define us again, but the large number of candidates isn't helping.         Sure. I'm not disagreeing with your statement about the individual cars - the elements of the coke bottle design were evident throughout the late 70s and early 80s grid in their evolutionary form. But the MP4/4 and 4/5 along with the 640 really kicked off the shape of the cars to come, and spread the design downgrid.   Yep, and with better production values.   True, but neither are entirely recognisable as a modern F1 car, and not everybody went that way. McLaren and Ferrari got it right in 88/89 and then everyone else followed suit - hence my title.   In the overwhelming majority of theatres profit isn't a consideration at all.   The only way most shows get staged is through fund raising, the arts council, or other charities. Profit left the building 30 years ago.   Speaking as a former Theatre pro, there isn't really a problem with the industry. People outside the major cities, especially young people, simply stopped going to the theatre for fun in large enough numbers for it to be sustainable. In an environment where there is so much competition for the entertainment  rep theatre simply lost (so did pubs and the music industry, but that's another story).  Rising costs to the public in terms of tickets, transport, food and drink, obviously didn't help. The fact that the sheer effort involved in organising an evening out increased as working hours lengthened is also a factor, as is parents keeping teens on a tighter leash. But the reality is you can stick a good HBO show on your HD TV, or download a good movie for 4 and be just as entertained as going out to the theatre without any hassle. In fact you can be *reliably* entertained, and the same can't be said for rep theatre.  The result is virtually the only shows that are sustainable are large scale musicals, pantomimes, and new writing (things you can't watch on the TV at home). That being the case basically all the rep theatres are closing or merging and all that remains are regional receiving houses and even those are under threat.  People do love the idea of the theatre, they simply don't go it and then act unhappy when the local theatres close. Theatre seems to be entertainment for *other* people.   Scottish union members are almost certainly going to leave Labour for the SNP this year, particularly as we're going to get wiped out in the Scottish parliamentary elections - we've had a declining vote share up there since 2003 - something the English party has simply ignored.      Its easy to be cynical about this, but the electorate has apparently changed significantly which is why the pollster's models didn't work.  The [election results show](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/9418) that Labour areas became more polarized and the same thing happened in Conservative areas. Previously Liberal areas went Blue en masse, and the downward Labour trend in Scotland since 2003 accelerated massively.   It's going to be fascinating finding out what exactly has changed and the drivers behind it.      It is of course, but electric cars powered by self generation or mains electricity are far cleaner because the emissions can be effectively controlled and the generation type includes a far stronger renewable component.    He's facing a political reality where there are two main right wing parties in England that hate him and one main left wing party that merely dislikes him quite a bit.   So I suspect comments like this are, as you say, him trying to appear relevant to his members.  All that said, he isn't wrong in what he said, and the fault lies in the failure of the party to bring the Unions with it as it progressed over the last 50 years. Something that's simply resulted in the Unions becoming more and more extremist as the party has moderated.   The point being that engine costs were going to increase substantially when the cost cap arrangement ended in any case.   Most fan argument places the V8 cost at 8 million, ignores the subsidisation and its impending end, and argues the cost of the new engines is 20 million (which is still a subsidised cost) is too high and the increase too great for the non-works teams to bear. In reality the V6 formula is only a small amount more expensive than the V8 formula would have been without Mosley's cost cap.  Essentially the fan argument contends one group of rich people (the teams) is more deserving of cost reduction than another group of rich people (the manufacturers) and expects the latter to pick up the tab for the former, whilst conveniently ignoring the fact that they have been paying for the sport's existence for a long time.   The wider point is that the manufacturers and teams do not make a profit from being in F1 directly - it's a marketing platform for virtually everyone except Sauber and Manor. Every successful outfit has a strong underlying business, all of the so called 'minnows' do not, and it's telling that Williams resurgence is closely aligned with its development of a technology business.  Of the 137 official F1 constructors that participated since 1950 only 10 remain active - costs and rules were a problem in 1950, and they remain a problem today. Realistically the sport needs to look hard at what is and isn't a successful business model for a team when it considers new entrants.       It was an FIA led deal negotiated by Mosley. F1 got cost capped engines, the manufacturers were allowed to supply more teams.  Google FIA Mosley Cost Cap if you'd like to know more, although this is being discussed elsewhere in the thread.   In effect they subsidise the sport. They make back from the sport about half of what they spend on being in it. F1 is a marketing platform for them.      F1 teams were, and still are, receiving subsidised engines and the v8 version of that deal expired. The v8s actual cost was around 16 million as season, but the teams got the engines for 8 million. So the terms of cost reduction in much of the fan argument are very relativistic.   It really depends what new technology eliminates when you want to claim something is dirty vs something else. Hydrogen, for example, is extraordinarily inefficient when compared to batteries [here's Elon Musk explaining why](https://youtu.be/Y_e7rA4fBAo?t=10m21s).   Between Tesla and Apple battery technology has improved dramatically in just 8 years.  Home batteries that can charge overnight and power the home during the day have arrived. This reduces demand, which eliminates power stations, and makes them cleaner than the current solution.   Every car manufacturer has gone hybrid, and cars will be mainly electrically powered within the decade. That eliminates not only fossil fuels, but the transport systems that support its delivery, and the environmental damage caused by its discovery, refining and extraction. Because of this batteries are actually cleaner than current solutions.   The ignorance displayed by some fans over the v6 engine move, noise issue and fuel saving is quite simply astonishing.           Labour led four Lab/Lib coalitions in the Scottish Parliament, each garnering less and less support until the 2007 wipeout. Of the 73 constituencies in Scotland, only 20 are now represented parties other than the SNP. Labour had to rely on regional lists to get its seats the last time around.  The evidence suggests that trend will continue in 2016.   IMO you're completely right, it would have been had we had the sense to send some of our best back to Scotland or keep them there in the first place. Sadly Westminster was always the priority.    Its very easy to say that, particularly with justifiable disdain for the other political parties involved. But members in Scotland quite rightly ask what did our support for those MP's and Prime Minister's deliver *for* Scotland - I hear the same questions asked in the North of England. I can't point to anything, can you?  I chuckle a little as I hear the millennial generation criticised for being selfish and self absorbed by a generation that bought them up that way, it throws the 'small britain' politics of the day into sharp relief. Everyone seems deeply concerned that someone else is getting something they're not. No one believes their voices are being heard or their issues attended to, I don't see the party offering a solution to that narrative as the different wings sharpen their sticks for the leadership election, merely playing to it.   While I have every respect for Murphy and the work he's done, it would have been better effected two or three years ago, perhaps 20 years ago.   One has to ask what the Scottish contingent of Labour MP's were working on for the last few years that was more important than working *in* Scotland?   If the truth is (as I suspect) that the leadership and the Scottish contingent did not realise the work was necessary until halfway through indyref, then we deserve what happened north of the border.   In 1996, around four hours after registering at uni in Edinburgh, I found myself listening to Alex Salmond speak. All of the main parties had been invited to student hustings to encourage party registration but only Salmond turned up.  Already being a Labour member (grandson of trade unionists, I had a lifetime membership three months after conception) I was campaigning for the devolution referendum a year later. What I found was quite shocking. The branches barely met, had no policy ideas, and mainly operated as a poorly attended social club.   On the doorstep allegations of 'red tory' were common and you would really struggle to disagree with them - the elite of Scotland were all Labour voters and had no interest dealing with the extraordinary poverty on the sink estates surrounding the major cities or the complexities of life in remote communities.  By 1999 Dewar had returned from Westminster to lead the Scottish Assembly. He was a popular figure, but many in the party struggled with the fact that he had left Scotland for career, like so many other young people, and was only now returning for a coronation. Just like Murphy, Cook, Brown, Darling, the list is endless.  Listening to a friend who had gone to Scotland for the independence campaign describe the state of the party in Scotland it was clear to me nothing had changed. The leadership could best be described as the 'z' team, many in the party supported independence, the branches remained social clubs, and the members were disengaged from a campaign that had nothing to offer *for* Scotland but 'their figures are wrong', 'don't do something you'll regret'.  Alex Salmond wanted the referendum date, Cameron wanted straight Yes or No, Labour wanted DevoMax. Salmond and Cameron did a deal and placed Labour in a trap, and we walked straight into it without a second thought.   Neither Unionist party could present a positive vision for Scotland via a new Scotland Act so Darling waged an entirely negative campaign fighting for the status quo with vague promises of a new settlement after 2015. Communities were divided, friends and families stopped speaking to each other - a deep anger bubbled to the surface. Quite obviously the 'victory' was pyrrhic - literally bonfire of the vanities.  Parachuting in Murphy at the last minute with nothing new to offer was just more of the same garbage that Scottish voters had been hearing for the last half century and I'm not at all surprised it didn't work.  If Labour wants its voice heard in Scotland again it needs to be a voice *from* Scotland speaking to England fighting for Scottish issues and not the other way around. We need a strong Scottish Labour party that believes in the union and can say in a single sentence why the union is worthwhile. The exact same thing is true in Wales. If we can't provide those voices then independence should happen now.      Farage was attempting a similar stunt to the Labour 'stone' when the crash happened - flying a plane with a banner on it in an attempt to get free media coverage.   Lets just say that the stunt exceeded expectations.      Probably why Farage crashed his plane!   If you want to get a party message into a print media that will only print negative stories about your campaign, then something like this works very well indeed. The press print the photo with the message intact and it's free media from there on.   Whomever you're opposing doesn't matter, because the people open to the message, in this case 'promises set in stone' unlike the current government, will get it.   This is a media trick designed to deal with overwhelming negative coverage in the media.   Basically Labour couldn't get any positive message into the print media, so it tried the immigration mug. All of the press printed the photo of the mug complete with the 'strong on immigration' message, and from that point on the tone of the story didn't matter, the voters read the message.  The stone was a step too far, but again the media printed the picture with the messages on it intact. Had Labour won it would have been quite a clever way of getting 'promises set in stone', which is a wedge issue with certain voter groupings, into wide circulation.  Likely an Axelrod idea - think the Obama 'hope' poster - which worked very well in the states. The Tories did it in 2010 election with the DC posters and UKIP at the EU election with their posters - left media exploded and they got a ton of free media from their ad buy.   Too damaged (and damageable still) by association with her husband, too last 10 years to be useful in an election. Essentially a more of the same thing you've seen under Miliband and Brown, but with a more acceptable face candidate.  We need to break away from the past, and another former minister who is easy to paint with the woes of the party won't help.         I suspect the reason that Tessa Jowell stood down might be is that she intends to run for the Mayoralty.   The electoral landscape shifted against the party in an extremely difficult to surmount way - we would now need 13% swing to get a majority, the Tories only need 6%.   The electoral system was tilted against the Tories through the last couple of decades because Labour and LibDem supporters in marginals were prepared to vote tactically to keep the Tories out, and many LibDem seats were Lib/Con marginals with the Tories in second place. All of that is over.  We lost votes to the Tories in former Liberal seats, to the Greens everywhere, and notably the SNP in Scotland. Liberal votes went Conservative en masse, and the remainder to the Greens. UKIP hurt us rather than the Tories, because we lost votes to them and their vote turned out to be softer than expected allowing the Tories to win. The Labour vote is being squeezed at the top, bottom, and middle.  In Conservative seats we needed to win there was a swing *to* the Tories, and in seats we already held there was a swing *to Labour* - we got piles of votes where we didn't need them and lost votes where we did.   Apparently the 'letter' is missing, so he didn't meet the requirements of the party's constitution.   My working assumption is that Carswell was being looked to as a future leader in order to divide the work involved but turned out to be a pain in the backside - just as he was in the Conservative party.   Zero chance of the Tories putting up a big beast for London Mayor after the last two rounds of local/national elections - 45 Labour seats vs 27 Conservative ones.  Anyone standing on the blue team will essentially be a sacrificial lamb.   He's very close to Tessa Jowell, she stood down from Parliament with the Mayoralty in mind, so I very much doubt he would cut across one of his political mentor's plans.      Hello fellow Streathamite.   More to come on this I suspect. Seems a very left field decision for someone who was selected for leadership potential.   Those rumours have been around since he stood - mainly fueled by certain streatham lib dems during the 2010 election. Mostly seem to be driven by the absent girlfriend.                        I like EJ because he provides experience and an informal style that's absent in the Sky team, I think DC was shaping up to be a great foil for Brundle before the Sky move.  I watch Sky for the 'grown up' Brundle commentary and Kravitz's notebook, but it's a bit of a sausage party, Crofty and Lazenby really getting on my nerves, and only Kravitz, Hill, and Herbert actually look comfortable on camera.  I wish they would let Hill provide more insight and stop playing up the Herbert/Hill comedy duo.   Isn't this the reason that Mclaren, Williams, and Mercedes (and some others) have fins on their sidepods?   He had a very hard race, he told the sky commentators that the water system wasn't functioning on top of all of the other problems so he would have been extremely dehydrated at the end of the race.   Basically every time he hit the throttle, no matter how much, the back snapped out.   Of course they're going to say positive things, that's how the world works. Had the been more realistic people would just piss on them. They have made positive gains, they just haven't hit the points yet, but it'll come.   People in this sub seem to expect miracles from McLaren, and I don't know why! It takes about 3 years to develop an F1 engine, Honda have had one year and 5 test races.  In terms of on track performance they've gone from 5 seconds of the lead to around 1.6 seconds since the start of the season - which is a huge leap! So they've made a lot of progress, but still have a long way to go.   I really don't know why everyone is so disappointed.   Most of the aero effort seems to be going into the front and rear wings!                  I agree. As I said, because the fuel sensors are relatively new and so is the analysis of their data, I suspect that the FIA are seeing information that can't be easily explained and this has lead to some suspicions and the improvement in the rules governing the fuel system.   The scrutineers had the opportunity to go over all of the cars thoroughly (because of the test) and found nothing of concern. Since there is no name attached to the complaint, at least publicly, I suspect that it's just concern over unexplained data rather than the teams doing something to get around the rules.    Yes, after Alonso's emails had ended up in Bernie's inbox, from where they made their way to the FIA. This is what prompted the second formal investigation and the very pointed request for the driver's information.  On the 2nd of November Alonso announced he was departing McLaren, just 5 days later Renault are charged with possessing McLaren's confidential information, a charge on which they were found guilty.  Who ran Renault? Briatore. Who's Alonso's manager? Briatore.   You do the math.  By September of the following year Briatore and Alonso were fixing races.   Absolutely, it was all a made up conspiracy to deny Alonso his third WDC. Nothing to do with Alonso's behavior and *regal* expectations.  /sarcasm   Awful news   I see Alonso derangement syndrome is alive and well.  You believe whatever you want to. I'll believe actual facts and the legal records of the hearings that were published by the World Motorsport Council.  Yes the FIA employed and independent scrutineer [at Alonso's request], because Alonso tried to blackmail his way to a WDC got the team fined which put jobs at risk back home, and then expected the engineering staff to treat him normally afterwards.   Emails which Alonso then sent to Bernie, and Bernie sent to the FIA. This is a matter of record in a hearing at the World Motorsport council - these are facts and not in any form of dispute.  Also, your attempt to correlate the dispute in qualification and turn it into a blackmail situation has no basis in reality, and has no proof backing it whatsoever.  Again this is a matter of legal record in the World Motorsport Council and is not in dispute. The row occurred in Ron Dennis's motorhome at the race, and happened because Alonso held up Hamilton.    No, I mean to say that his holding Hamilton up on track thereby ruining his quali, and then when confronted over it, his threat to Dennis to ruin the team's season and McLaren's reputation unless his demands were accommodated show that he's a bad guy - or a least he was at the time.  Strange also that Renault somehow came into possession of detailed technical specs of McLaren's 2006 and 2007 cars later in the season. I wonder how that happened.   You're thinking of the first case which was settled on 26 July 2007 and resulted in no penalty for McLaren (Mosley was unsuccessful).  I'm referring to the second case was heard on 13 September 2007 and was entirely built on the Alonso/De La Rosa/Coughlan emails.  Somehow Alonso's emails had been sent to Bernie, and somehow or other Renault had also obtained extensive technical information on the 2007 McLaren car. I wonder how that happened.   Not the case at all.   There was no proof that the information had been used until Alonso forced Ron's hand. The damning evidence were the emails between De La Rosa and Alonso as these proved the information was beneficial to the team.   No. Ron Dennis was doing that in the early 80s, most famously with Prost and Senna - Many years before Merc were even a modern F1 team. Its one of the most famous things about the team.  In fact, given the McLaren/Mercedes history together, there is a very decent argument that Mercedes modelled their team operation on McLaren and this was the nature of the dispute between Brawn and Lauda/Wolff and Lowe. Brawn being a famous team orders man.   Alonso wasn't whistleblowing.   The emails Alonso was threatening to turn over were those exchanged between himself Coughlan and Pedro De La Rosa actually using the Ferrari information between themselves. What he wanted in return for not revealing them was number one status. Dennis refused to be blackmailed and turned the team into the FIA himself.   Until that point McLaren's story had been that they received the information, but no one actually used it (at least there was no proof that was the case). Since Alonso and De La Rosa had actually used it, and Alonso could prove it from his own email account, that's what blew the case open again.   The assertions that Dennis treated Hamilton better than Alonso are basically nonsense - Dennis has a very long history of letting his drivers race fairly whereas Alonso was expecting number one status - his treatment after the row with Ron over Spygate was completely understandable as he had basically pissed all over the team and no one at any level of the organisation could tolerate that.  Lets not forget here that Hamilton turned in the best rookie season the sport has ever seen, frequently beating an experienced double world champion with 6 more seasons of F1 experience. Without the team's tyre mistake at the Chinese Grand Prix, he would have won the WDC in his rookie season.   No problem.   http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/35hwqn/alonso_brake_failure_caused_by_visor_tear_off/   Didn't help himself?   He couldn't cope with being challenged by a rookie so tried to blackmail Ron Dennis, which led to McLaren being disqualified and fined $100 million.   The only reason he wasn't at least disqualified from that years championship or worse (it was he and De La Rose sharing the data) was that he gave evidence against McLaren for immunity.   What's funny, when you've been watching the sport for several decades, is reading these comments and remembering that's what was being said about the likes of Prost, Senna, Schumacher and Mansell during their careers.   Like Alonso and Piquet, Prost was his own worst enemy.   Its one of those 'letter vs the spirit of the rules' situations (if it's actually happening at all). From what I can gather of the camera pods, the were only a couple of millimetres larger than the rules required.  But that's F1, complain about good ideas first and then duplicate them later.   I don't have any emotional investment in Nasr, but I have been impressed by his and Sainz potential. I also think, thanks to Maldonado and a lot of people who don't really understand how the sport works, the label 'pay driver' is being thrown around in a very ignorant fashion at the moment.   Nasr got sponsorship because he's Brazilian *and* good, not because he happened to be the only Brazilian in F1.  As I've pointed out elsewhere, it was Fittipaldi that bought Philip Morris to McLaren, and Alonso who bought in Santander.   Good point, I failed to filter out Keke, so Nico has 16 and Keke has 3.   At the junior stage of his career it makes his results better than Rosberg's at the same stage, which is what I said.   No, but I'm not surprised it wasn't mentioned, without a name of the complainant attached such things haven't been mentioned in the past.   I don't know if one or more teams has complained, or something the stewards have seen in an engine has made them suspicious - I would suspect the latter. They timed the announcement well, since everyone is hanging around in Spain for the test it gave them the opportunity to have a really thorough look at the cars.   Fittipaldi bought his personal sponsors Philip Morris to McLaren, Alonso bought his personal sponsors Santander to McLaren and Ferrari, both left the sponsors behind when they left.   *Everyone* is a pay driver at some stage. Gaining sponsors is a competitive advantage in getting an F1 seat, when moving teams, and in paying for a junior career. Even for drivers in a junior programme.  If the debate is that results matter, Nasr has the results.      It looks radical for sure, but the fundamental that led to this design is still dealt with in the modern era with less obvious imagination, but imagination non-the-less.  It's not the only six wheeled F1 car, but it is the only one to race - there's the [March 2-4-0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2-4-0), [Ferrari 312T6](http://s183.photobucket.com/user/Starcowboy/media/Enzo/312t2-6a.jpg.html), and even a Williams. Ferrari even tried an eight wheeled version of the [312T6](http://pixgood.com/ferrari-312t6.html)  Funnily enough the reasoning behind the 6 wheels was dealing with dirty air better to reduce drag, these days we do that through the complicated front wings.   Nasr. He has two junior championships a 2nd and two 3rds under his belt - those are better junior results than Rosberg (2 championships and one 2nd), and only one junior championship adrift of Schumacher (3 championships, one 2nd, one 3rd) at the same stage of his career. Yet he's branded a pay driver.   In which case it doesn't make sense that Fangio still holds so many records, compared to Jackie Stewart who entered 48 more races than he did.  Equally Hamilton holds more records than Senna, even though as of last week, he has entered 152 grand prix compared to Senna's 162. In this case Hamilton and Senna can be directly compared and Hamilton wins that particular contest.  Fangio competed in 52 races over and eight year career winning 46.15% of all the races he entered - no modern era driver can hope to come close to that, so the bias you refer to has a reverse. The result is that many of the records Fangio holds like oldest driver to enter, highest win percentage, cannot be broken in the modern era. Likewise there are some modern records, that Fangio couldn't get near - total laps led, number of consecutive entries.  Finally, if 'chances' mattered then Barrichello, having entered 326 races should hold more records than anyone else, but he only has 19, Alonso should also hold many more records than Hamilton having entered 240 races.  What's really interesting though is that if you knock out the percentage stats, and records that couldn't be broken in the modern era Hamilton is the second best driver ever behind Vettel, because Schumacher holds a lot of records simply through the longevity of his career - which is also a record.   I suspect a lot of that is down to Briatore's influence on the young Alonso.   In terms of the total number of F1 driver records held, the only people ahead of Hamilton (52) are Schumacher (97) and Vettel (72).   He's already eclipsed Clark (36), Senna (37), Lauda (16), Prost (42), Mansell (29), Stewart (14), Fangio (37), Ascari (20), Hill (5), Hkkinen (17), Alonso (46), N. Rosberg (16) and many more.   He's also the only active driver increasing his count of records at the moment - adding 4 in 2014, Vettel was down 5 in the same period.  Statistically at least Hamilton is the third best driver in F1 history.   Yep, they were conservative and didn't want to risk the position. I understand the reasons and from a team point of view they make sense, from a racing point of view they don't.    Spotting the parking manoeuvre (the drivers can't see the nose), and watching for un-noticed problems.   For much of the 94' pre-season and virtually the whole of the season teams were concerned about safety because active suspension, anti-lock brakes, traction control and launch control had all been banned and no attempt had been made to curtail speed.   *This is fact*, its not disputed by anyone with direct knowledge of the season, and in all of the incidents I highlighted speed and load on vehicle components were the defining factor of the crashes.  All of the on track incidents occurred because of critical component failure under load or simple loss of control i.e. the cars had been designed for electronic stabilisation systems that were no longer available. Williams remain unable to directly attribute Senna's accident to component failure (although all of that remains murky), and there remains a credible argument that, under pressure on a flat out corner with a bumpy track, he lost a difficult car that he was not yet comfortable with.  Weather was not a factor in the crashes of Senna, Ratzenberger, Barichello, Wendlinger, or Montermini - all of which were avoidable and severe.   All Lewis needed to do was put him under pressure, Rosberg has a history of making costly errors in that situation. One spin would have done the trick.                  They race under a German licence as a German company, the board who make the decisions are German. Ergo the contract would need to be compatible with German law if one or both of the parties chose to prosecute it there.    In my experience (which is around 5 years of working on improving business processes for contracts inside law firms) the client end of a sports deal involves about 10 lawyers of various ranks plus associates, support staff, and an outside team of accountants.   There will be a number of different components to the contract and each will require singular expertise their field i.e. you'll have someone on personal terms, someone on image rights, someone on sporting terms etc - a large contract such as this may even involve multiple law firms working together.   The majority of the term negotiations between the parties are conducted by each side's lawyers and accountants within the direction set by their clients. You only involve the principles when there is approval required, a disputed issue, or to finalise a component.   We came close to doing that in 1994 - banned all of the traction and driver aids that 'purist' fans said were ruining the racing, had little in the way of meaningful surface aero, and teams could run as close to the ground as they liked.  Ultimately, the cars were simply too quick and powerful to be controllable in general, and even modestly safe when something went wrong. None of the circuits were ready for such high speed accidents. Senna's death disguises a [series[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSI27en56tg) [of[2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yUxMLIbtIk) [terrifying[3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xumw9c5j-3A) [accidents[4]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd-nSWjdpHI) and on track [incidents[5]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvxMtYyNZ6Q) during 1994 that are rarely talked of anymore. The pit lane speed limits and downforce reduction measures we see today all came from that season's racing - 1994 defines modern F1.  "Its going to be a season with lots of accidents, and I'll risk saying that we'll be lucky if something really serious doesnt happen." - Ayrton Senna, during the 94' pre-season.   In the end the 94' season left two drivers dead, another in a coma, one seriously injured marshall, five injured spectators, and a seriously injured mechanic.  No one wants the spending war ground effect floors would bring, and no one wants 1994 to happen again.   Be very careful what you wish for in this regard.    Theoretically, sure. But everyone would be in the same boat, wearing at broadly the same rate, the pace of which is dictated by the lead car.   So ultimately you'd end up in same situation whilst handing an unfair penalty to anyone with a puncture or who had to stop for other reasons.   Thing is it doesn't really work like that. You always lose time pitting, its an automatic disadvantage, so extant other circumstances that would cause you to pit because you had to, all teams would run the race on one set of tyres.   Yes. At this point of development tyres can do pretty much anything F1 would like them to. So in that era they were spec'd to be quick and last the race by design, but it was quite dull.   I used the word team to imply that more than one person is involved (as is blatantly obvious).   Yes, his staff will be dealing with non-vital terms and contract minutiae - he won't be negotiating every single line himself.   We've had those. They make for incredibly dull processional racing and further penalise the drivers for racing incidents, punctures, and wing adjustments that require them to pit.   The problem is it's very hard to overtake on the old European circuits, as we've just seen, so increasing the pit stops adds variables and makes for better racing.    Any contract will have to apply in Germany, where Mercedes is based, and in Monaco, where Hamilton is based. To achieve that you'll need lawyers for both parties at both ends, assistants to handle messaging, arrange meetings, check amendments, and even negotiate non-important terms (i.e. things that you wouldn't trouble Lewis about) and a variety of other minutiae.    So while Lewis doesn't have management and is negotiating the important parts of the deal directly, he will have lawyers, financial advisors, and personal assistants that help him structure the whole thing - hence the perfectly acceptable use of the word 'team' in my comment.   Team, as in team of lawyers and personal staff.   I read that at the time, but Fernando didn't answer the posed question directly and the report from Shanghai was unsourced. Having it from Allison confirms the speculation was true - and many people on here have disputed these earlier reports.       The *idea* that this was the case is old news, but I don't think that we have had confirmation from Alonso or Allison that it was actually what happened, hence "Allison admits" in the headline.  	197
 Cheez-its and Mountain Dew is a favorite. Oreos are also fantastic.   Flexing is not a turn on. I'm sorry.  What is nice, is a randomly clean counter or something.

There's a big quest besides all of the Dragonborn stuff? I just got the game and went straight onto Dragonborn quests. It was escape being executed, Riverwood, Whiterun, YOU'RE A DRAGONBORN. I'm level 10 thinking the Dragonborn quests are the main ones.    I didn't like boys at all for a while (thank you Spy Kids). But then I saw Shark Boy and Lava Girl. Bi forever.

It saves the rest of the planet from walking into your backpack.  5. Do not announce it is your birthday if you did not bring a snack. 85% of people at school don't care.  6. We know you're tired. Anyone who has to wake up at 4:30 in the morning for school is tired. Stop complaining and go to sleep.   Alright, I have done my fair share of interesting presentations. You could do a paper and presentation on Japanese culture. Or Vocaloids. I was asked by a teacher to put together a powerpoint and the class was absolutely hooked by singing holograms. It really is fun to research. You could write a persuasive paper on a famous (or even controversial) person. I have a friend who wrote a persuasive essay on why Ivan the Terrible wasn't actually that terrible. Freedom and the Internet is also a go-to topic for me.     What type of topic are you aiming for?   Thank you! My brain must have shut down~   Could someone explain the Imperialist?   I now enjoy you greatly. The only thing that could have made the Japanese better was if it was possible to put it in someone's voice.      Absolutely.

Hitchens is quoted as saying "*it was either that or Sacred Cow, and I thought Sacred Cow would be in bad taste.*"  The subheading is 'Mother Teresa: In Theory   in Practice'    Google has many. My main source is Christopher Hitchens' book '*The Missionary Position*'   [See this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1a21l8/okay_well_keep_you_on_the_cover_hitler_but_fuck/c8tixny)   Yes. My main sauce is Christopher Hitchen's book '*The Missionary Position*', I suggest you start there. There are plenty more; several documentaries have interviewed Nuns previously in Mother Teresa's employ who worked at the hospices. Plenty of people visited the hospices, especially in Calcutta and gave plenty of evidence to the squalid conditions. There is a huge amount of sauce material on this.  Before Bernie Madoff broke the record, the largest fraud in history was done by a man named Charles Keating. Keating donated much of his ill gotten money to Mother Teresa's organisation. After he was caught it was requested that Teresa give the money back, though she had no legal obligation to do so, so it could be returned to those who had been defrauded by Keating. Not one penny was returned. This is historical fact. Just because you have not looked up the sauces, does not mean they do not exist or aren't credible.             Not at all. I have explained my opinion. If you want to disagree with me that is your privilege. I have better things to do than troll the internet though   Agreed, and Mother Teresa absolutely shouldn't be.  EDIT: allow me to clarify. Mother Teresa is one of those people who gained a reputation by having a reputation. She did not, as some of you fine people appear to think, save millions of lives, or even improve the condition of those lives. She ran hospices for the dying. According to credible sauces those in her care were not allowed medicine or visits from family or friends and were expected to suffer and die. In fact, Teresa herself many times spoke of how important 'suffering' was to her ministry. Meanwhile she is flying around the world shaking hands and accepting cheques from all sorts of highly reputable people, such as Charles Keating or the dictators of Haiti. She was given the Nobel Peace Prize for aparently no reason at all (as was Obama and Kissinger, but thats another story), and in her acceptance speech claimed that "abortion is the biggest risk to peace". She had very little influence on the world yet gained a huge reputation, and is remember for her reputation rather than her deeds, which are questionable at best and deceitful despicable at worst.

That is not the case.   ...and Abe Lincoln!   The night is black as I lay in the sheets  My eyes are heavy as I prepare for my sleep  Suddenly a noise, I've heard it before  The tap-tap-tapping from beneath the floorboards  I freeze up inside as I hear it again  The sound of the creature hidden therein  I calm myself down, there's no need to be scared  I padlocked his cage, he's going nowhere   "Mommy Mommy, I saw a monster!" Timmy shrieked as he rushed out of the bathroom and into his mothers arms.  Smiling very slightly the mother held her son as he hugged her in fright, stroking his hair soothingly. "I've told you Timmy there's no such thing as monsters! You have such an imagination! Where did you see it?"  "In the bathroom," Timmy said in a small voice, still clutching his mother as all small children will do when they are frightened.  Mother knew her son had an overactive imagination and would not be able to sleep until she had proven there was no monster to him. She glanced up at the bathroom door, which had been left ajar.  A thrill of horror shot up her spine as she saw the mirror. Suddenly she felt the bile rising in her throat as though she was about to be sick. Her son was still reflected in the glass as though he was still standing before the mirror, yet her son had never looked like this, never looked so evil.  The thing in the mirror that so resembling her son gazed malevolently back out at her, an evil smile rising on its face. Its lips started to move.  "Let's play," said Timmy.   Fun fact: Both these men appear on modern currency, Lincoln on the American Penny, Darwin on the English twenty pound note.      "I made a promise Mister Frodo, a promise!

In the time it takes you to realise what is wrong, it will already be too late   Part of me salutes you for this response as you are, like so many other people have done, bending over backwards to make something that is so painfully obviously immoral into something good. Your explanation of original sin is good, mankind by its very nature is selfish, it is one of the three most obvious products of our long evolution (These being: self-preservation, the impulse for food and the impulse for sex). This helps to make nonsense of the commandment '*Love Thy Neighbour as you would yourself*'. The thing simply cannot be done, the most altruistic, loving person you know would not be able to accomplish such a feat. HOWEVER, though I respect your argument, *this is not an explanation of Original Sin*. Not even close. This is you attempt to justify an obviously immoral practise, for which I do not blame you. Original Sin is the hereditary blame passed down through the male line for Eve's bite from the fruit of knowledge. It is punishment that every human being inherits from the moment of conception for the crime committed by a distant ancestor. *This is not moral*. Just to compound the offence, let us look again at the 10 commandments. The punishment God lays down for making a graven image is: "*I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation*". The punishment of children for the crimes of their parents or grandparents is universally considered immoral today, let alone the condemnation of the entire human race for a non-crime committed, that hurt no one, by a fictional character in the antiquated past. This is, there is no other word, evil. I respect your attempt to square this by granting a different explanation, but by its very nature you can not cherry pick religion.   Please do not cast this response aside as argumentative, I would like to provide a reasoned counter argument to your comment but I do not wish to offend anyone.  What I find deeply troubling and disturbing about what you have said is that /u/kblaxchick "*is a sinner and deserves to be tossed into a lake of fire*". Yet you don't know this person and neither do I, the odds are that no one on this thread knows this person well enough to make any sort of judgement close to that in magnitude; it is a serious thing to say. Yet, because of what we already know about Christianity, this statement is normal and fair and you got 5 up-votes. We should see there is something wrong here. Christianity teaches, as you have already acknowledged, that *all* people, every man woman and child, is a sinner and should burn in torment forever and ever. Take a moment to consider, *why*? It is something more sinister than emotional blackmail, due to the condemnation of our basic human urges every Christian child has it burned into their mind that they are wicked and are going to go to hell if they don't believe in Jesus. You may say it is not like that, but you have already shown that this thought-process is 'normal' and to a child's mind visions of hellfire and the devil are more than just stories. The conscription of children for the purpose of this kind of blackmail is evil, there is no other word. If you had not had this done to you as a child, you might not have been so quick to call /u/blaxchick a sinner deserving of hell. If we are all sinners then God should have taken care to create a different species. It is the classic dogma of a person being created sick, and commanded on pain of eternal torment to be well. Christopher Hitchens compared it to living in a theological North Korea, "*but at least you can fucking die and leave North Korea.*"   Thank you for your response! I don't want to offend anyone so before I write a response of my own, would you welcome a reasonable theological discussion about what you have written or would you take offence?    If I may interject, I don't think an adversarial debate is really getting anyone anywhere, so lets put our pitchforks down shall we?   As to /u/josh_thompson's point about historical evidence of The Bible. I'm afraid he does have a strong argument, there is excellent archeological as well as historic evidence that there was no exile from Egypt, there was no wandering in the desert. There have been many archeological attempts to research these topics, all of which overwhelmingly agree that these stories are erroneous. There are other checkable dates or events in The Bible that have since proven to be inaccurate after careful research, for example the census at the time of Jesus' birth and Noah's flood, for examples. If these stories are true they are checkable and verifiable through a number of methods, and the unavoidable fact is there is plenty of evidence to show that they are not true; they are myths, stories and parables. Now look at other Bible stories such as Abraham's readiness to sacrifice Isaac, or the slaughtering of the citizens of Sodom, Gomorra or Jericho, the detailed commandments on the keeping of slaves. In that light, aren't you just a little glad that The Bible is not infallible?   As for /u/this_to_shall_pass's points about science. You are quite correct, there are many complicated things that science as yet can not fully explain, although not the items you list. The danger comes when we start to see the holes in science and automatically fill them with God. For a great deal of history God was credited with the creation of humanity. We now know, thanks to Darwin, that we have a entirely satisfactory explanation for the existence of complex life, thus God is demoted to sunsets and mountains etc (all of which are perfectly explainable). This is called '*God of the gaps*', and most theists (believers) try to avoid due to its fickle nature. Just because science cannot yet explain something, that gives no indication that God is any more credible, and when science discovers an explanation for a phenomena such as gravity, geology or life on Earth, God is instantly discredited.  As to my own point of view. I look at the world (and my own human body) and I see extraordinary wonder in the complexity and beauty of what we all have. The chance that every human is given at life is precious beyond words because of its uniqueness and finiteness. You will never have a second chance at living this life and there is so much wonder to be seen and had that makes life precious, the most precious commodity there is. The idea that this life is a mere waiting room, a passage to the hereafter (incidentally, if life after death is infinite, what exactly is the reason for this life, or Earth at all?) then that utterly demeans life and destroys its value. Your life is so precious because it will never come again. You only have one chance to make the very most you can of it. Don't waste it.  Please don't think I am being aggressive or argumentative in this response, I felt it might be useful to open a reasonable discussion on this, rather than an aggressive discussion, and I welcome any response that is reasonable.   In a completely respectful way, I would like to ask you to explain why this is? Please do not mistake me for the classic Reddit-style 'fire and brimstone' atheist, I am simply curious about your faith, and would love to hear your point of view!   It would end in a fist-fight between Hitler and Stalin while Mao quietly commits atrocities under the table.   I don't think it is the default. It is just that a lot of people express their (pretty lame) dig at society or social norms by posting on /r/athiesm. Not to say that there aren't plenty of thought out, intelligent posts on there as well.   Pretty much every line in 'A Hard Rains A-Gonna Fall'   No. Just like all things in The Bible there is no way of quantifying these facts and this is merely someones opinion, not a historically accurate and verifiable fact. Personally, due to the actual quote being *'The valley of the shadow of Death'* I would say it is very obviously metaphor for living in adversity.  Also this is a reverse causation. There exists now a valley called that. That does not however mean that that is what the line refers to. It may be more accurate to assume that the valley is named for the psalm, not vice versa.   Is...is that why its called pi?   pedanticism is not a sense of humour.   This man will never eat shellfish again   I take this to be a metaphor for absolute confidence going in followed by instant disaster.   Nothing in life is ever this simple. I think your username is a lie!   If you have to ask that question, I think its fair to say the answer is 'yes'   Two of my grandparents had bi-polar, so there is fairly even chance I will develop it in later life and I am already showing signs (I'm 22). I absolutely empathise with the difficulty of knowing there is a chance you will not always been mentally "normal", it can be quite a burden to bare.    All of you?!   A lot of people went to school with me, and now I have 16K link karma! As you can see I have done very well for myself!   If it please the court, I would like to submit myself as a witness for the prosecution as it was I who originally caught /u/bballgamer on [this thread on TIL](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/18m93t/til_that_at_the_premiere_of_beethovens_9th_police/) and bought the case to the attention of the authorities of Reddit.   I wrote my University Thesis on Beethoven and Mozart. I fail to see the relevance to someone flooding on Reddit.   indeed, especially karma whoring to this degree   everyone should know about /r/YouShouldKnow    stop reposting top posts from this subreddit. This is the 15^th today.   Dude, stop just reposting the top TIL posts. Seriously. This is your 14^th  post on TIL today, all of which are reposts.  	125
       Interesting fact I only recently learned: Apparently, Q Jr. was played by John de Lancie's actual son. The things you learn at 3am when you ought to be asleep.   And how many of them did she get involved with, in the end?   Maybe his aim wasn't that good.   But Gideon doesn't know what this Barry Allen should do. Gideon knows what *that* Barry Allen did.   How can light be both a particle and a wave?   The answer probably is "the writers didn't sit down and plan out a coherent idea of how time travel works beforehand, they just went with what they thought looked cool and, yes, advanced the plot". Which is unfortunate, but I've decided to turn off my brain regarding that little detail. (It's okay if you don't take that route.)   I suppose.   Unethical? I don't think so. She has a pretty strong case for necessity here.    THAT IS UTTERLY BEYOND THE PALE. Ew, ew, ew.   Not Grodd, G- oh, wait, nevermind.   Many - indeed, most shows - do in fact end on a giant cliffhanger. They want to make sure you tune in in several months.  *Do you have any idea of any concept of time? time doesn't just break*  No, and you can't go into the past either. Except that this is fiction and you can, and time can do whatever the heck the writers want because they're making it all up.   He said 136 years, but really, lots of people say lots of things.   Speedforce?   It's sorta going by the parallel timelines rule, and it's sorta going by the timey wimey rule, and in this particular instance it's definitely going by the back to the futures rule.   These are people who don't understand *locks*. Simple logic and probability is equally out of their reach.   Jay Garrick hates Eobard and wanted to kill him (or arrest him, or beat him up) and so Eobard decided to get while the getting's good?   I did *not* anticipate that ending.  On the one hand, wow, I was shocked and crying at Eddie's sacrifice.  On the other hand, I really liked Eddie. I don't know that I want him to be dead.  On the other other hand, even people with little knowledge of comics know that dead people come back all the time.   I didn't see that. I'll have to rewatch later :)   Oddly, the only Q episodes I actually *enjoy* are the ones on Voyager. The rest... meh at best, rage at worst.   While you're on your do-gooder streak, don't forget to let people know about those girls in Cleveland.   Yeah, it is, but I think Clive has the capacity to be pragmatically rational about the whole thing. Once he gets over the initial squick factor.   Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.    Well, we already knew that bodily fluids would do it.   Now, if only there was a rational reason. Creepy and yuck. Seriously, who *does* that? There is a *limit*, man.   That's exactly why she dumped him, she mopes about it for a while.   Oooh, whatshisface is zombiefied? WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED? Now I guess the only thing to ask is this pre-creepy bloodlicking or post?   Fuck, you called it! Good job!   Gosh I hope so.   Yes.   How else is she supposed to do it? It's not like those people need them anymore, anyway. It's like organ donation.   No, don't, you'll get zombie cooties.   Thank you, Ravi, for initiating The Talk with Liv. You keep pressing that point... although, in fairness, unlike in a certain other CW series I could mention this season, Liv managed to make a logical point about why she thinks ignorance may be safer.  Edit: You know, Clive's pretty smart. They could benefit by bringing him in as well. And maybe Clive could help them convince Major.   Your point *is invalid* because you are *not correct*. Many people who went west had no intention of settling  and *all* of them were implicitly going to wage war on the existing inhabitants. Many of those people brought their families. Nitpicking word choice and saying "you made a mistake so you're wrong" is almost as childish as downvoting people who disagree with you. I may as well say "your point is wrong because there is no such thing as the "*oregan" trail."   You can keep repeating "they all went to settle, they all went to settle, they all went to settle" at the top of your little lungs, but it's not going to make that statement any more true.  Furthermore, even if that had been the intent of every single emigrant who went west - so what? It is not morally better to put your child at risk because you want to "settle" than because you want to "explore". If you're trying to make that claim, you need to have some sort of argument to back it up. And, to be clear, an argument is not "settling isn't exploring! settling isn't waging war!" You need to provide some basis for why the two activities are morally different. (And it *was* waging war, ffs, so, again, that argument is utterly invalid. Why the heck do you think there are so many forts along the Oregon Trail?)   I'm not missing your point. I'm saying I *disagree* with it. Contrary to what you might believe, when two people disagree it is not always because one doesn't understand the other.  Among other things, your point is invalid because not every settler who went west - even those who brought their families - had any intention of "settling new territory". Many of them planned to go out for a time and then come back and had no intent to "make a new home". Your analogy is false. An argument based on that analogy fails at the start.   Not all of them actually planned to "settle" and "colonize". You'd be surprised how many just intended to make a quick buck and go home - and yes, many of them still either brought their kids with them or made more while they were out there!  And they *all* knew the risks of the behavior and the high child mortality rate. Choosing to go from London to America with your children, or from New York to Utah or Oregon (back in the earlier days of those movements), was putting those children's lives in more than usual danger, and their parents absolutely knew it. They made their choice. It's not like it's somehow a more responsible act to increase your kid's chance of premature death if you plan to settle than if you just plan to explore. The end result is the same.  Really, what *is* the child mortality rate for Federation children being raised on starships? I don't know. Do you? My guess is it isn't much higher than that of children raised on planets - and it's much lower than that of people on the freaking Oregon Trail.   Well, if you accept that the last two books exist.   If you're not interested in having a serious discussion about TV shows, why are you here? No sarcasm, I'm actually quite curious. If you don't want to take it seriously, you don't have to, but you're not going to get very far responding to somebody who is having fun doing just that with "it's just a TV show".   And many of them had to wage war to survive (kinda goes with the territory when you're the invaders) and many more didn't survive.    Did Lewis and Clark bring 4-year-old children with them on their expedition? Did Magellan? Would it be a good idea?  Sacajawea did. And yes, while 4 is a little young, children Wesley's age and younger were employed on exploratory vessels and warships when Columbus and Magellan were sailing around the world. We speak of "men" serving on those ships, but by our standards many of them were *boys*. It wasn't that uncommon for them to still be in their single digits, only eight or nine years old.  http://www.thepeacefulsea.com/life-at-sea.html   If I had my kids aboard the Enterprise, I'd sure be getting them off at the next starbase after the auto-destruct countdown in Where Silence Has Lease. Imagine telling your children they were going to die (or not telling them) and getting down to just a few seconds... for a normal person, that would be a traumatizing experience, but for the Enterprise crew (and civilians, and children) that's just Tuesday.  So you stay home, and because "home" is a colony in the Borg's path, you all get assimilated.  Or you don't, but the Dominion invades and you lose everything.  Or the sun explodes and you all die.  Or somebody is really pissed about the sun thing, so he goes back in time, comes to your world and, logically, pays you back by destroying your sun. (Man, what a stupid thing to do. Why not give Romulus a head's up so they can begin fixing the problem before it starts? Well, I guess that's why the baddy wasn't a Vulcan.)  Or your kid likes to play Parisi Squares, and they get into an accident and die.  Or a visiting alien brings a disease they picked up on some other planet, something undetectable and with a long incubation rate, but highly contagious, and everybody dies. (Don't think I pulled this one from an existing ST plot, so don't ask.)  The point is, there are no guarantees in life. Death comes *unexpectedly*, that's kinda the whole point. You think it's gonna hit you on the Enterprise, so you decide to go sightseeing on Earth, but it turns out it's waiting for you in Samarra the whole time. Whoops.  You can't really be safe, no matter where you go.   You are by far the most useful bot I've yet encountered.    DS9 has the "arc-based" storytelling that we're used to nowadays, the other series are much more episodic in nature. For that reason, I for one find it an easier watch than the other series, in which every episode unrealistically has a reset button and they always seem to end on a joke no matter how many hapless ensigns have been killed by the space monster or the cunningly disguised social allegory *this* week. (Yes, this is a hugely broad brush I'm painting with. I'm not actually intending to insult anybody's favorite Trek. Each series has its good points and its low points, its shining episodes and its clunkers.)  However, if you're going to *start* with DS9 you'll miss some of the references that you're expected to just know. Might as well go watch Babylon 5, right?   Sooooo, even though TNG is not my favorite series by a long shot (notwithstanding the fact that Patrick Stewart is terrific in every part he ever plays ever), I'd say start with that. Just feel free to skip over any episode, especially in the first couple of seasons, that is excessively stupid or cheesy. If you're still cringing after the first ten minutes, read the synopsis at Memory Alpha and move on.   There's some overlap.   Well, not usually. Breeding is a form of evolution and it is "goal directed", but people tend to forget that.   Correct word, though not commonly used in American English, we might say "a laugh" or just "it is also hilarious". (But most of us know what the word means, so you're fine. This isn't criticism, it's language geekery.)               Unimatrix 0 probably would make a more interesting TV show than Unimatrix 351.   While hiding in the grass giggling? It could happen!   That's because they usually do it backwards. Instead of plotting it out and then writing the scripts to fit the arc, they write the scripts, through in a whole bunch of "mysterious" elements and arc-seeds, and then try to get it to all fit together by the end, hopefully wrapping up all the storylines.    Can they really? Huh. I did not know that.   Yes, remember that episode where the Doctor had a holofamily and learned the moral lesson that real people can't just shut off their lives like a game of The Sims to avoid pain and then *never visited his holofamily again*? His son was hanging out with Klingon friends and listening to god-awful popular adolescent Klingon music.   What, *seriously*? Clearly, I have been avoiding TNG at my peril. (I admit it, it's not my favorite Trek, and I've yet to watch the whole thing from start to finish. But I'm sure we can all get along.)   Given the state of Sesame Street today, maybe our society IS stagnating. I like to pretend that show ended a few decades ago.    Well, that's pointless. Most of the Federation is not part of Starfleet. Not all spaceflight is contracted through Starfleet either. How are those people protected if the great mass of all spacefarers can do whatever they like?  Unless Data meant, perhaps, that "The Prime Directive" applies to Starfleet, but civilians have laws in that area as well? That seems like the excessively pedantic thing he'd do.   Flotter might prove the OP's point. Samantha Wildman played (experienced?) Flotter holonovels as a child, and now her daughter is doing the same.  Then again, parents frequently want their kids to read and watch things that are one generation or more behind the times, what they themselves grew up with.   Is that officially stated anywhere?   Nothing. Remember why they wouldn't intervene directly during the Occupation? What Cardassia did on Bajor was officially considered an internal problem and none of their business.  My guess is that within recognized Federation space they put up warning beacons or some such stating that no contact is allowed and violators will be charged with a crime, but they may not be able to enforce that outside of more heavily populated regions of space, and there's nothing they can do for pre-warp cultures in neutral territory or otherwise outside of the Federation, even if the planet happens to have been surveyed by a Federation ship first.  But it's possible they have some sort of treaty with the other major players regarding who "owns" surveyed planets that aren't clearly in one group's territory, where the one who is in control of the planet (possibly by being the first one to register that they've surveyed it - this is all my thinking as I type on what would be the most likely approach) gets to make the rules.   Alternative answer: Earth is currently going through a fad for history and past cultures. (We have no idea if this trend is widespread through the Federation. All your examples are of humans.) Everything old is new again, and in another two decades the fashion will be to be stunningly up-to-date and profess ignorance of history.  Alternative two: Like before, except that it's not "Earth" it's just "Starfleet", perhaps under the influence of a couple of prominent captains and admirals, such as Picard, that everybody wants to emulate and that happen to have an interest in the past. (Except it's too obvious to be obsessed with Shakespeare and classical music and jazz because Picard is your hero and Riker is your runner-up, or baseball because you've read everything you can on Sisko who is SO awesome, so instead you focus on rock music or Cold War spy dramas or the Alamo or, I don't know, King Arthur.) It's "cool" to have an esoteric interest in the past, and the more individualized, the better.   If the ending did happen, I like to imagine Kara just ducked behind a tall strand of grass and giggled her butt off when they started looking for her.   I am doing something about it. I'm supporting this proposal. Hey!    A city is already a highly disrupted environment. With current technology, it can't be a low-human impact environment no matter what you do.  Indeed, but the light pollution from a city impacts rural land for a *long* way out. Light pollution, by its nature, is not compact or concentrated.  Additionally, as pointed out, there are real health risks. Do you know that women who live where they can read outside at midnight have a 78% greater chance of developing breast cancer than those who live where there is little light pollution?   I don't know if it is firmly established in canon that the military and Obsidian Order are typical of all Cardassians everywhere. I wouldn't base my opinions of Americans on our CIA and Marines, you know?  But let's say they are more backstabby in general. As you say, their backstabbing takes the form of "active betrayal for the benefit of themselves and their family". Humans aren't immune to that! (Equinox, amiright? Also, who the heck is behind these names? A ship named Voyager goes on a long Voyage. A ship named "equal night" does evil things. A ship named Defiant defies the Dominion. What's next, a ship named Lollipop? That'd be a good ship!) But Seska doesn't do that. Seska betrays everybody just 'cuz she can.    I suppose it would be interesting to have the bad guys win for good for a change. Might make the rest of the season a little depressing, though. They'd have to change the title from Star Trek: Voyager to Borg Collective: Unimatrix 351.  Now I can't get the thought of Borg television out of my head. Actually, that would be interesting. We know so little about what the Borg do other than assimilate people and, in the case of the Queen, be creepily sexually frustrated.   Tim Russ acted the hell out of that job, but there isn't much character development or range when you're playing an excessively straight-up and literal-minded interpretation of a Vulcan.   Is it? We see a wide range of Cardassian personalities on DS9 - Cardassians who wish to force their people to recognize the crimes committed on Bajor, Cardassians who want to institute democratic reforms, Cardassian soldiers who are stolid and unemotional and lacking that certain creativity needed to engage in productive backstabbing (that's Damar)....  Tangent: Now that I think about it, DS9 is as much about the Cardassians as it is about Bajorans.  The two Cardassians we see the most are Dukat and Garak. I'll tackle Garak first.  Obviously, Garak is capable of backstabbing people with aplomb. I'll take it as given that this goes with the territory when you're a member of the Obsidian Order. I'll *not* take it as given that every Cardassian is equally capable of being a member of said order, no more than every human and Vulcan is capable of being a member of Section 31. However, on the show, how often do we really see him backstabbing people? And when we do see it, do we *ever* see him doing this just because he had a whim to do so? If you ask me, the one defining feature of Garak is his steadfast loyalty to his people and his willingness to suffer to improve things for Cardassia. That's his own never-ending sacrifice. If he does betray people, he does it for what he has determined is a good cause - not just because it seems like fun.  Then there's Dukat. And Dukat is so backstabby that his own superior officers didn't trust him not to flee if the station got blown up. Good call. But two things. First, Dukat is crazy - and if that episode where he hallucinates proves anything, it proves that he's been crazy a *long* time. The hallucinations might be new, but they're just gravy. Secondly, even Dukat doesn't just backstab everybody just for the lulz. Consider his relationship with Kira. He promised her mother that he'd look out for her children. Pragmatically speaking, he didn't have to keep that promise. Really, what was the woman gonna do if he violated it, complain? But not only did he keep it, but he continued to keep it (according to the novels anyway) after her death. Kira may be right that Dukat is a selfish bastard who doesn't know what love is, but he certainly made the effort. Or consider Ziyal - actually, let's consider Ziyal in a separate paragraph.  Ziyal is a sweet, friendly young woman who couldn't backstab an armadillo. Yes, you're thinking, but she was half Bajoran and raised Bajoran. Consider the years in the slave camp, though. The other Cardassians freely warned her that her father might not save her. They didn't betray her, they gave her useful advice. And when her father *does* decide to bring her home, he sticks with her, even though this does him no favors with his family. Dukat clearly has the capability to refrain from casual sociopathy.  Now, let's look at Seska. Seska backstabs everybody all over the place, and for what purpose? Her actions have no chance of gaining her anything, and she keeps doing it even as they make her position more and more precarious. FFS, when Chakotay told Janeway that little parable about the scorpion and the frog, he wasn't talking about the Borg, he meant Seska! The Borg were more reliable than her!  If Seska had sought to improve her situation without considering how it affected others, that would be at least consistent with the more backstabby Cardassians we see, such as Dukat. But she just betrayed people for kicks! Stupid and pointless. Not the hallmarks of a compelling character, and not a terribly convincing portrayal of the Cardassian mindset either.   We all have to make sacrifices for the greater good.   No, instead they had their fairy tale ending with deities. Or something. Not really sure....   Paying people is contrary to his utopian vision of Federation economy.   Except for that last season. Ugh, what *was* that?   And Seska. A Cardassian infiltrator rightly disliked and distrusted by both sides, forced to stick it out with them anyway on the chance of getting home in 70 years - that could've been interesting.  Instead, she was just another Cardassian infected by chronic backstabbing syndrome.    There are multiple benefits to reducing light pollution, as listed upthread.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627884/   If you see it as such a big priority, and if it is really so easy, why don't you so it for them? If you pay for it out of pocket and handle the installation, I'm sure plenty of buildings would be more than happy for you to install some energy saving equipment.  Whatever happened to personal responsibility?   Nope, the lamest thing you can do is insulting others based on them "residing on the first floor of a tenement", whether or not that happens to be true.   Whole spices last longer and are generally a better investment. I also generally find they're less expensive because I am more able to buy them in bulk, however, ymmv. (I use a dedicated coffee grinder if I need them ground.)   Okay, so when you shine lights all around and it affects my health and the environment and my ability to see the stars, that's the free society. But when the government says "shut down the lights if you're not using them", that's "butting into people's lives"?  So you can butt into my life, but the government can't butt into yours, is that it?     No one would pay New York any mind if it weren't for its built form and buildings  That's a completely ridiculous assertion and you know it.  But if it's true - I say, bring it on! Let's ditch all the fucking tourists! (And, as a bonus, we get to get rid of *you*. Win-win all around, I say.)   I can't stand that "warm orange glow". Makes me feel like I'm walking around in an oddly colored horror flick.   It's not enough to use LEDs, you also have to design the lights so the light goes directly down and very little is directed sideways or up.  Having the lights on a motion sensitive dimmer might also help - say, if they were dim normally, but brightened up a little when a person car went under them. But I don't know how feasible that upgrade would be.   Indeed. Incidentally, I believe that when referring to Deaf culture, one uses a capital letter.      Marco's Millions. It's the prequel to The Boxes.   Good for you. For a while, no joke, paperback was hovering in the $80s.      It goes for an insane price at Amazon, or at least it did last time I bought a copy.   It's been sixteen days. Are the weeks longer on Bajor?   Sure, there are more of those jobs now - but nearly all the job growth since the recession has been in low-wage service industry jobs. Jobs that people will quite blithefully declare "don't deserve" a living wage to do.  Our society will take decades to adjust to post-scarcity economics. By the time it reaches us, I'll be dead of old age. In the interim, things are gonna *suck*.    I didn't ask for a list of jobs, I asked which ones are in the list of most common jobs in America.  http://www.ranker.com/list/most-common-jobs-in-america/american-jobs  None of your list are on the list of most common jobs in America. Since the recession, nearly all job growth has been in low wage service industry jobs - not in computer *anything*.   No, not based on reality. I think you're either making this up wholesale, or heavily exaggerating, because the statistics - as compared to your anecdata - says that there's no such thing.   That, in a nutshell, is why I buy Orson Scott Card's books *used*.  My rule of thumb is that if I'm pretty sure they're still doing whatever terrible thing it is (or would still be doing it if they had the chance), then I won't financially support them. If they've stopped doing it (or are dead), then so long as the art itself doesn't glorify rape or abuse, I'm okay with it. Other people will have different personal approaches, and that's all right too.   Well, unless the Deaf activists all set out for their own colony where they can preserve Deaf culture in perpetuity.   ...like that novel Blindsight, but with less of a dystopian vibe, and without the blindness.   Welfare queens are a myth. They don't exist in any sort of actual numbers. They never did.   Perhaps like in that extremely preachy DS9 two parter where they go back in time and the captain replaces a rioter?   It's a city, not a corporation. It doesn't have or need a "brand". The city is made by people, not buildings.    If it were recessive, wouldn't that mean that squibs cannot be born to two magical parents?  Not necessarily. It might be that a certain "squib gene" blocks magic in individuals that would otherwise have had it.   Oh, I think dimming the lights certainly will have an impact, as will improving our street lighting.   And why should we leave the skyline alone? Are you also suggesting we should never put up new buildings, as those affect the skyline? Or that we should never tear down old or decrepit ones?  Keeping the skyline as is to appease one dude on reddit seems like a very silly notion.   Why not?   Light pollution interferes with our ability to view the night sky (so anybody interested in astronomy cares), disrupts ecosystems (so environmentalists care), and has health effects (so anybody human either cares or ought to care).   No such thing is required in any state, although IDs may be required for certain activities, such as driving, buying various controlled substances, and voting.   Then they lied to you. 10% of Americans do not have any form of legal identification. They are not breaking any national or state law.  Some people will say any old thing.   http://blogs.findlaw.com/law_and_life/2014/02/do-you-have-to-carry-id-with-you-at-all-times.html    Yes, with the right documents. And what if they can't obtain those documents? What if they can't get to the DMV? What if they don't have the fee?   Would you kill your daughter if she got pregnant? Would you kick her out of the home? Would you exile her to Tranquility Bay? Would you lock her in her room and deny her all contact outside the family until she turned 18, and *then* kick her out and not pay for any form of education or support?  Oh, no? Well, then you're not the reason young women need to be able to make this decision without parental input if necessary.   You don't need to show an ID to get medical treatment. If you show up to the hospital with a broken bone, but you're one of the 10% of Americans without an ID, they don't just send you home.   10% of adult American citizens do not have an ID. The trouble is that once you're in that hole, it's hard to gather the points of identification needed to get an ID, because many of those things are not available without an ID. If this sounds Kafkaesque, that's because it is.   Maybe we can be the biggest and the best at *not being wasteful*. We can take pride in having *visible stars*.     When the personal computing revolution happened, a lot of jobs were made obsolete, and yet many new jobs were created through the economic growth that computers have driven  Most of those jobs seem to have been in trucking. A great number of other jobs were in low-wage fields such as cashiering and waitressing. How many genuinely *new* jobs are common nowadays? Say, in the top 50 list.  I can name one - software engineer.   What new occupations have been opened up in the past decade?    Ideally with enough automation, no one would need to have a job to sustain a comfortable lifestyle anyway.   Post scarcity is gonna be great, sure... if we all survive the interim which is filled with people saying "If they don't work, they don't eat" and acting like this is compassion.                                                                                                            I'm thinking about it.                        These are people who have apparently never heard of locks. It takes a special kind of person to work in STAR Labs.         Yup. I'd love it more if Liv spoke to other female recurring characters more than once every other episode.   Stupidity. Sheer, crushing stupidity.   Sure, why not?   Kinda has to be. How many authors have the initials V. V. V.?            No wonder that customer said the visions were "boring"!   Like in Heroes...?            Have you read the article? Because it certainly is explained therein.    the difference between 6 months and 8 months really isn't a big difference to me or anyone.  At 25 weeks of pregnancy the is a 50% chance at viability with medical assistance in case of a premature birth. At 32 weeks, that chance is at 96%. At 22 weeks, the chance is 0%.   It's right there in the article that it won't change abortion legality when it comes to certain medical conditions, rape, and incest. That's the point.  Elective abortions are still legal - if rare - at 21 weeks. And don't forget that in addition to the closing of abortion clinics throughout the US, many states have mandatory "waiting periods" between when you go in to get an abortion and when you are able to have it done. Those can push you closer to the 20 week mark.   It's not terribly uncommon for a woman to not know she's pregnant until three or four months. My own mother didn't know she was pregnant with me until four months, because she was traveling and she always had a late period when traveling! Women who have irregular periods are especially prone to not realizing that *this* time it's late because of a pregnancy.                                                Abortion and also the most effective forms of birth control, because those "might" really be abortions in disguise (even though all the science indicates that they're not).   Elective abortions at eight or nine months aren't legal, so I don't see what you're arguing about. The only abortions at that point are when the fetus is already dead, or has a condition incompatible with life that puts the mother at risk if she tries to carry to term anyway.  You're creating a false connection between "abortions at 21 weeks" (rare, but legal, and generally for medical reasons instead of elective reasons) and "abortions at 8 months" (not legal except where medically indicated). That's like if a vegan shows up and tries to claim that my eating some fried chicken is *exactly the same* as my eating elephant steaks because, you know, elephants are an endangered species and highly intelligent.   Yes, you'd probably know, but in many states there is only one abortion clinic. A poor woman might need time to gather up money and resources to get over there and have it done.                                            	200
 Humans. Humans never change.   I kinda do see this becoming reality one day, as history repeats itself. We'd find a weaker, submissive race and make them do our dirty work.   We'd have a war or two to free them. Then they'd fight for their civil rights. And the next thing you know, we'll have legal inter-species relations with them.  I love humans!   You must have been petrified.  	2
                                                                Notorious B.I.G., "Ready to Die," which was released 20 years ago today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                	112
    Because of course it would be a black guy robbing you!   You should judge people's worth by their time given to helping others. Not by the amount of wealth they obtain.   	3
 30 fps is acceptable in every game except for fighting and driving games.   No open world....   No pools...   Not sure about that,I do know that you can transfer all ps3 content to a ps4 if you were to buy the game on ps3 then eventually get a ps4.  So worse comes to worse he could just activate everything on ps3 then transfer to ps4 then start playing.   I took public transport for a few years during college.  You just have to keep trying, eventually the motion sickness goes away.   Resogun plat.  Sports friends and strider I played a whole lot of, don't know if they count because I bought them on release. But they are great.   Play them on your phone.  If you really want then get a bluetooth controller.   I've played one character for 300 hours, might as well see the new season uniques.  If you don't wanna play season then don't..   It held attention in Diablo 2 for many many many years.   Err misread a little thought I saw 2 weeks of wear.  Yah maybe exchange for a size down.  But yah they look like they will wind up looking like a ns type fit, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.   They look good at the block and calf the knees are a little baggy, you could try wearing them higherup on your waist.  They look a little low   No reason not to.  At the end of the season your season character becomes a regular character.   Account bound items   I mean the wheelset will be $100 minimum, then you need a single speed crank which is about $45 for a cheap one, then you need to put pedals on the crank which will be about 50+ unless you go with $30 bmx pedals.  In order to put the new crankset on you will have to get a new bottom bracket for about $30-40, not to mention a new chain.   Then if you want to start off riding with brakes you will have to get specialized brakes with long arms, because you will be putting 700mm wheels on a bike that once had 27 inch wheels, so the brakes currently on the bike wont reach the wheels. Im not trying to get you down, just telling you the things I came across during my conversion.  What I though was going to be a sub $200 conversion turned into an almost $400 conversion real quick.   im just trying to say, an old conversion is probably more expensive than he thinks.   Your best bet would probably be a cheap fixie, like a retrospec.  You're looking at around 250 in that bike plus parts, vs 250 for something cheap and brand new.  I just got myself over my head with a similar rebuild, although the frame has sentimental value to me, so I guess in the long run it was worth it.  Maybe look into pure fix, retrospec, or critical.   Thanks so much! At work desperately trying to recall what they said.Haha   So you can type with a controller.that would be great.right   When getting selvedge tapered you need to specify that they must taper the inseam.  You are probably out of luck, although your tailor did one of the best jobs at maintaining the selvedge line I've ever seen, it looks interesting.   I remember during the tavern talk they confirmed if you have unlocked adventure mode you can play through the new season starting in adventure, is that just softcore, or can you in hardcore as well?      Clarks are pretty comfortable, and look good with jeans. Great with chinos as well.  Something like these maybe.  I don't have any experience with hush puppies, so just my 2 cents.  http://www.shoes.com/Mobile/ProductDetail.aspx?originalReferrer=direct p=EC1390151 pg=5220384 campaign=Clarks CMP=KNC-adwordspla cpc=adwordspla gclid=CJ-BwJyhqcACFSdk7AodrCkAJA k_clickid=42bbb3f1-abb0-2d69-eb5f-00006d7b9a8a KPID=5220384-EC1390151-12.0M partnerid=adwordspla     I'll be in on one if you do a second run lmk.  Love it.   Most avid pc gamers do have that hardware, true.but that won't keep a company afloat.  50-60 in a scene with nothing going on is not stable at all.  I agree with your last statement, but they released this video and now everyone thinks it's how games will look.  Ie darksouls and watchdogs.   Thanks!   Unstable fps, 720p to display empty rooms with minimal lighting.  On a computer that most people don't have.   That's because it probably is a movie.   "In action"not much action going on there.nothing for the consumer will look like that, and the internet will be angry.   First thing I noticed.  Can you change Keybinds at all?I couldn't find it      It's a normal practice.the games aren't developed on xbox ones... They are developed on computers.  If something is wrong with the demo I'd rather them be able to go in and fix it really quick rather than pack up and go home.   Size 12 normally, almost. 155lbs?  And I agree with charwinger21 you should get your true measurements and look for an unbranded sizing chart, unless you have a retail spot to try them on.ordering your first pair of raws can be tricky business.   My size and height exactly, tapered vs skinny is more of a personal preference.if you don't own many jeans and aren't used to jeans then I'd probably recommend the tapered.they should look great, and will be more comfortable for daily use.  Good luck.  Be warned they will feel really tight for a couple weeks while they stretch out a bit.   You take that back.   Also the blue jean bar by Fenway park,I believe they have railcar.Not sure what else   Forgot about ball and buck, is pretty new. I think they only carry tellason but check out out anyhow for sure.   Barneys of new York has apc raleigh n f, the wilderness workshop underneath the tannery has 3sixteen. The tannery in Harvard square carries baldwin amongst other brands, and it's next door to concepts which sometimes gets nice stock. Riccardi on newbury st is fun to browse if you have cash to burn, real high end type stuff.  Kaze shabu in Chinatown does a great hot pot.  Santarpios in east Boston does the best pizza in town, especially their anchovy (trust me).  If your looking for pasteries go to bovvas or modern, do yourself a favor and skip the hype lines at Mike's.   Sneaky peaky like   Half life 3 confirmed   @feltraiger is good for workwear menswear.   100%   Thanks anyhow, good luck   Usually on 12am to 5am est   Silver 2 looking to pug less.I'm not the best, but not bad.never played with a team and tried actual strats, but I have decent aim and good map sense.  If you ever need a fill in add me @ entangel   Gotta look for the rb etching in the bottom corner of the right? Lense   It's actually quite comfortable to ride, just need to sacrifice aesthetics and keep the saddle low.   Thanks, yah I know. But the frame has sentimental value to me, so figure I'll ride it until I save enough for a new daily rider.   Some cheap retrospec wheels and crank, but I wanted to get back to riding before the summer is over.      Gg deal on injustice for ps4. 8.44.    What brake setup is that? Working on an old austro daimler and can't make up my mind on a lever.   Infamous looks the best, but wolfenstein is probably your best bet for a great game.   Pardon my ignorance, but what's the difference between surround speakers and regular bookshelf speakers?  I was looking at this setup. http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B009ZTGZOC?cache=bdf832dc73551381a6cc7b381b79eb7a#ref=s9_simh_gw_d0_g23_i2 pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER pf_rd_s=mobile-1 pf_rd_r=1NAKFZFDP8HYMSZJT9BC pf_rd_t=101 pf_rd_p=1634797062 pf_rd_i=507846  And was wondering if I eventually get towers if I could just use the surround speakers as rears. Edit: also I'm mostly gaming how are the fluances for generated audio rather than acoustic/reproduction.   The 5 HDMI inputs are not a deal breaker, but they are looking very good.  Bluetooth I can take or leave, it would be nice but my chromecast works just as well.  I've been told that Yamaha receivers have the least amount of technical problems, as well as the least amount of features.  Opposed to Denon with the most technical problems, but the most extra features.  Apparently Pioneer falls right in the middle.  (who knows how accurate my source was on that one though) Thanks for the input, I'm waiting for the towers to go on sale so I guess I will still keep shopping around on the best receiver to fit my needs.   Thinking about getting the new denon avr.s500bt with the Andrew Jones towers.  I need something under $500 that will sound good enough and will be worth expending into a 5.1 setup when I get more money.  I like the Denon, because it has 5xHdmi inputs and Bluetooth.  But I'm a little worried getting the lowest end model from any brand, are there any other receivers I should look into before pulling the trigger? And or any other comparable towers?  Thanks in advance.  Edit: I'm not an audiophile by any means,I just don't have great hearing and my tv speakers are starting to sound a bit tinny at higher volumes.   Diablo series always worked for me.enough of the mmo hooks with not nearly the grind or attention needed, or even give path of exile a shot.      Comme des fuck on op...   Thanks, Yah I was completely unaware.  First time buyer, thought these things were pretty much set in stone.   Thank you, really the money wasn't the issue.  I was hoping asking for a ridiculous amount of money would push the seller to just leave on the 24th.  I don't care if the seller is homeless for 2 days, it's better than me being homeless for 2 days.  If I have no grounds to ask for money and the seller just says no then I just look like an asshole and nothing changes.  I suppose putting together an itemized list would be more professional, and probably work out better in the end. Thanks again for your time and advice.   Two days is a big deal when now I need to rent a moving truck for 3 days instead of 1 just to store my stuff, I also need a place to store the moving truck because I wont have a driveway.  I also need to get hotel rooms for me and my mother.  Plus I need to pay a fee for canceling on my kitchen contractor with less than a weeks notice.  Also I have to take a docked day off of work as well because I'm giving less than 2 weeks notice.  Normally the agent has been very clear with me about everything, and explained document.  If he had any questions or needed to make any changes he gave me advanced notice as to what was happening next.  He sent me this last email with a subject stating "sign and return asap" and no body text.  Since emailing him back and saying "no" I have yet to hear from him.   I am buying a condo,  the terms of closing date were set about 3 months ago when we agreed upon a price.  Closing is supposed to be on Tuesday the 24th.  On Friday the 20th I received an email from the sellers agent with no explanation, just a docusign document trying to change the close date from the 24th to the 26th.  I'm guessing he was hoping I would sign without reading.  I sent him an email back saying I wouldn't sign, and when I talked to the bank lawyer about signing my closing documents I was told that the seller wasn't prepared to leave and needed to push the date back a few days.  I can understand that things happen, and if I was nicely asked rather than trying to trick me (the way I see it) I probably wouldn't be so miffed.  Do I have any ground to stand on in making demands?  If I were to say "I want the price to drop 1k for every day after the 24th" is that reasonable?  Sorry if this seems a little bit like a rant, but my childhood house is sold, my mother is moving across the country, and I'm stressed out enough as it is.  This was the last sort of stress I needed less than a week moving into my new place.   For 360-400 you can get a video card for a gaming pc.If that is your budget then get a ps4.If you have 1000+ to burn then get a gaming pc.   Devin the Dude, Cage (at one point, I havnt seen him since Hells Winter),  The Clipse was real fun.   I expected them to start testing payment models, but 2.99-4.99 for 4 hours. That's crazy.  I might, pay that price for a week.  It would price up with renting a video game from a video rental store.  Hopefully if no-one pays they will realize, it is beta after all.

 I can. I'm 28 years old I can say whatever I want.   I like to imagine all the marbles as being really excited they're at a theme park and running around going on rides.   I am happy now.   Those windshield wipers tho...      Volcanoes be making new urf on the reg, and ain't nobody steppin on that shit.      Congratulations you found the only error in a movie where Vin Diesel casually deadlifts a 2-ton up-armored car and then drives it off of one skyscraper into another, twice.   Pubic transportation.

Men who don't masturbate run the risk of having nocturnal emissions, getting their bedsheets pregnant, then nine months later, bam; a new pillowcase is born.

You can't see the NSA's dick pics, but they can see yours.   Chicks swallow millions of sperms all the time and they don't complain. You get one little fetus chunk in your mouth and you make a huge fuckin stink about it. Weak.   Heavyweights because fat people would bitch about it because they suck because they're fat.  	27
    Damn. It's amazing how little technical information about how it works there is about it. It's almost like they are hiding something.                           In regards to privacy there are two disappointing things about Apple:  1) that Apple was "suddenly" added to PRISM after Steve Jobs died. It's still not clear what PRISM exactly is and what kind of cooperation it needs from companies, but it does look that Steve Jobs was opposed to it and Tim Cook agreed to it. It's too much of a coincidence for the NSA to have gotten "PRISM access to Apple" right when Tim Cook became its CEO, even if you believe PRISM is just another NSA hacking program, and didn't require the companies' cooperation.  2) Even worse, Apple agreed to share Mac OS X/iOS zero-days with the DHS/NSA just so the government would start implementing Apple Pay for federal services - I mean what a sell-out! I refuse to believe they did it only because "they care about cybersecurity". Giving the NSA zerodays post-Snowden would mean either Apple is still incredibly naive, or stupid. Of course the NSA would use those Apple bugs offensively now. Seems like such a betrayal of its users.            Calling it an SSD is confusing. It's internal flash. Also devices like the Galaxy S6 are now starting to use the much faster (in write speed especially) UFS 2.0 standard, which microSD cards don't yet support and probably won't support for a while.  Also we may finally see F2FS supported in Android N (maybe even M, but seems unlikely) but that would only work with the internal storage. It most likely won't work with microSD cards if you still want them to work on Windows.  Microsoft will likely still be assholes about it and won't support F2FS in Windows, only so they can rent-seek Android OEMs for billions of dollars a year for the FAT32 patents - Excuse my anger, but it really pisses me off that Microsoft has the nerve to charge royalty just so devices can work with their own OS. Imagine if Google and Samsung charged accessory makers for making accessories that work with Android phones.   I sure hope they do, especially with Project Vault coming along. It would be silly to not be able to use Vault with a Nexus device. Wouldn't they need to test it on one of their own devices anyway?                                 What in "fake companies" don't you understand?  They weren't legitimate businesses. And if they were essentially "FBI contractors", then I'm okay to having them outed. It's even worse that the FBI hires 3rd parties to spy on people than if they did it themselves, because now you have 3rd parties having access to that information as well. And stingrays can collect conversations from *millions* of people.   It would've needed to support the Vulkan API out of the gate to get "console-like" low-level performance anyway. But considering this is for 2016, it could've probably been supported (by whoever would provide the GPU for the console).  A Tegra X2 or something similar would offer Xbox One-like performance and Nintendo could sell it for $150 (obviously subsidized by games, like all the major consoles are).   Not cool.            It's the Russians spying on us!   No, it's the Chinese!  Oh, it's just our own FBI. Carry on, then!                  I'd be surprised if they announced they didn't support it.               [Who?](https://freakoffandom.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/gog_9.png)   Bad Idea (tm).   Just stick with 7.                     Yes. Unfortunately, unlike say Google, the carriers have completely immunity for what they give to the NSA (thanks to a law passed around 2005 I think). So they are much more likely to "cooperate" with the NSA, whatever that means - even if it's *against* the law (remember they have immunity...).  So having the carriers keep it really isn't *significantly* better.                              You know how I can already "abuse" that? By keeping my Wi-Fi/4G off while I use apps that don't need the Internet for anything but to show ads.  Why doesn't *everyone* do that with apps then? Because it's too much of a hassle. Just as allowing users to block ads through the Internet permission setting would be.   This is so you don't disable the Internet permission to block ads.   For the developer, not the user. I certainly don't consider analytics as a "feature" that needs to be forced upon users. At the very least make it opt-out. Not mandatory.         It's been obvious Erdogan is a dictator for some time.   Can we use other example than "child porn"? We often criticize the government for using the "child porn" argument to pass new draconic laws, yet here we are using "child porn" as the "worst possible example" to make a point about something.   The same thing used to be true with WP in the past. People saw animations loading for 2 seconds in-between actions and were thinking "wow, WP is *fast*", when what they really meant is WP is "smooth".   And 90% of it will be back on Tuesday thanks to the USA Freedom Act. 'Murrica!                   Sen. Dan Coats pretty much says that the American public is not being spied upon and that would require a conspiracy of people who would keep their mouths shut about it...  Lol, yeah...kind of like the NSA?                     Maybe if we're talking about something like [E-CAT](http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/191754-cold-fusion-reactor-verified-by-third-party-researchers-seems-to-have-1-million-times-the-energy-density-of-gasoline]). Then I would agree. If we're talking about even "truck-sized reactors" like what Lockheed is planning or even bigger than that - then no.   These kind of stories are kind of hit pieces. I mean they aren't really *false*, just disingenuous. Renewables and such technology *should* get subsidies, at least for the first decade or so, and until fossil fuel stops get subsidies, too.   Until fossil fuels continue to get subsidies you can't say it's "not fair" that renewable stuff gets subsidies. If we're talking what would happen in an *ideal* world is renewables not getting any subsidies, but fossil fuels getting *taxed* extra for the damage they cause to the planet (suffice to say no subsidies either for them).   Not with that attitude. I don't think Android will fail because Samsung gave up on it. Samsung will take the road of Nokia if it gives up Android.   It just means Google needs to have access to those drivers, the way Windows does. Windows works on thousands of different hardware configurations, too (think about all the keyboards, mice, HDDs, SSDs, CPUs, GPUs, monitors, motherboards and so on).   That is the price everyone pays when they buy a laptop with Windows installed. Thats why I'm so glad to live in a country where Microsoft doesn't force OEMs to put Windows on all notebooks, and you can actually buy notebooks without Windows.   It seems to sit somewhere between Google's normal products and "Google X" products.  If regular products take around 2 years to get to mainstream users, Google X take about 10 years, then ATAP probably take around 5 years.   Really looking forward to Project Vault. Cheap Hardware Secure Modules for everyone? Sign me up!   Whatever the government understands by "cybersecurity" it sure doesn't seem to be what everyone else understands by it.                           NSA.   Shhhh!   Obviously we can't know *right now*, since it's not out yet. We'll know for sure when M is out and then we can probably easily check for it against Whatsapp or even TextSecure, and see if Google Now "knows" what you're talking about.  The reason I said "likely" is because Google Now probably reads the data *from the screen*, and last I checked TextSecure or virtually all apps didn't encrypt the data as it's displayed on the screen. If that's how Google does it then it *should* be able to read the data for all apps, regardless of their encrypted at rest or through the network.  Also, as the above comment mentions developers *actually have to opt-out of it* through that flag, which also implies it can read all apps' data.   Not the OS, Google's central servers a.k.a the NSA (once it hacks those servers).  The issue is that instead of having "decentralized spying" (on each app), they can just hack the one service that "spies" on all the other apps from your phone.   Still scary that it's essentially *opt-out*. How many Android developers will know to use that? How many users will be aware that the apps they are using don't have that flag enabled?  The developers actually have to be pro-actively aware of the assist API even though their app might have nothing to do with it otherwise, and then know to set that flag.   I'm sure that has played a big reason, but I think another one was security. SD cards aren't very secure in general. And you also couldn't (really) use them to store apps before, and many OEMs tended to add like 512-2GB of internal storage in their phones in the earlier years, and then add a microSD slot and tell you that you have "up to 32GB of extra storage". Maybe Google was trying to promote bigger amounts of internal storage over the microSD slot cop-out from some OEMs.  Either way, I think they mentioned that for Android M you can "adopt" SD cards as internal storage (probably in a secure way), so we might see Google advocate the use of SD cards again. Who knows, the next Nexus devices might even feature SD card slots.               http://ipfs.io/ is another interesting project.         But drastically reduce their *bandwidth* costs, which I'm sure is the (much) bigger cost. Storage is cheap.            I'm pretty sure they booted it before, too.   Yes, but as usually is the case with Google, it will happen several years after the "right time to do it", and they'll probably have to catch up with Apple, Microsoft, etc on that front, even though they could've *led* in that.   Talk here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpbWQbkl8_g feature=youtu.be t=2851   I bet Oculus wishes it was acquired by Google rather than Facebook riiight about now.   Google Now on top makes Google collect all the data from all those apps, including private messages.   I really don't understand why Google imposed the 16MP cap. Just because *most* high-end phones are capped at that right now? So what? Camera resolution increases like every year at the high-end. Will they announce a 20MP bump next year? Why not just do it now? Or just say "full resolution" and be done with it. It's just a weird decision considering it would've probably had a *minor* impact on Google's storage load, but it would've been so great if people didn't have to think about that limitation.  It's also disappointing they can't store raw.   In English I assume.                     They *could* make the argument that it's not their fault. It's not that different from self-driving cars, which are autonomous. Who goes to prison if a self-driving car kills someone?   Really? With the current government that the US has and with the virtually unaccountable spy agencies? You think there will be a "strict oversight" for who gets killed by the robots?   The machine can kill many more and it's tireless.  It's the same argument of targeted spying vs mass automated spying.  By the way, mass automated spying is very ineffective at catching terrorists, because there are [too many false positives](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2005/03/why_data_mining_wont.html) - just like there would be with automated killing machines. Except in their cases, "false positives" means killing orders of magnitude more innocents than guilty.   Algorithms are more like "processes" than "orders". In a war the orders can change very quickly. You won't be able to change the algorithms with a very high accuracy quickly.  Going to war with an algorithm is like going into the war following Sun Tzu's book and expecting to win.   You really believe "Strong AI" wouldn't be controlled, at least in the first few decades by the government? I mean in the sense that the government will still modify its programs to "think a certain way" or obey it.  It's unlikely the strong AI will be "No, Obama! You're stupid...that human doesn't deserve to be killed!"  Come on, I know this is r/futurology but let's not be *too* naive.   What are the "right parameters" anyway? Are they decided based on phone metadata like it's decided now? (the humans just pull the trigger).   Except, you know..."national security" and "classified".  To how many documents from CIA's drone kills can you get access now?  My guess is the CIA will start using such autonomous robots to kill people at least a few years before it becomes public.                                                                                 You never go full ~~retard~~ Orwell!   Not very clear at all. Google is being super cryptic about *how it actually works*.  Even the "it creates a virtual card number" thing may not be *exactly* like Apple's, because Google Wallet used to create "virtual numbers" too. But there's no way to know because there are no real details on it. Google is being very annoying, both with the keynote and even more so with this blog post, where this sort of details should exist.   KitKat+ (with PIN, probably). M+ (fingerprint, PIN).                  Yeah, call the cops they said. They will help you, they said:  http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/28/man-calls-suicide-line-police-kill-him.html   They are completely shameless about it. They don't even care about the public's opinion anymore.                  You're thinking of it from the perspective of them always doing everything right and *just this one time* making this "mistake" which seems dumb and shouldn't have happened.  Except that's not how it works. It's more like they almost *always* gather evidence through less than legal means and then either do or don't use parallel construction before they present it in Court, depending on whether they think the judge will catch on or not.   From that perspective, and if they have say a 95% success rate in doing that, it doesn't seem quite as dumb, because the reward/risk ratio is very high. Plus, they get used to doing things the "easy way".  It's basically why they also prefer using Stingrays without warrants all the time, too, and even trick judges into thinking the devices aren't nearly as intrusive as they are, when needed.               With iris technology that can already identify you from [40 feet away](http://news.discovery.com/tech/gear-and-gadgets/iris-scanner-identifies-a-person-40-feet-away-150410.htm), we should expect the government has "our irises" already and therefore it's not a safe technology for authenticating to mobile devices or services.  At least fingerprints (especially ultrasonic 3D ones) are a little harder to collect from online photos or from everywhere you've been. Faces/irises should be much easier to collect from online photos and public/airport cameras.                        So ugh, this is a very complex issue so I suggest everyone reads the article before they make up their minds. It's a great article.  Ultimately, you know a law is bad when it doesn't apply equally to everyone. I always like to say that if it doesn't apply to those in power as well (or the rich), then the law *should not exist*. Take the drug laws. They always seem to affect the poorest of the people the most, yet actors or other rich people get to go to "stress clinics" when caught. If drugs are so terrible they need harsh punishments then why don't they apply equally to everyone?  But returning to this issue, this treaty not only *allows* the NSA (and the rest of the Five Eyes nations) to keep buying zero-days from those same "evil hackers" the the treaty is meant to stop, but it actually *forces* good security researchers to share their zero-days exploits with the NSA (kind of how [Apple](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/02/12/obama-to-sign-executive-order-on-cybersecurity-threats/) has agreed to do recently voluntarily and how Microsoft has been doing it for a [long time](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-06-14/u-s-agencies-said-to-swap-data-with-thousands-of-firms)), so the NSA can exploit them themselves. So from the get-go the treaty is a *farce*.  Also, here's another strong argument for why this shouldn't pass. It wants to stop hackers from selling exploits to China but give them to the US, right? That creates a terrible incentive for the US in terms of (actual) cyber-security.   The US already barely cares about "cyber-security", despite its claims and chest-beating that it does. What it really means is it cares about passing new surveillance laws and new ways to hack people's computers. That's not cyber-security.  But as long as China and others keep attacking your bad security defense, it will have no choice but to *start caring* about security defense as well. And it has already started doing that lately, by starting to switch all federal websites to HTTPS for instance.  Now, if this treaty passes, then the US will feel once again too comfortable for its own good in terms of security defense. Not only that, but now that the US would get to have many more zero-days in its arsenal than "rival nations", or even most of those in the 41 Wassenaar nations, since only the Five Eyes seem to be exempt from it, then it will *want* most software to keep remaining vulnerable.  So despite the theoretical "good" that this treaty could do, we already know it will only make NSA spying and hacking much worse. That's reason enough to oppose this.   Kind of like the graphene announcements.  I kid.   Call them: https://www.fight215.org/   Is the new Go client also compatible with Go 1.5, or do you plan to do that in the future? (to be able to use a Go compiler as well).         Many people, especially in poorer countries are getting *first* familiarized with Android and may not even know what Windows is until many years later (if ever). It would be very smart of Google to take advantage of that by "upselling" them to Android laptops, too with an interface that makes sense for the desktop of course.   Too many people think that Android has to look *just like on the phone* on the desktop - and then they inevitably think "Android on desktop would suck!". That's not true. The interface can (and should) be optimized for the desktop.   Android on the desktop may not be as "feature rich" as Windows, but if people like Chrome OS, then Android on the destop could be "Chrome OS on steroids".   Also, Android should have another *major* advantage over Windows: touch optimized apps. If people are first introduced to "touch apps", then they will want to use touch apps *in all situations*. Android laptops would make that a very natural progression.      So Israel doesn't want to recognize Palestine as a state because of US involvement not because of Netanyahu? Yeah, that makes sense.     	200
 I wish my D D group had females :(   [relevant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=4m2WutlqBk0#t=56s)   was?   Ultimate Spider-Man is my favorite too. The game-play and music were good and it felt awesome playing as Venom. I was a huge fan of the comics, but I haven't read them since Ultimatum.   Boy Meets World?   Here's an episode where they go inside the girls bathroom and the walls are pink, and there is a couch. http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=kudFmxVoLFU#t=328s   independent contractors too      Omg. I've been searching for the name of this game for nearly 9 years. Thank you.   I actually started playing it again this weekend, and it still plays good :)   I haven't heard about this. But I doubt it.   Who knows, in the future it might see the light of day. Personally, I hope after GTAV they start working on Bully 2, if one of their studios hasn't started yet.  Edit: Sorry for the redundant title in the second sentence. I copy and pasted.       I'm replaying The Warriors. It's still awesome. I wish Rockstar did make that spiritual sequel I heard about.   "you're tearin' me apart!"   Play the game Bully, by Rockstar. I always feel better after beating up some punk kids.   I'm going to say Drawing too. I can write stories, but I think it would be better to tell them with visuals, like a comic.   You would think since the brain is more developed it would be easier. But is it easier to learn your first language as a kid because your brain is still developing?      oh i just noticed that   I've done this too many times....      I like Abrams, but Star Trek and Star Wars are one thing, 2001 is another.   The thing. I love Big Trouble in Little China, the same goes for Kurt Russell and John Carpenter, but i think it's meh.      Without Kubrick.... I'm sorry, Meow_Goes_The_Kitten. I'm afraid I can't let you do that.    For me its kids who die driving drunk or texting while driving. I just cant feel sorry for people who do stupid stuff like that.       You have some pretty good points.   I always do this, and It keeps reminding me of Taxi Driver.      Really?   Come on man, we have to survive!   ?   Oh that's one too many, I'm sorry but you got to cut one loose. Unless you want to go....   Family, friends, celebrities, whoever.  	35
 In The Loop has pretty pedestrian cinematography, but that film is all about its script. And that was one fucking great script.   That's a good article. Although one point I'd like to add is that George Miller, John Seale and Margaret Sixel storyboarded, shot and edited the film to achieve total spatial clarity in Fury Road's action sequences. Whereas spatial clarity in Ultron seems like more of an afterthought to the dialogue and character development Joss Whedon was focusing on. Like it was something that could be done almost solely in post.  	2
 If miller's world has so much gravity that it distorts time so much, how can they all even stand?   Teamviewer. Free remote desktop connection, and they have a mobile app, so you can control your pc from your phone. I spent a lot of money on building a nice desktop, and just remote to it from a cheap netbook or my android phone whenever I need it. Teamviewer is probably the most important free software I've ever used! The app has come a long way, I find the interface extremely logical and easy to use, you can also transfer files and it's just the best.      Maybe you bumped into them on a plane. Or maybe you went to college with them before they made it big. Proof gets mad ups.   Wow that's really rough, my heart goes out to you mate  	5
 What if you make it so that the rebel leader kills the civilians,making it look as if the agents did it?It would buff up the rebels morale,and add depth to the short   Bro,girl to the left is mia lina,atleast if my memory still serves me well   After 2 years of casually playing team fortress 2,i gave it a try to actually play seriously,and not for fun...Truth be told,it was quite interesting thinking about the game for the first time and developing harder strategies.   Must say,thats pure crap from them.   I think i should have gotten them already,but there are no points in sight.Also,maybe that was US only?   My GT is Dr Von Foster,feel free to add me if you want to play some times :) I have Halo reach,Halo 4,Fable 2,MK vs DC,Dead Island,All those free games from Live and Forza 3.Of course,we can all just always play happy wars :)   Ah i see.In serbian it litteraly translates to bottom,like the bottom of a pit,rather than down.But given the context,i see how they use it   A windrunner waving to a drow ranger,which is facepalming due to...windrunner being extremely 'interesting'   http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Flag_Blank.svg there you go :)   By far the best Windrunner response http://www.dota2wiki.com/images/0/0e/Wind_attack_06.mp3   doesnt dno() stand for bottom?Might mean as in bottom tier player,as far as i know   No,sorry   629   Hya all!Keys are preffered,im not looking for eggs nor greevils,and try to offer on this thread,but Pming is cool too.Cheers!   Hey its cool bro,good luck   Interested in tf2 or dota items?Or magicka?   Sony trinitron...is that the one with big speakers on left and right ends?I think i used to own one   Got the Kimono of the Ebony Tower,What would you offer for it?   Hey man,random question,whats the going price for a soul reaper?Just dropped for me and i have no idea what to sell it for   Ill take the bb deal,never really have the time to use those honestly.Add me   Whats your price on each of them?   For what?Also got a random add from a person offering 2 eggs for my Call of dendrochreon,was i right to turn that offer down?   Hya!So im looking mostly for eggs,but id also like if someone could tell me what their common price is.Also everything is free to go and up for trade,just offer me here before adding on steam.Im going to sleep now,ill check out the offers in the morning.Cheers!  http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordLuka7/inventory/   Dude.Crimson dlc is 6v6   Doctor Von Foster Natural Selection 2 Happy holidays mate :)   you happen to be trading/giving away some of those?    Great,thanks for answering so quickly   So during diretide,i have recieved an egg and didnt infuse it with any essences.After some time,i have forgotten about it,eventually leading to its expiration.So my question is,do the eggs still drop im game like in diretide?And are there any specific ways to get them,like winning the greeviling(didnt prove as such for now) if yes? Thanks in advance,Doc   I got a call of the dendochreon for furion just a couple of minutes ago from a nice gift.Furion being my all time favorite hero,this made my day!      Hey man,you interested in trading your keys for metal?    Well it mostly depends really.Its not a mistake using either,good luck with your purschase :)   Nah,sorry im only looking for metal.Plus as far a i read on the spreadheet,its 3 ref   I have a genuine war head.Does that change the price?  	34
 Can you please add the Seabrook Star?      Was the best part of filming Joe Dirt working with Kid Rock, or inspiring millions?      How has the success of Gone Girl affected your writing habits? Has anything changed now that you don't have to be concerned with your finances?   Hey Romanski how proud are you being from NH? Probably my greatest achievement.   Ernest Cline's Ready Player One.    Junot Diaz            I've always attended the interactive sessions, so I can't speak to the music. That being said there seems to be a give and take with the popularity of these festivals. They are becoming larger and more intricate, which takes away from the grass roots feel of the whole thing, but also moves them towards bigger acts and more legitimacy.   Plus even at interactive the music is still killer.         Clay, I'll be attending your talk with Emily Parker this evening at the New America Foundation. How do you know Mrs. Parker and what are your thoughts on the possible balkanization of the Internet?      I have a Lenova laptop, plugged into a Lenova docking station, which is hooked up to a Dell monitor (VGA to VGA). I recently picked up a Lenova monitor. I would like to use the docking station to have dual monitors, but the only other port is a DVI-D and the monitor has a VGA port.   I ordered an adapter (VGA to DVI-D) and it didn't work. I did some trouble-shooting, and both monitors, chords, and ports work. This leads me to believe that it's the adapter's fault, but before I order a new one I'm curious if there's something I'm missing. My IT team tells me that the video card, comp, and docking station support dual-monitors.    Depends on experience and writing. Do you have any writing samples?   I'm in the process of rolling out a new tech-oriented website with a focus on futurism. I would like to hold an open discussion about how technology is effecting out culture; think "the future of optometry in a world of Google Glass" or "Snapchat is mocking your privacy; here's why you don't care." I'm open to most topics, but I"m looking specifically for beat writers to cover drones, wearables, and 3d printing.   Message me if this is of interest to you and I can share more details.       I can't help but feel that open systems are dominating the market right now, and that any desirable closed system is being cannibalized by open source software anyway. More curious than anything else.       Congratulations. As someone who works in publishing, this is no small feat. However I have to warn you, the hard part is just beginning.   	23
 ah, wish I could help. I don't know what's available around there. I've heard of sovernet and vtel as providers, you could look them up. Not sure if Fairpoint serves there, but their service is hit-or-miss depending on where (ie. you exact house location relative to their equipment) you live.   depends on where you live.   Oh man...that worries me. If an offensive lineman isn't motivated by the guy lining up across from him bent on ripping apart the guy he's paid to protect then he'll never be motivated. No amount of money or yelling would do it. Change of scenery...well we'll see I guess.   This helps us how? Another mediocre guy for defenses to humiliate on their short journey to Tannehill.   Mike Sherman is not the problem.  1) Tannehill hands the ball to the Bills for a TD on the first drive, then fumbles for them in the 4th quarter when we had the lead. 2) Our o-line lets more guys in than a cheap hooker. Yesterday's "improved" o-line performance (measuring sacks) was a mask. Tannehill was able to buy more time by rolling out and we ran better, but they did not play better.  It's really easy to call out coaches as the problem, but you don't know what play was called, when Tannehill audibled out, how they prepared...do you expect Sherman to suit up and play tackle? Or run on the field and stop Tannehill's occasional bad decision?   I've been playing the game just fine on windows 8, but it constantly crashes on 8.1. Googling shows others with similar issues.   Be warned.    Thanks for the suggestion, I'll take a look at Roku!   I want to get something to play digital movies I have on a hard drive on my TV (I've tried Plex through my blu-ray and for some reason it always craps out after about 45 minutes).  Any experience with the below? Other recommendations?  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XVBAKI/ref=s9_wish_gw_d98_g23_ir03?ie=UTF8 colid=3TQMIRNINX5I2 coliid=IOGBZQZWD5HFT pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER pf_rd_s=center-2 pf_rd_r=1XWC4QAXE16F4RCAR8MA pf_rd_t=101 pf_rd_p=1630072222 pf_rd_i=507846   Taking away from EMDs is speculation. After the most recent Penguin update I'm seeing multiple reports of EMDs rebounding.   I just had to totally furnish my place (divorce sad face). I found Willie D's to have good deals on some quality stuff.  Ashley Furniture too depending on your price range.   Latoya?   awesome! needs to be compiled into a wallpaper...maybe a project for the weekend.   Like farts?   Should have guessed it was you since the pose was so on.   Definitely post your film!   Good job dude. I like your concept, and your hunter buddy has a great stance!   Where can I stream this with decent quality?      Such a good movie.    Awesome! Love to hear that! These players deserve that support.   I feel like the Phins have played better teams than the Pats (and we've been on the road), and with us both at 3-0 it'll be good to see how the Pats do against the Falcons next week.   I'm sure the dirty birds will be pissed too.   Awesome to hear! I hope that all those people experiencing a great win will mean more will return for future games.   Ditto. I'm stuck in New England. If I was around Miami I'd have season tickets.   I haven't heard noise like that from the Dolphins stadium since Marino!   Cool! Please share your final! :)   Them holding hands makes it a bromance movie.   UVM alumn here. I drive by that spot often. Apparently not at the right times.   Been there. Confront him in public, in front of his friends. Be fearless.    1,2,3,4. You know what I mean.    Crappy quality.    Thanks for the detail!   Hi reddit.  I want to paint a wall in my new place and there are large screw holes (where material is actually protruding out) and a few holes that look like their were filled with some cement like material -- where the cement is not flush but again protruding out.  Pictures: http://imgur.com/a/kl8Iz  What's the best way to fix these? Probably a noob question, but I'm a noob to this kind of stuff.  Thanks for any help!  oh, and I'm in New England (U.S.)   Introduce yourself and ask people about themselves. Get them talking, people love talking about themselves.   There's an expression that I use to my advantage "being interested is interesting".     It was called "Puppy Go Home." A card game I would play with my Dad where the rules would change based on the cards I had. I always won, go figure.   Good points.  As you were.   It's not against balance, you just may not understand the rest of the mod. Good players can dead stop a hunter (I can the majority of the time on standard servers), and great ones can cut a smoker's tongue before being wrapped in it (I have a tougher time with that one).  Play on evilmania's servers and you'll see what I mean. Infected teams can select the special infected they want to be (can't duplicate an infected without spending points that are collected by playing) and Survivors can purchase weapons or health. It's not for everyone, but if you've been playing for a while and are fairly skilled it adds another level of strategy.   Nice!   The Browns home opener?   You shouldn't quit just because your team isn't doing well.   Sounds like you were on a modded server.    Your girlfriend does for me.    Whoa whoa whoa!  Before this gets all ugly in here let's get something very clear. They're called "Caucasians".   and now it's down :(   someone upload it!   Agreed. Great character development. Hulk had heart.    Kind of like Seinfeld for me. He just IS funny. He could recite a recipe for Mexican wedding cakes and I'd laugh.    Turkey I assume.    Moving to the noosk Friday. What have I done!   The average person eats 8 spiders a year.    I'll try that some day. Thanks!   I saw that movie for a different reason. Dat ass.    No fucking way.  No.  Fucking.  Way.   You use up more ammo that way.   Just get better at aiming :)   I'm a simple man with simple tastes. Nothing beats an Old El Paso taco dinner kit. So, for restaurant tacos I like Moes and Chipotle, but if you are searching for "true" Mexican then look elsewhere.    I see the tree of life.  Conspiracy?   Agreed on the Browns game.  The first few games are scary. But...with this team, with so many being new and Philbin having their trust, if they won 3 of the first 4 games they would be a confident bunch, and that would make them dangerous.   So what you're saying is there's a chance? Nice!   What are the chances of the Mini (the NFC phone) coming with, or being available at an extra charge, in the US for the Max?   Let's get a list going of the places to sell domain names.  **sedo.com and afternic.com** are both marketplaces where you can sell domain names at retail. Escrow is available through these.  **namepros.com** is a domain name forum that has a section for sales; however, generally these are not end users purchasing, but other domainers, and so the price you'll get will be at a step discount. Note that the buy/sell process is outside of the forum so use escrow to protect yourself during the transaction.  **tobyclements.com** is a broker who deals with premium domains. He handles the transaction and takes 20%. You send him names that you are interested in selling along with your asking price (he'll reject if you don't include a price) and he uses his network to help sell. Often these are not end users, so you may not get top-dollar, but he does work with companies or individuals who will be end-users who are looking for the right domain.  **ebay.com** is really hit-or-miss for domains. Your listing would have to be viewed by someone interested in that industry/niche specifically. It is possible to sell on ebay, and many domainers have, but there seems to be quite a bit of luck involved.   Hi redditors!  I have taken over r/domainnames and would like to know what you would like to see from this subreddit.  I'm open to ideas, but a few of mine are below: * Industry news. * Premium names for sale (keyword-rich .com, .net, .org). I don't want this to get spammy, so possibly these go to a moderation queue if that's possible (I'll look into). * Questions on domaining as a hobby or business. * Success stories, case studies. * Domain names   SEO  I've been dabbling in domain name buying/selling for many years and so can help others, though I'd like to see more users here to assist each other. I also have a lot of experience in SEO, and so can answer questions that pertain to domains in relation to that discipline.  Domaining can be really fun. Finding that diamond either not registered or about to be released and flipping is a lot like real estate with many of the same principles applying.  train_subject4065   Yeah!  Thanks :)   Jesus! 22lb cat on your back in a bar, are you sure you don't want to make the front page?   Cat in a backpack sounds like instant karma.   Could do a bar that's in a restaurant, like vt pub   brewery.    There was one a couple of months ago, and yes it's allowed :)  I'm up for another.  This time I say we make a rule that no drifters with backpacks full of rotisserie chicken are allowed! Not that he wasn't a nice guy...   Reposts. Get over it.   The narc is watching this reddit closely. It's down already.   Twice on Tuesdays.    Same with Super Bowl wins. This is the ultimate team sport, it takes more than a QB to win it.    I lump them together. My understanding is how they respond is a part of the director AI. If not my bad.   I think it's terrible. Playing single player, or online with a bot on your team, is horrible. In fact I'd say single player is not worth playing on the hardest setting because of how bad the AI is. I've literally lay dying on the ground with the bots standing around me doing nothing at all, not even picking me up.   I just consider them extra health packs, they aren't worth anything more.   I can't be of any help...but this brought back some nostalgia. I played this in high school and college. So much fun! I'd put in dark movie soundtracks and turn off the lights. Those were the days!   If you don't mind, please report back on your choice and outcome. I may be moving to Winooski and was wondering the same thing.  Fairpoint sucks where I am now, rumor is that there are places where Fairpoint isn't bad, and considering there's a Fairpoint building right in Winooski I had hopes...   Thanks.  Sorry for not  posting specs, but really wasn't about that as much as if it could even be upgraded. I've bought desktops in the past that were just impossible to upgrade.   I need a good starting point for a desktop pc (some gaming) but want to make sure it's one that I can upgrade later (graphics card, processor, for example).  Any one know if the ASUS M51 can be upgraded easily?  Thanks.   Am I the only one old enough to remember the generic store brand products like this 30 years ago?     Subreddits...get your mind out of the gutter.    I'll show you mine if you show me yours.   Literally faster to use Sprint 3g, which is the laughing stock of mobile data.   http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnlzhmlbYX1qafrh6.gif   We don't have kiosks to purchase tickets (that I know of) up here.  Glad to hear it's working for you. When my finances are more settled I may subscribe.   That's generous of you. I've done that on their website, but it's unclear if they only look for theaters that take Discover, or if they've somehow confirmed their card is accepted.  My zip is 05401 though.   But whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?  	79
             You do sound like my history prof.  Mr. Higgins, is that you? Log in, please.    Jeez, who says I can't do that as long as the source per se is indicated?   The source's indicated at the bottom of the graphics           	10
 I liked the comments, especially this one  This par for the course with this new generation we are in big trouble, they dont care about what the government is doing to this country. We have a lot to say being a former Marine , on my surprise about so much disrespect of the generation behind us. We as citizens and Veterans have to protect our memorials , we need to police them and make sure they are not destroyed or defaced for any reason. If we do catch or observe anybody Doing any thing to our memories we will deal with them ourselves.   I think every generation thinks the ones below it are the worst people to pop out of a vagina.   I agree with your suggestions don't agree that he can't be black.  I also don't think Elba would fit, but that's more because I think the role is for someone with a suave confident demeanor.  Elba to me or at least the characters I'm familiar with him playing are more a restrained aggressiveness ready to be unleashed, if that makes any sense.   I thought you were taxed based on where you played not who you played for.  So playing for the Dolphins their would be 8 home games that would be tax free and if you played away at Houston that would be tax free.  But if you played New England or Buffalo you'd pay those states taxes.   Yeah, I thought that sounded like a solid turnout.  I couldn't do that with the internet today!   The smell was so horrible.  I tried to get a gif of the maggots crawling all over it as we scooped it up and put it in the bag but my cohort was too quick for me.   Damn I guess people didn't like your comment   Oh you...   Then I guess I die?  Not sure, I swim with friends so hopefully they could save me.  Shit happens, can't prevent every single possible scenario that might kill me?      Because most of us can swim and a life jacket is very cumbersome.  If I'm tubing or wake boarding or jet skiing then yes a life jacket makes sense.  But if I'm chilling on a 24 footer it isn't as necessary.   Agreed   I believe  I believe our fans don't understand the rules  	12
 [Here's the link](http://society6.com/Maazcon/Chemistry-Hjg_Print#1=2) to it! I just set it up on my society6 account.   WAIT IT'S MY CAKE DAY?  oh^and^thank^you..   I turned it into the two BrBa subreddits I visit most frequently. It's awesome to hear you saw that post too. Thank you!   Thank you. I want to see how it looks, by the way!   That puts my mind to a lot of rest. I've been obsessed with Yoji Shinkawa. He's the kind of artist i don't think anyone can ever accurately emulate. I feel lucky even to be close enough to give him a subtle homage.    **EDIT 2:** [Here's a link to my Society6 account](http://society6.com/Maazcon/Chemistry-Hjg_Print#1=2) for those that want to purchase it. I updated the work so it doesn't have my artist info anymore. I'm still looking for a vendor through where I can hopefully make it more affordable for you guys, so if anyone knows of a good one, let me know! Don't hesitate to send me a message if you have any questions about purchases either. If you guys just want to check out some more stuff I tend to post online, [here's my portfolio](http://mconpictures.com)  **EDIT:** I'm still not really awake at the moment because of the all-nighter I just pulled earlier, so this might all come out a bit weird. This is the first time that one of my artworks has gotten this much recognition and feedback, so I'm still in a phase of "HOLY SHIT" right now.   I know that r/breakingbad implemented rules for artwork to be diverted to another subreddit. Since the mods do say they "may make an exception" for certain works, I wanted to take a shot at it, but this is honestly more than I could have asked for.   For those of you asking about purchasing it, I want to try making that doable. I'll try having something set up by the end of today. I want to make sure it's in a good enough quality to be printed first, so I'm going to work on sorting that out. I do have a society6 account, but if anyone knows of another similar way to sell artwork online, let me know. I like society6, but I don't know how I feel about the prices. I want you guys to be able to buy it affordably, so I'll take the best route I can find to do that.  Seriously, the fact that there's people out there that want to own something I worked on myself is still something I'm trying to comprehend. Thanks again, everyone.   **Original post:** Yo, guys. I don't know how to say it, but thank you for the response to this, the criticism, everything. I uploaded this after finishing a 10 page essay and this is insane to wake up to after a sad attempt at two hours of sleep before class. I just keep refreshing the page right now because I honestly didn't think this would be getting hits or generating discussion at all that quickly.    I promise i'll be responding to each one of you personally when i get out of class because you guys made my morning a lot less stressful. I feel too grateful. Thanks for all the feedback!       The bulk of this was drawing Walter digitally.  I had renditions done first of him in every form of appeareance he took on. What ended up in this was mainly full on Heisenberg and Mr. Lambert. The coloration came afterward, and then I messed around (and perhaps got carried away) with layering it and distorting it from different angles. I've been obsessing over Metal Gear Solid artwork for a while now, so this got my graphic novel/cyberpunk inspiration running wild.    Thank you so much, by the way!         Calm down, guys. Let's not start any treble here.       This all seems like it's about to come down to a conflict between Jesse, Hank, and Walter. I think the [painting](http://i.imgur.com/LAOANQ1.png) at Hank's house is about to show significance.   This is absolutely heartbreaking.   guys its the internet      If the CGI looks even just as good as it does here, I'll be sold on this approach to the big guy. It's a difficult task finding a way to bring the iconic "man in suit" look Godzilla's had for over 50 years, and working it into a movie that has to appeal to audiences in an age of high-budget sci-fi films focused mostly on computer generated VFX.   I'm 21, so I'm only a student right now. But besides my parents, our entire extended family lives overseas, so I get to visit places near in and near the Middle East every three years or so. This was my first time visiting Saudi Arabia, however.   Honestly, I'm incredibly lucky and fortunate to even have the chance to visit those places. I'm thankful that I get to see my cousins as often as I get to.   Mecca. In Saudi Arabia. It's connected to a hotel and directly faces Masjid Al-Haram, which is known as the holiest Islamic landmark in the world.   Yes sir. '05.   It'd be awesome if you guys put up screenshots of what they look like on your phone, by the way. I love the fact that other people out there like my work enough to want to keep it as a background. I'll have more for you guys soon!   Right on! Took it from a parking garage near the Riverwalk.    Got it taken care of. That picture was from a month or so back. I put together a new one just to ease everyone's mind, hah   ...except for the SRS light. That's next week.   http://imgur.com/U0QvgtF.jpg   I do! The handle is @maazcon.    This is pretty much a subreddit for all mobile wallpapers. Not just iPhones.   As a PSA for everyone, get your hands on VSCO Cam right now if you can as well. They're giving it for free because of a new update, and they have a promotional cut from $16 to $6 going on for their entire IAP bundle. It's worth shelling out the money for. The best results for me came from that app. Afterlight's been my go to editing app for a long time as well. Both are awesome.   Glad to hear they look good so far! I'm on a jailbreak and waiting for the OS to be finalized before I get it, so I was a bit nervous about how the pictures would look on iOS 7. I can't wait to see how they came out on the parallax.   I don't mind at all! You can use my twitter handle if you'd like. @drcon   If you're losing interest in your own work, then you know you've been staring at them too long on your own by now. You don't even really need Reddit to start with. Show them to close friends. Post them on your social networking profiles. Feedback from good friends, family and anyone around you is a big step forward.   Making a website to build a portfolio out of them once you've really learned a few techniques and have a few sets of photos to work off of comes later on. Post them to reddit for feedback and criticism, whereever appropriate.  [r/photography](http://reddit.com/r/photography) has some great links to tips and guides on building on your work, if you want to check it out.   Thank you guys tremendously for the feedback. I'm glad to know that these were pretty well received. I'll try putting together another set in the coming few weeks!   Sure thing, man! This isn't really iPhone sized, but it is my favorite shot I've taken of the skyline. Let me know if you want me to size it for an iPhone.   http://i.imgur.com/bB53HqP.jpg   I mainly use Afterlight and VSCO Cam.  Get your hands on VSCO Cam right now if you can.

The best results for me came from that app.  Afterlight is great too, if you want a fast, clean, and cheap editing program. It works great with Instragram.   I take them because I like taking them. I tried doing photography as a job, but then it just made me hate it so I stopped. Now I just carry my phone with me and capture anything I find worth shooting, and i love it. It becomes an addiction when you know you don't need an SLR to make something cool every day.   Also for karma.   *..Kidding(?)*   14 was a worm's eye view of the inside of a dome of Masjid al-Nabawi in Medina. I had the opportunity to see it while I was in Saudi Arabia. It's one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to.   [2](http://i.imgur.com/h5in1HU.png), [5](http://i.imgur.com/BLQGnLQ.jpg), and [23](http://i.imgur.com/nLsniSk.jpg) are of downtown Dubai. The one of the building was right next to the Burj Khalifa.  [10](http://i.imgur.com/Yq8bsFS.jpg) and 12-18 were taken in Saudi Arabia. I was there last March. Some of the pictures in the album are of Masjid al-Nabawi and al-Haram, from the inside and outside. If you see the b w shot of the man walking under large umbrellas, those are put out there to keep people under the shade outside the mosque. It's amazing to see. The pictures don't do those places justice.  The shot of the [mountains](http://i.imgur.com/8eGiIvah.jpg) was taken in switzerland, somewhere in the alps. The rest were a collection of shots from Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas. Dallas is where I currently live. I'm really glad you guys like these. I'll make sure I post more soon!    Mostly the default camera. A few were shot with Camera+, and I touched them up using VSCO Cam and Afterlight.      Anytime! Here's my [website](http://mconpictures.com) if you want to check out some more work I do. :)   If there's one thing that Dallas has taught me, though, it's that you can find a good shot in anything you see around you. Even home. Keep a sharp eye out for what you find beauty out there and the pictures you take will follow your cue. And thank you, I really appreciate that, my friend!

This song has such a sick beat. I really do think *A Thousand Suns* gets too overlooked. It's their best album, in my opinion.   I thought it'd have been said by now, but **Recovery** by Eminem.   No moping, no self-loathing; just all out "I'm getting back where I should be" kinda feel when I listen to it. And 25 to Life was genius.   I made a mistake in the title: this is the oldest established university that's *still in continuous operation,* not the oldest university in the history of ever. Sorry!   I checked before posting it.

What phone?   AY-AHHHH   Jarvis: ONE *MORE* THING...   Guys, this is a repost of a picture I put up from my friend's facebook. This isn't the 101. It's in Jordan. The original is somewhere in my submissions.   I'm the original OP of the photo. It was indeed from my friend in Jordan.   Lost in the Echo... such a sick opening song.   Thanks for the feedback. It's definitely not perfect by a long shot, but it was really fun to work like this for the first time in a while! Hopefully I'll get to show you guys something awesome on here really soon; this time not in just a night's worth of work..  	57
 I won't have kids, and normal everyday people find that odd. Their kids are the light of their lives, the one thing that they care about above all else. But, think about that hard, loving something so strongly sets you up to be hurt in ways you could never recover. So, I won't be having children of my own, they could possibly end up like me. I suppose I should start at the beginning, please bear with me.  It was a hot sunny day and my backyard was its own fantasy world to me. I had my own sandbox next to the deck and using my plastic horses and a water bucket I was recreating a river for which the "herd" could play in. My father and mother stood off to the side a ways talking until they called me over to them. " Alli, you know that if your mother and I ever weren't together it wouldn't be your fault right?" I gave my father a goofy smile and I laughed at the absurdity of his statement. " Yeah, but you and mommy would never do that!" Innocence. My childhood ended that summer at 7 years old.  I knew they fought, it would have been hard to miss their shouting at night, but neither my sister or I commented and it all seemed normal, what did I have to go off of? Oddly enough my mother moved out with my sister, but left me with my father. All this was explained later, but my father simply told me that, " we each get one of you." It sounded fair.  I hated my fathers girlfriend. Typical, I know. What wasn't so typical was her telling me I couldn't play outside anymore. "It's not ladylike." she'd say. She got me dresses and made me do my hair. I was used to being a tomboy and getting dirty, she hated that. Her daughter and son were both into their late teens and I was my dads little brat. She would measure my waist and bust, made me wash my underwear by hand so no one would see it. She even had me pee into a cup, which I suspect now was she she could pass her drug tests.   She was supervising my cleaning the basement one day when she told me, " Don't think I don't know he loves you more than me." with a dark look to her eyes. It was then I knew for sure that she resented my father loving me.  I saw my mom every other weekend and they juggled holidays. There was no legal separation, the courts were never involved.   The Christmas Eve that I was 9 my world changed again.   People were at our house(my dads) it was a huge party with lots of adults and family ( his girlfriends not mine). My bedroom had to be gone through to get to the upstairs bathroom, poor design really. I went upstairs to my room, tired, wearing my baby blue little faux leather jacket and matching skirt. It was so pretty. I never wore it again.   I found him there. One of that womans family, a cousin or something. He was so drunk he couldn't talk right, but he had a guitar, and like any kid I loved guitars. He was sitting on my bed so I went over and sat down too and asked him what he was doing. He looked at me, little tiny me, and he grabbed my jacket and before I knew it he had his face slobbering all over me, his grossness in my mouth past my lips, I forced it out and clenched my teeth shut. He looked stricken. This fourty-something-year old man looked at me sadly and asked, " What? You don't like it?" I shook my head no, and I didn't know what else to do. I got up and walked to my door, my hand on the knob- it didn't budge. Shock. I rattled the door and looked around, then I heard it. Metal moving in the lock. I dropped down and saw two shadows, someone was standing there, their feet were there- and then they left.   My door was locked from the outside. There was no other way downstairs.  I repressed the initial memories for a long time. Him, then the other cousin that he let in on it. I never told a soul out of shame. I didn't think they'd believe I didn't want it to happen.   I was shocked one day at school when my mother came and just took me away. When I asked why, she gave me a newspaper article that had my fathers photo and some unrelated charges about drugs. He made the most wanted list, and I never saw him again. It came out that he had threatened to kill my mothers friends if she didn't let him keep me, that's why the one child to each parent. I knew my father wouldn't show up, but it still hurt that he was absent at my custody hearing since he had fled the country. I still wonder if he's alive and all that.  But, this was only really the beginning of why I'll never have children.  It took me years, (I'm 28 now) to even begin to understand myself. The PTSD, the Anxiety, the mild OCD, the insomnia, sleep paralysis, the alcoholic tenancies, nympho tendencies( which really make me feel sick and twisted, after my past let me tell you) Reoka ( a.k.a Dissociative Identity Disorder, my/her sociopathic tendancies...  I think it's important to share the rest to fully understand, but not today, I should have been asleep 5 hours ago already.  	1
 Fuck you jeb. Alienating voters since you opened your trap   Americans don't do anything wrong. Commie   Wow. How long have you been at it? I know it's a while, since you're the man around here.   Haha. I love the woman, but she seems to have a extremely conventional worldview.  Thanks for the response. I figured it was a gross exaggeration. But I wasn't sure. She kept telling me to look up the stats and that just as many men and women get raped and killed. Saying she see's shit on the news all the time. I thought that was bs.   In all your time, what's the worst that's happened to you?    Lmao.   Care to explain?   I'm really new to all of this and I do plan to travel. It won't happen for years to come, however, I will do it.   I hear from my Aunt and family about horrible hitchhiking experiences, people getting raped and murdered left and right. My dad used to hitchhike short distances locally until some guy fake threatened him, and then told him how unsafe it was. This was the 70's. So due to this, I've always had that stigma and fear about it.  Then I watched that *Thumbs up, America* where they show positive experiences. But even that guy said he was almost raped twice. It also seemed like some of it wasn't legit. And you fine folks seem to do it no problem. I'm wondering if some of you could share your perspectives and experiences. Thank you in advance.   I have to ask. Is this an accurate portrayal?    25k on a good day. 20k normally. All the way down to 5k at low hours.   Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwww   This is very true. But he's out for revenge at the moment.   I'm speaking purely economic regulations which have increased exponentially. Often not done by congress, but rather bureaucratic government organizations. This wasn't something that occurred when America was "booming" so to speak.   Completely untrue. The US was the world's leading economy by 1900, and it's been that way ever since. That war was simply dying 18th century empires on a last leg.  America led the world economically and politically without military intervention. The only thing that war wiped out was those countries militaries. Cept for Germany, poor bastards.   Define well regulated.   Over the course of the last 100 years. Regulations have continually been increasing up until today. It's not like those regulations from 1964 just went away and we started getting rid of them. There are exponentially *more* regulations now, then what were in place in... say 1945.  At any rate, Sanders talks of giving people free things. But I have yet to hear how he plans to fund them. This isn't the thinking that made our country great.   Certainly not socialism. It was free enterprise. The whole reason america became top dog economically so fast was because of our free market.    The policies he proposes aren't what made this nation great.    Too bad socialism won't work.    Good to see Reach getting some love   I also don't think he adopted the mentality of ONI, he is opposite ONI. It's possible the innies put an S-IV in Mk 6. But, he's had that mentality as a Spartan since he was trained. If anything, he's evolving past it.   But, we don't know, do we? It's a very real possibility he went off the wall.   That'd be awesome. It would have to be like an intro cinematic/mission where the player is thrust into this situation not knowing what the fuck is doing on. Then it cuts to Locke getting a briefing to catch the casual player up on whats happening   "Favored" oh they favored them all right   That was great. To add, maybe ONI isn't the bad guy in these situations or even halo 5. Think, they might have done some horrible things. But what are they doing now that they haven't been doing before? Generally, for what they believe, is the greater good. Now we have something intentionally stirring up chaos and the biggest scandal in human history.   It seems that someone or something may be trying to weaken humanity as a whole by causing dissent within the ranks of the UNSC, and stirring more people towards the innie cause then ever before. All while the Covenant is reforming under Jul for the sole purpose of destroying humanity. Now we have a flood return? So then the question remains, who is behind all of this?  Absolute. Fucking. ***CHAOS***   You haven't played halo for what we can assume was like 8 years?   I shouldn't have said anything. Ignore my comment.  O_O   Nothing to see here. Move along   This is absolutely amazing. It's super dark. As a listener, you don't know what to believe. Do you believe chief had a reason? Or that he went off the chain and derailed legitimate peace talks? Is chief a hero or a legitimate traitor? Even as listeners now, we have no idea. Before, we were sure chief had his reasons.   It looks at the spartan program and ONI from a different light. We see how people view the chief and the political climate of humanity. Locke finally has justification for his mission. Humanity will be thrust into chaos, and will be pushed to the brink of destruction once more.   This is the theory I like. I refuse to believe my boy would do this. Either ONI is framing him (which wouldn't make sense, they've fucked him over), he went off the wall for real (a very real possibility for all he's been through), or your suggestion and his motive was pure.  They really do a good job of keeping this hard to predict and they keep you on your toes. Nobody knows what's going to happen.    Lose weight and good be a bombshell   Are you a witch?    Lose weight. Dress better. That's it.    Second pic looks best from the front   Holy shit. You fucking came here to be judged solely on your looks.    Why into Paul McGann though. Don't get me wrong, I really want that man to have a well deserved series on TV.   Amazing. What a man of strong integrity.   Often deluded. However, he gets the job done and saves the day in the end. Regardless of how sadistic and manipulative it may be.   Bro. Nice. Keep us updated.   In other news: 10's ego goes through the roof.   He was offered the part at one point. Actually, of the eleventh doctor   At times, I think it's his personal goal.   It puts what Missy says to the doctor in perspective.   Holy shit. You're right   Glad you got that fixed. That flat top made you look like biff from Back to the future   I enjoyed this. Good content   He's easily my favorite doctor. He'll be nuwho's tom baker.   Loved it   Your style is something an early 2000s douche would wear. It's shit.    More pics.   I use reddit is fun.    You didn't cite Financial Times. You can't cite something that you casually mention. You need a link. At the moment, it's anecdotal.  Labor doesn't need to up for capital to be gained. The whole point of capitalism is to make money, and with the internet, its easier to make money with LESS input (labor required to produce) and MORE output. So that whole point about financial times fails, it just means the free market found more effective ways to produce something. If anything, the internet is the greatest true capitalistic tool of our age.   - It allows for equal opportunity to earn money.  - people can freely get their ideas out there. - people aren't suppressed. Even though the government is trying.  - There are no or limited regulations holding businesses and enterprise on the internet.  - anyone can learn if they have the drive to do so.  These are capitalist properties, not socialist. Reddit is a capitalist product, Facebook is a capitalist product, and so is almost everything else on the internet. If you think the internet is "socialist" you're blind and need to understand economics.   I suggest reading *Economics in one lesson* by Harry Hazlett, *the law* by Fredric Bastiat, *Economic Facts and Fallacies* by Thomas Sowell, and *Capitalism and freedom* by Milton Freedman. These are written by legitimate and reputable economists. Make an effort to understand all economic systems and how ours is *supposed* to work. www.FEE.com is a great site for learning economics   Is the crossover on netflix?   No. Its not.   And if you're being serious, you seriously misunderstand capitalism.   You have to be absolutely blind to think that the internet has not benefited capitalism. Seriously.    I'd keep bulking. Get the mass, then cut out and you'll look great.   So stupid. It's been tried and done in Europe, and failed. Socialism fails.   Getting back to our roots!   Bro chill. Plays better without radar and has been that way for awhile.    CE is my favorite too. Been playing it non stop since launch. Never played the original much though. Why's radar need to be disabled?  Edit. It was explained   Ready to do it again? Except firefight   Starry night   I think there will be an explanation scene in the context that they are explaining it all to Agent Locke. We will get flashbacks as well as maybe playing a bit. Just so the casual player has more than enough context to enjoy the game   And predictions. Predicting your opponents next move is crucial. Helps you place that shot, or land they nade.   Brows on point Ass on point Face on point.   Well, porn did spearhead the streaming industry.    He won't win lmao.    Because it'll probably suck. Sorry :/   Oh my god. That's horrible.   Halo 1 is probably my favorite base multiplayer game. So addicting and fun   OP pls   Shoulda kept the hair   That was a really good post. I follow HCS and watch streams casually but I didn't know half of that    I hop on there occasionally. It got an update and I enjoy the content they put up. Just featured a Reach montage last week and they put all updates on it.   Did you tell her? She'd feel so awkward   I saw it walk away at the end   Hahaha. I get it. Because of the name of the old H3 mod   That is irrelevant. They are different games with maps designed to suit the game. Lockout wouldn't play well with H5 for a variety of reasons. However, Truth plays well and integrates skill jumping techniques that are arguably more challenging than traditional crouch jumping. Just because something changes, doesn't mean it's worse or bad.   Crouch jumping still plays an integral part in the meta.   I look forward to many more H5 tage's from you good sir.   Have you seen the tutorial videos? Skill jumps exist. And are fucking difficult to pull off, especially in a fast paced environment. Crouch jumping still adds extra height to get the jump.    He wants to make himself feel good. That's why he responded, and with such ferocity.   He really has a stick up his ass. Trying to tear people down to make himself feel better. What a dick   So what happened to Ed?   That was awesome. gg bravo. Very in depth analysis of everything and great graphics   Anarcy for life   Yes pls. Wait, the RE integration? So they were once integrated?   o7    Eh. I don't think she looks trashy.    I think Kim is hot as shit. She just needs to tone down the make up.   Idk whose down voting you. You are literally halo Jesus   Too bad they are busy circle jerking to a Burnie Sanders pic.   Or at a convention, he described where the RvB story takes place in Halo canon as the moment of rage when you throw your controller against a wall and it breaks. In that moment, exists RvB   Too bad it is.    Thanks for the gold!   Cute hippie.   Damn girl. What nationality are you? You look like Kim Kardashian.    /r/trashy   That was ultra cringe   I'll vote for Rand Paul. Much better than the "puppet republicans".    Nah. He shouldn't.   Fuck yes. Get it.   I want to go with Johnson. If he came back I'd flip. But realistically I'd have to go with Buck.    More channels leads to more content. But there needs to be an audience.    Sick bro   I've suggested this before, but in my opinion Spartan Ops were an amazing innovation yet poorly implemented. So as a result, I would like to see Spartan Ops return with seasonal storylines from around the universe. For example, a storyline from Johnson's time as an S1, playing as an ancient human during the war period, Kurt during his time with Green, headhunter missions, or even Noble Six's survival and redeployment (he's alive *fuckers*).   There is SO much they could do with SO many stories to tell from this rich universe. As for gameplay, they should play more like a campaign rather than firefight with more interesting levels. They could do it and it player retention would go through the roof. But they would need a dedicated team similar to the way they do campaigns. Just release the missions weekly like a TV show.   Withdrawals are happening.    Yeah. I don't speak Polish   It looks line you're going through the middle school scene phase. There is a way to pull off piercings and whatnot. This isn't it.    Bernie Sanders. Holy shit it just never stops.   More pics   I subbed  	107
          Pssst, patent this.      Sure. Anything in particular you want to see?  For a second I considered asking what about a neutrally-labeled picture of an overworked underage girl in wartime screams "Soviet propaganda" at you, but nevermind, I might be better not looking into that void.                           Hi! I'd like to introduce our new, free app [Mother To Be] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mother-to-be-app/id962704086?mt=8). The title makes it clear enough that's a rather niche application intended for those going though pregnancy. Basically, it's an interactive calender that allows to keep track of various parameters (weight, diet habits, sleep patterns) and make notes - a personal journal of sorts. We're very fond of the concept and would appreciate feedback, especially from the target audience. Please tell what you think is lacking and which features you found redundant.      Got it all over himself, yeah. None ingested thankfully.                                      	29
 I appreciate and generally agree with your position BossOfTheGame, but *you're* the one taking "be a man" out of context here. Ardenfrost was using it in while specifically addressing the gendered father-daughter relationship, so his use of the gendered "Man" is appropriate. He isn't ignoring cultural influence on gender perception, he's responding to it--I can't help but wonder if you even read the comment.  Beyond gender, "Man" implies adulthood, which is essentially at the root of Ardenfrost's statement. There could be and have been countless similar meditations on how motherhood informs womanhood; that's actually a topic that informs large segments of feminist theory.  On a personal note, BossOfTheGame, your baseless insinuation that nmoyer12 and Ardentfrost are willfully ignoring some hidden socio-structural truth that only brooding philosophers like you are privy to makes you sound like a pompous ass. I don't know you, you're probably nice, but that's just how it reads.   Ah, cool. Chalk it up to semiotic providence then.   I've noticed that companies like Google and Microsoft have been spending  pretty big advertising money on pushing their respective browsers. What's in it financially for them? They don't have any ads that I can see, so do they make money on extension licencing or something? Are browsing histories being monitored or monetized? Is it just a ploy to get people to accidentally use Bing?   it is the kind of dumb shit that a worked up school board could flip out over, though.   And a pen! Don't forget the pen!   It does occupy a very interesting space. Even the title has a touch of race consciousness to it: taken on its own, white castle sounds a bit like caucasion paradise or Anglo estates or something; appropriate, as the two minority characters navigate white-dominated American culture. Call it a coincidence, but given the facts that the rest of the film *is* visibly race-conscious and that they could have easily chosen any other restaurant, I do think there is a deliberate political statement in there.   I'm sorry that you feel that way, takeheed. If it helps, my point was not that anyone was downvoting because they disagree with you, but that we likely already accept the expressed opinion as established fact to the extent that it doesn't really add much to the conversation to reiterate it.   **Observe and Report**: while many wrote it off as a Paul Blart Mall Cop copycat, the movie is a pitch black satire that owes more to Taxi Driver than Happy Madison. A lot of movies glorify delusional underdog ambition, conflict resolution through violence, and shallow sex objects as love interests. Observe and Report renders those typically unchallenged values entirely pathetic, absurd, disturbing, and hilarious. You may need a fairly dark sense of humor to appreciate it, however: I was literally the only person laughing in my theater.   Not to be a dick, but I doubt that you're going to blow any minds in TrueFilm by saying that Hollywood is generally shallow.   Well, that's completely made up, but whatever floats your boat.   MDC is a perfect example of the complete *opposite*: they employ strong language to assault those in power, *not* to pile on the oppressed.  My problem is not and has never been this fey "ooh a bad word" shit I seem to be accused of; the fact is that these words, in this order, in this context express and promote, at best, ignorance, and at worst, bigotry.   Yeah, I'm aware of the AIDS crisis, thanks. Leaving my panties out of the equation, an artist has a uniquely privileged voice. They can use that voice to stick it to anyone they want. In this song, Axl Rose used his voice to stick it to the mistrusted and downtrodden, the disenfranchised, the *literally dying and beaten minorities* around him. I never knew about it, I shared it, I think it's interesting in its own unfortunate way--I come down on the side of "Fuck him then," but other than that, it ain't that deep.   Axl Rose has every right to express his frustration in any form he chooses, but if his most artful songwriting strategy is to rail against "niggers, immigrants, and faggots," then that's ridiculous and pointlessly hateful and fuck him, personally.  In [responding to the song's controversy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_in_a_Million_\(Guns_N%27_Roses_song\)#Controversy), Rose stated that his "pro-heterosexual" stance (his term) was based on "bad experiences" with gay men--in that light, his claim that "faggots [...] spread some filthy disease" appears to be based on hateful generalization, which is literally exactly what bigotry is. He has since gone on the record listing a handful of gay or bisexual individuals who he admires, and good for him if his position has evolved, but that neither explains nor excuses the song.  On his use of the word "nigger," Rose has paradoxically claimed that nigger doesn't mean black (bullshit) and later that he was only referring specific black people who were trying to rob him (more bullshit). I charitably suspect that he's a bit of an idiot   Explain.   By that standard, literally every idiotic thing ever expressed is art simply by virtue of its genesis in real life. That doesn't make this song commendable, effective, or good in any sense.  Personally, I'd prefer that nigger and faggot *weren't* casually tossed around all the time, but that doesn't mean I support censoring the words from artistic usage. I simply think that as used in this song, they express and encourage self-righteous ignorance. Art or not, I'm hardly a simpleton for calling that bigotry.   Immigrants and faggots   They make no sense to me   They come to our country   And think they'll do as they please   Like start some mini Iran,   Or spread some fuckin' disease  [...]  You're one in a million  Yeah that's what you are  You're one in a million, babe   You're a shooting star!   No, Axl Rose doesn't know what art is. This is not Ulysses, this is not Piss Christ, it's not even Woman is the Nigger of the World.  It's just a shitty song laced with some truly unfortunate ignorance.   Sure, but art has meaning. These words are being used with no artistic purpose beyond anger.   The words are "niggers" and "faggots." Up to speed?   Racism at [1:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DavdKjepuQg#t=1m5s), xenophobia and homophobia at [2:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DavdKjepuQg#t=2m14s).  Definitely sullies Sweet Child of Mine a bit for me.   Huh, I guess that's [another TIL.](http://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/articles/showarticle.php?articleid=56) To be fair, people today have a much better understanding of homosexuality than I'm sure Axl Rose did at the time, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a fairly nasty and indignant song that deliberately marginalizes minority "Others" in broad strokes.      I'm considering using a selection from Rhapsody in Blue for a film I'm working on, abut I'm having a hard time figuring out who owns the rights and how far they extend. Composed in 1924, it's a public domain piece almost everywhere in the world except the United States. It has some kind of copyright extension here, but I'm not sure if that applies to specific orchestrations or all variations generally.  Ideally, I'd like to arrange and record my own version of the piece. Does anyone have any experience or resources on the issue?   Not exactly, but they may be able to fake it. The "film feel" isn't so much about literal frame rate as shutter speed and motion blur--simply halving the number of frames won't fix that. It's certainly possible that they can digitally *synthesize* the film feel, but that would be an added special effect rather than a recovery per se.   Credit where it's due: "Walking Away" is certainly a classier title than "I took a picture of a hot chick's ass!"   what? no it isn't. it's literally the weakest evidence possible.   The weirdest part was the people calling him pathetic for caring too much about karma. If unearned karma moves you to rage, you're the one who's weirdly invested.   cool! I'm considering an eventual torrent release for an indie that I'm working on, too. What sort of distribution have you had up to this point? Any festivals or streaming?   So... why is this okay?   Is it just me, or is this a really smooth version of the verse from "Born This Way?"   What the hell does that have to do with indogofriday's grandpa's funeral?   using logic *is* the same is fundamentally rationalist. that's [exactly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism#Background) what it is.   yes I am. Wikipedia on epistemological rationalism: "any view appealing to reason as a source of knowledge or justification". I said rational, I meant rationalist, apologies if that was confusing.  Science draws on rationalist components like mathematics, adds empirical experimentation, and spits out rationalist generalization. Empiricism is part of it, but rationalism is too.   Correct. The scientific process draws on empiricism *and* rationalism.   Science certainly draws on Mathematics though, and the process of generalization is an equally Rational pursuit. To claim that science eschews rationalism is patently absurd.   Agreed. And that's one of many reasons why it's stupid to dismissively characterize scientists as exclusively empiricist.   yeah, lobaroja85, about that...   went down as soon as I finished watching it. I feel kind of special now.         Also, that it's fascinatingly terrible in every way.      Ha! Caught her being a lovely person!   Because the guy who's super dedicated to getting longest road almost never wins--better to let him just fizzle out on his own.   I'm quite partial to his work on [the Lion King](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxlSv97uljM feature=related), personally.   What are you doing? Genuinely curious.   The joke would be that *they* thought the interview went very well, while Hannibal Buress is actively ripping on them in his latest special.   I was hoping you'd link to the [Daily Eastern News](http://thelaughbutton.com/news/college-newspaper-responds-joke-hannibal-buress-special/#.T8VUzNVYv8k) article.   It's a bit porny for my taste, but it's a nice community regardless.   Electricity!   Tubthumping on loop just sounds awesome.   It seems like it might be less of a hassle to just find a decent Gerard Butler imitator and use a sound-alike. The recording is copyrighted, but the word and inflection are not.   Yeah, I'm familiar with what the term is supposed to mean. I just mean that the community is pretty hostile to *allegations* of white knighting, and generally rightly so. Where some people (sometimes fairly) see immaturity in the perceived lady honor defending, it generally seems like the white knight accusers are part of a far more troubling and idiotic wave of nerdy misogyny. "What? You want me to stop making fun of this chubby fourteen-year-old posing at comic con? Pfft whatever White Knight, I didn't know she was your girlfriend." No. Fuck that. If someone is being patronizing in their defense of somebody's honor or whatnot, then call them on it. "White Knight" brings nothing to the conversation.  I take umbrage with the suggestion that the term "white knighting" is somehow integral to Reddit overall. Reddit isn't full of "white knights," nor is it full of people who oppose "white nights;" it is, in my tiny little experience, full of people who think the phrase is idiotic and downvote accordingly.  None of which is to say anything about you personally, Gareth--I generally agree with most of the points you make. I have not, however, ever seen the simplistic reduction "white knight" used in a productive, insightful, or even particularly accurate way on this site.   Is white knight actually a Reddit thing? I've only ever seen the term invoked by idiots who are quickly downvoted.   The emoticon sells it.      It's a song about self-love and acceptance written at a time when racial turmoil was at the forefront of American culture. I wouldn't say it's specifically, exclusively about being black, but it certainly can be.   The correct response was, "I'll come back to this one."   Though your effort is appreciated, I know all that. I just hate playing in 4:3 letterbox, and would rather see games optimized for the ubiquitous 16:9 format ala the Super Mario Advance re-releases. Purely personal preference.   This is the number one reason why Virtual Console games do not receive my business. Also because I am broke. Tied for number one, I guess.   Duly humbled. :P  I wasn't really trying to initiate any dick-swinging, though--I know it's miles below what most people around here are used to, but it's a significant leap for me. Just wanted to share the feeling. :)   I would think that any mandatory life sentence for a non-heinous crime is neither reasonable nor ethical, but that's just my two cents.   One thing to consider is that the cocks will probably come out clean, whereas the fetuses could potentially be a bit soupy. If the cocks are too large or too dry, however, that might cause bleeding, so maybe soupy is better.   Wouldn't the fetuses be pretty draining, though? I mean, I'm a pretty staunchly pro-choice individual with a fairly unromantic view of fetal development, but I feel like wiping unborn fluids out of my ass-crack would really get to me after awhile.  Then again, massive cocks.      "I love you" over and over again. If all I have is five minutes of communication with [him](http://imgur.com/U7ngo), then what else matters?   1) Yes, you're right.  2) Fuck off.   Hmm. Basic tolerance of chubby comic fans having fun doesn't seem like that radical of a position to me, but whatever.   So yes, we can indeed confirm that it is a sign from the devil.   I don't dislike Nolan, though. I'm not a big fan of TDK or Inception, but I really dig The Prestige and Batman Begins for some reason.  You dislike his popular things and prefer his less widely appreciated things? Mysterious.   Interesting perspective; the need for an efficient cause seems like a modern take on the [Cosmological Argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_argument). Just to clarify, why is it assumed in this theory that God *does* preserve the cosmos? It's always been my understanding that the universe is [expected to collapse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe) at some point.   Great to hear, I'm glad your faith brings you so much positive fulfillment! I'm intrigued by your description of God as "conscious"--acknowledging your proviso that it's based in personal experience, can you explain a little bit about what you mean by that?   I figured he was just making a pun on the term devil's advocate. I've never met a genuine theistic Satanist, personally.   Great, thoughtful response. It seems reasonable that any "God" would be something beyond human understanding.  My question, if I may: what happens to God when our understanding improves? If there is a definite God beyond the threshold of our comprehension, then it seems like perfect hypothetical understanding of the universe would prove its existence. And yet, for many people, knowing and comprehending a "formula" for all existence like you suggest would be the ultimate triumph of atheism, as there would be no higher power than that.  So: is it *conceivable* that God could exist once we have full knowledge of the universe, and if so, what would that God look like? If not, can God be said to exist at all?   Ah.   Fair enough, seems like a solid thing to believe in. Why do you personally choose the label "theist" for that though, if I may inquire?   No name-dropping, no book recommendations, just your own naked rationalization of faith.   That first conversation with Sovereign was one of my favorite game moments ever. The villain of Mass Effect 1 is Nietzsche's fucking void, it is a batshit version of the 2001 monolith, it is Solaris on crack. I don't care if Shepard lives or dies or if every question is answered or even whether any of my choices mattered in the end, but I would have liked to go down fighting something *that* thematically hardcore.   Do it!      It's been a couple years since I took PSY 101, but my memory of it is this: we spent a day or two on the history of psychology--ancient philosophical perspectives, Freud's popularization, the welcome switch to scientific methodology with behaviorism, the current cognitive revolution--and then spent the remainder of the semester learning about what we know and how we know it, because that's what you do in a science class. Freud had no evidence to support his claims, and thus had nothing to offer us beyond a single powerpoint slide on history day. Science classes are under no obligation to present every truth claim as equally valid; that would be terrible terrible terrible terrible science.  As for the word science, you're willfully using an antiquated definition. For those of us speaking in post-Aristotelian terms, the scientific method is, via [Oxford](http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/scientific%2Bmethod?q=scientific+method), "a method of procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses." This does not apply to all pursuits of knowledge, but to the very specific pursuits of scientists. Freud lacked systematic experiments and testable hypotheses, therefore his work is not science.  With respect to post-modernism: you have never met a working scientist who feels legitimately threatened by it, and you never will. Post-modernism will keep on bloobly dooping through subjective truths and stoner woo bullshit until it fizzles out within the next academic trend cycle, and science will keep on exploring the cosmos, developing medicine, advancing technology, and studying real, fundamental truths about the universe and our place in it. Call me dogmatic--seriously! do it now!--but I'll make damn sure that my art, philosophy and ethics can coexist rationally with testable, rational scientific thought... you know, real life.   Well, first thing's first, you've accused me of distorting the past three times now, and it's simply never happened. I said Freud was influential. I have no history of or interest in obscuring that fact. But whatever his influence, he has no place in the science classroom.  As for your other claims, you seem to be mixing epistemology and science interchangeably. Epistemology is the study of truth, Science is a very specific pursuit of truth through testable hypotheses and rational extrapolation. Freud pursued truth through theory, scientists pursue truth through science, and I'm not weaseling any linguistic marginalization into the discussion by saying so--that's just how language works. I don't use the word science because it implies superior authority or anything, I use it when discussing the *specific* thing that science is. Freud, for better or worse, has no right to claim scientific authority if he doesn't participate in the stuff of what science is, and he didn't and he doesn't.  As for the whole Empiricism vs. Rationalism debate, that whole contrived conflict strikes me as perhaps the greatest hypocrisy in post-modern thought: while the post-modern kids claim to be breaking down unjust binaries and redressing linguistic marginalizations, they do so by turning *every damn conflict* into the same damn simplistic binary they think they're railing against--hell, the name "post-modernism" is a fucking antithetical. The fact is that whatever the Philosophy and English professors might think, there are not roving gangs of rationalists and empiricists attacking each other in the streets.  On the contrary, rationalism and empiricism work quite harmoniously together in, drumroll please, the scientific method! Science loves rationalism *and* empiricism! They're two great tastes that that go great together, and when you combine them in science, they have a 1:1 correlation with reality outside the classroom. That's far more than any abstract unprovable theory can claim.   If you think making shit up doesnt play a huge roll in science **today** then you should stay the fuck away from science, because you obviously cannot understand the role insight and intuition play in generating hypotheses   . Must be testable? Sorry, but you are trying to place your modern conception of science into the **past**, and that just reeks of bad historigraphy.  .  You seem to be the one mixing eras here, singdawg. All I said was that "science today," your term, needs to be testable; Freud's "making shit up" approach doesn't have quite the clear-cut legacy in modern thought that you were implying. If you're saying that Freud is/was a scientist by virtue of his era's lowered standards, then fine--I don't see how that matters outside of a history class, but whatever.  And if you want to put Freud in a history of thought class, then go for it. But if you want to put him in a science class, then you're promoting regressive, outdated pseudo-science. I don't really see a debate to be had there.   Freud was a highly influential theorist, but a scientific hypothesis must be testable, the end.    Wake up, Matthew.   Shit, an Elcor named Filbert sounds awesome. Not even joking, I'd take him with me on every mission.   One of the most masterful scenes in Jackass 3D. Love the [shot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDz4Bs9UaAw) when the the dildo comes into the crazy narrow focus super slowly, and when you realize its a dildo it's away like a foot away from your face thanks to the stereoscopy. Fuck *Hugo*, that movie was hands down the biggest leap forward in cinema to come out of this 3D thing.   This is the epilogue I was waiting for.   Honestly, this is exactly what was *right* about the endings for me. Mass Effect has never been about making you a messiah; at its core it's been about [making tough sacrifices from day one.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcM4VPdke8o) The original game was defined by no-win choices like Kaiden or Ashley, human lives or the council... Mass Effect presents a world where victory only comes with a tinge of guilt and regret, and it's all the more resonant for that.  The fact that the Normandy wigs out and no repercussions are shown, however... I got nothing. DLC time!      ha! *gay*!   "I was going to write something. I forgot what it was. It felt important."  My twelve-year-old sister was talking about a facebook status when she said this, but it completely captured the creative funk I was in at the time.   I'd just like to chime in that on a purely aesthetic level, the monoliths occupy a two dimensional viewing space more often than not. Beyond their physical presence in the film, they take on the role of complete, inscrutable obstruction for the viewer, much like the mind might respond to knowledge that advanced.   Unless it's a documentary, every film has its own diegesis. Boondock Saints exists in a world where God Almighty demands street justice, untrained vigilantes are effective killers through mimicking bad television, and straight men are attracted to Willem Defoe in drag. This is not real life.  The fact that this movie and others exist in a clearly fictional world is what makes the vigilante action justice harmless and acceptable--most action movies do a far better job of justifying their killing, but whatever. The *only* reason that the paltry, unsupported criticism is included is for the purpose of taking the film's action diversion into the real world, and that's where it goes from fluff to message movie.   And if you made a movie with all sympathetic characters bashing gays, then portrayed it as a fifty fifty split public issue, it'd be just as backwards as this shit fucking movie. When you take a *fucking crazy backward position* and stage it on equal footing with its sane, rational antithesis, your lending backward bullshit legitimacy that it doesn't deserve. The real-life popularity of any issue is not and has never been my point. It's like when people say Obama is a Muslim: that is an *insane* position, and anyone who frames the issue as a one to one ratio controversy is elevating the batshittery undeservedly, whether consciously or not   Sure. The penguins are one-dimension characters written for the sole purpose of being punished, and the brothers *know* this because *God* tells them, so they are thus free to rape them all without due process. It's fine for a dumb movie, it's psychotic in real life, it's as crazy as ever to contextualize such actions as a legitimate arguable public position. What's your point?   I really liked the gay angle until they *did* make it part of the plot, sticking him in a dress and making him punchline. Unfortunate.   that has nothing to do with it. If somebody makes a movie about a bunch of heroic characters raping penguins, then ends in pseudo-documentary footage of a 50/50 split on the issue of penguin rape, then it's totally fair to attribute some sort of penguin raping agenda there. I don't know how many people are actually pro-murder *or* pro-penguin rape, but the fact that it's portrayed as an issue of public debate is clearly an attempt to lend the discussion some legitimacy.   The fact that the movie even thought there was a debate to be had was insane. In real life, killing strangers because God told you to is fucking nuts, the end. If everyone agrees with them--as every sympathetic character in the film to that point had--then it's a goofy fiction. When it's portrayed out of nowhere as some sort of controversial issue, it's clear that the film misguidedly thinks there's an argument to be had for killin' all the bad guys.   thanks, he's a goldendoodle!      $400 is actually pretty generous for a twelve-year-old's allowance.  	101

To put in perspective, a single celled organism can be as small as .1 microns per Google, and a human is 6 feet.   Using this scale, a .1 micron organism to a 6 foot human is the equivalent of a 6 foot human to something 20,000 miles long.  I realize a solar system is way longer than that, but I wonder if we could eventually multiply to that size or beyond given infinite time.

 Shit, someone stole my profile pic   gotta get there before the hair   He's really laid-back and charismatic. But primarily, he's just damn funny and has been since he was Knighted as Not So Grump   Yes. Yes he is   People don't have to be bound by something they said in the past. He could change his mind at any time. But yes, it would be great to see him on Grumpcade.  Maybe he and Dan will debut on Grumpcade with the same episode   Ne'er a truer word spoken!   Do you have Soundbooth? If you do, use the preset "Reduce Peaks" apply it, then use the preset "Everything The Same Level" and apply that.  The Grumps use something along those lines with their own preset in their audio program.    Coming this summer: "Anne Frank" starring Miley Cyrus!   thats the one!   lol, I believe there's a song on youtube about that   r/askreddit is the most curious little boy I've ever met!   There's r/funny being obnoxious again... god, someone needs to change his name...   my worst nightmare....   Four Score and Seven Beers Ago, I realized I am lonely... I need someone to accompany me to the theater tonight.   (Executive) You can't use that scene idea for a SpecSaver ad! Put that idea in the rejected pile!   you already had me shaking it at "ice cold"   Cool harp! Do you know how to play "Iron Man?"   I like Arin the most. He's the funniest and he's clearly a caring and generous guy, considering he built this business using his popularity to give his friends employment, and to help them get their own popularity (I highly doubt Jontron or NSP would be doing well without their involvement with Egoraptor)  I think his comedy is better suited for what he's doing now, a twice a day, ten-minute show where he just improvises, making jokes about video-games, instead of his animations: an occasional 30-second to 1-minute short where he improvises, making jokes about video-games. I don't see all the hype about missing his animations. He's making the exact same jokes on Grumps he'd be making with his animations, he just doesn't have to take months to *animate* the jokes. And let's be honest, he's not exactly a good artist. Decent enough to make animations, but not good.  *Having that said*, I can't stand his opinions on most issues, and I think he has very bad analytical skills regarding video-games and movies. I also can't stand his whining (but I hate whining from anyone, even Dan and Jon.... but Arin does it the most)  And I think he handled the Jon fiasco the right way. If there was a bad-guy in the breakup, I'd think Jon was probably it.   But that perception is delusional. It was an official business when Jon was there.  It's impossible to be successful on Youtube unless you run it like a business. It is a job, after all, and Game Grumps was a business from day one   with a Kitchen Knife   Oh shit, have I been weeding out friends on facebook the wrong way?   Never knew there was a thing called Maker TV   I thought Disneyland moved to New York   Are Arin and DisneyLand still friends?   That was pretty damn clever! :D   But dude, there weren't even any jelly beans in that level   Thank you all for throwing this WONDERFUL baby shower!  The baby's dead, ANYWAY, who wants cake?   Dude, don't go that way. There's a big mine fiel-- (**BOOM**)   This summer! Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg star in... "The Host And The Parasite!"  Rated PG-13   You have money right? Yeah, you can afford liposuction   But they made chemotherapy sound so fun!   I feel like this scene prompt gets posted in some iteration almost on a weekly basis   Welcome back to the second season of Firefly! Which takes place in space, but the space part DOESN'T matter!   How many times have I told you... you put the cereal in **BEFORE** THE MILK!!!   I think you would feel that same emotional attachment to another form of entertainment that brings you joy, if you stopped watching Game Grumps.   I don't know why everyone thinks he's so bad at games. I mean, he did grab *ALL 30 JELLY BEANS* every single time!   I usually don't care, but there's only so many jokes Danny can make at the expense of Arin's failure before it gets boring. A whole episode of fuck-ups is fine, but not if it's the exact same fuck-up over and over again. Go to a different level and fuck-up there.  Plus, it's just super fucking annoying to hear Arin complain about a video-game. Ever.   Yeah, that works. Looked up a quick video   Ah. Makes sense   really? I have to try this real quick (*fuck* looking it up)   edit: It doesn't work   Eh, whatever happens   Umm... are you stupid or a troll?

Besides the obvious sexual reasons, she also has a job that would bring home a good amount of money, and she'd be able to protect the house pretty damn well. I'd basically let her wear the pants of the relationship, which I'd be okay with because of those sweet, pointy ta-tas   Mostly being scared   I dunno... GOD, I hate questions like this! It just ruins my day! Jesus! Grrr!   Damn, Candice, I can see where you got that sweet ass..... your dad in those jeans is drivin' me wild!

That's your great great great(x1000) grandmother!   lol, I think that was on Family Guy   Well, shucks! I've now been halfway turned into the last animal I touched! This is quite a predicament!   Story, Mario's hair color, A box that is without a beat, Ross's face, Food, Good Games   lol, I think each and every sin should end with "unless you want to"   You should put a parenthetical next to Ross like this:  Ross (Sometimes?)   They mostly play older Nintendo games that are basically an abandoned market. The primary reason is, Nintendo hasn't found the Grump videos or cared enough to flag them.  Plus, Maker Studios has a better understanding of the ins-and-outs of the legal issues presented here. I think they'd be confident enough to defend the Grumps in court if Nintendo tried to claim the revenue.   Send something to their twitters   I am Ganondorf! King of all Evil in the Land of Hyrule!

If it aint in my hands by then, I'm gonna hook you up with a nice job with medical benefits that pays 35 dollars an hour so you can pay off your debt!  ....trust me... you don't want it to go that far..   I brought you a little something that'll warm your house.... it's a *fire!*   Robin! Quick! To the Batmobile! Mr. Slippy Fist is getting away!   I've noticed it. I kinda have that same behavior when my best friends talk about hanging out with other people   It was probably planned for it to be once Danny had a series longer than Sonic 06.  They probably only picked FireRed back up so that they wouldn't have to wait as long to reach that point.   Nice to see a fan that understands that the channel is more than just a show where people talk around video-games. It's a legitimate business that produces a product in an industry where you walk a fine line between being profitable and being bankrupt, entirely depending on how your audience perceives you.  You also have a fantastic grasp on the New Media industry.  Most people (especially on this sub) don't understand the decisions that Arin made about mentioning Jon and they think that: Jon disagreeing with Arin's decisions = Arin lied.  I think they handled the situation perfectly, and I think they let the right amount of time pass to cement the new era of Game Grumps in, so that they could discuss the old era without the potential to damage the show.   Happy Birthday..... Mr. President...... (seductive dancing)   Damn it! Nothing but white kids again...   Who wants Jack Daniels?    I liked Jon's part, lol. Like he was in exile.   We need Nostalgia Critic and Egoraptor playing a Simpsons game   Eh, Bloodborne's been pretty boring so far... but I wouldn't say it matters if it's Modern or not. They should just play what they feel like playing.   I kinda prefer them fucking up a lot though. It reminds me that I'm not watching this show for the games   everybody do.... **The Barry Bump!**  (beatboxing begins)   If they turned off the music settings, sure.  It's an amazing game, too, I'd love to see them play it as it'd spark a lot of heavy metal music discussions.   Some of the things Arin has said about motivation, hard work, and etc.   Yes   I saved this country 2 billion dollars in debt by switching to Geico!   And the rockets red glaaare!    yeah, there's a demo somewhere.  it wasn't good   It's an actual project, not just a Let's Play. It takes time to produce, and they don't have a big post-production team. There's a lot of editing that needs to be done, which will be more complicated because they'll have to make sure it's coherent and actually tells a story (even if it is a Reality-Show-esque story) There seems to be a lot of live-action elements to it, and that's a lot harder to edit than game footage. There's a lot more to editing a real project than just putting clips in the correct order. Once the raw edit is done, it is immediately followed by Sound Mixing, Music, Color Correction, etc.  Each of which are difficult and time-consuming on their own.  They also have to balance this project with the other projects they're working on (some of which they probably haven't told the fans about yet)   Hey, Cyclops.... *Staring Contest?*   SERIOUSLY, JESUS!? Heroin!? In MY house!?  I knew being a hippie for 30 years would lead to this!   "Well, Mr. Johnson, you're hired! I think you're the best person for this position!"

 Its not, trust me.   When I was in 7th grade who had a funny last name, we called him sperm lock insted. He over heard me and a freind laughing about it one day, he called is into his room and told us that if he ever heard is call him that agin he would "tear of our heads and shit down our wind pipes." My freind told him mom and the teacher had to write a apology.       If you would rather listen than read I would recommend Dan Carlins podcast hardcore history. It's amazing! His "fall of the republic" I a six part series on the fall of the roman republic. He also did an epic serial on the Mongols. Top notch stuff.   The after shot reminds me of the refugee camp in children of men.   on your app select follow when on the playlist, it should be at the top of the list    Sorry if I used metal as a generic term, HARD ROCK, is that better.         got him    I'm stealing this idea for burning man.   Right now I'm a little below matinence at about 3000 cal a day, I work two full time jobs both in the food industry so eating often and healthy isn't a problem, I'm at about 260 g of potien 300g carbs and 90g of fat.

 Those still are a massive buff though. With 40%CDR, you get to riptide every 2.4 seconds! You'll do a lot more damage over time with that then you will with a 25 damage DOT, that only stays up with your shield being up.   It gives her more burst, but hugely effects her early clears in the jungle   The %health being removed is a huge nerf to her early clears.   Noc top.   Nocturne isn't terrible at pre6 ganks if you hit your Q. Odds are you won't get a kill unless you have a lockdown laner, but you can force flashes incredibly easy.   Then again, c9 is famous for the "I got cumshot in 7" being played over comms   I would argue that hai is best on pre-nerf syndra. IIRC that was what he played when they beat SSB   He's a strong pick, especially against lower mobilty teams. He excels at being an anti-bully in lane (pretty much impossible to push him out of lane), that can scale into either an unkillable super tank, or a monstrous burst threat depending on the build. He's also incredibly snowbally if you get ahead.  In teamfights you want to be a massive wall that body blocks all the skillshots for your team. You'll get kited out if you try to dive so it's usually best just to peel for your carries (especially since you can shred tanks with your true damage nuke).    Yeah it's pretty much that. There are websites that archive a lot of the links to deep web sites. Unless things have changed in the 2 or so years since I last was on it. Seeing a video of a guy finding a roadkill fox, taking it home, and fucking it was the last straw for me.   It's satire, you shouldn't get so riled up about it.   You could literally defend an Inhib turret from the fountain using your ult.   I agree with what your saying, but look at some of the numbers post nerf.   Kassadin ult range: 450   Cool down:7/5/3  Mana cost 60 x2 up to a total of 980  Nidalee pounce range: 375 (750 against hunted)  Cool down: 5  Mana cost: 0  In short, the champion who's entire kit is based around his mobility is basically outclassed by Nidalee. This is not even mentioning the fact that Nidalee has much higher burst at all points of the game (a level 9 spear will out damage a level 13 QE from Kassadin alone). She also has the benefit of a strong early/mid game, where Kassadin needs to make it to at least the 25 minute mark to be effective.   I don't think that build is bad, but you have to remember that you will be missing out on a ton of damage for early ganks, which often will mean the difference between a kill or not. You could offset this by rushing your trinity force before completing juggernaut, but you may find that you might not have a real powerspike for any mid-game fights.    Yes I do, I also know that it is his ultimate ability, does neglible damage, and has insane mana costs. I'm not saying that Kassadin doesn't need a nerf, but this is overkill.   Kassadin has been balanced around having a weak early/mid game, and a strong late game. Making his ult range go 450/550/650 (instead of a static 450 like on PBE) will still be a net nerf, even at max rank. This will still let him be able to actually ult onto ADCs in teamfights (as all adc's will outrange riftwalk if the original changes go through) but will also make his early/mid game weaker as he can't make the same sort of jungle escapes, or roam as well until he's max rank. This will also cut back on snowballing, making him easier to shut down.    Yep, all meta ADCs out range riftwalk now.   They basically halved his riftwalk distance   To be fair, a girl challenger is *somewhat* special, when you factor in how few girls are likely in challenger in the first place.   And UOL 2-0d TSM, yet TSM is ahead of UOL. Things have changed since IEM's, and this is coming from a C9 fan.   They're not as strong as they were during the league of hyper carries late season 4, but ADC is still a strong role. Unfortunately, the current meta is pretty harsh to adc's with dive comps being popular. Every team has a Vi/Jarvan or Lissandra to lock you down and make you miserable.  The best ADC at the moment is Graves, other top-tier ones are Sivir, Jinx, Corki, and Kalista ( only in competitive/duo queues)   I'm just curious, where would you find room for CDR in your build? ROA into Zhonyas is non-negotiable, you need Deathcap and Void staff to do real damage, and then your left with one slot, which is usually filled with a Lich Bane, GA, Banshees, etc.   Unfortunately, there is no real ADC like old Tristana. She had a combination of damage and safety that no other ADC really had. The closest IMO is actually Cait. Strong lane, weak mid game, strong late game. Very safe,  and high range as well. Unfortunately she isn't really a 'hypercarry', but her damage is still respectable.   Sirchez plays him to success in masters. He blind picks him and everything. If you like him enough, you can play him in pretty much any elo (you'll start to have troubles the higher you rise, but that won't be for quite a while)   "Wow this noob Lee tried to insec their ADC, but he failed his flash. I swear he didn't hit a single Q all game, and didn't even gank bot despite them having no wards."   Especially with such a low-kill game   I would take a frozen heart. Sion has enough CC as it is that he doesn't particularily need the slow, and the extra armor is just so valuable on a tank, especially one with as much natural health as Sion.   Also, another point I just want to make about the manamune is that all of Sions abilities are AOE, so he can't even proc the bonus damage on anything but his autos.   There's basically nothing riot can do (besides an absurd nerf or complete rework) that will make kassadin not viable. I say go for him. He's really fun to play, and fairly easy to pick up. He's also got a high skillcap (not in a mechanical sense, more of just knowing his limits and when to go in/out) so he's rewarding to master. Just remember that he has a long ramp-up time, (especially if they keep nerfing his base damages). You can't do too much until ROA + Zhonyas, and you don't really start dealing strong damage until over 3 items in.    5% bonus AR/MR  is literally negligible if you're not building full tank. With a GA, and armour/mr runes, you're getting around 3 armour and MR each. That is so little it's almost non existent (at the point in the game where you would have a GA)   well, it does work for Nidalee :^)   Also, it's been seen a lot on vi's and other jungles recently, as it lets her farm the jungle, gank, and regen the lost health so she can remain farming. It also gives her much more health from her passive   Poke comps   Ap lee song support   Crit isn't optimal, but it is still a great stat on nasus. It's absurd how much damage you will deal with a crit Q, as it will include the AD steroid from your ult. I have literally one-shot a sona with a crit-Q + sheen proc from triforce. You're right about the stacks not being added to the crit damage however.   While I agree with what your saying, It doesn't fit the parameters of your question. Let's say you get camped and end up very gold starved(like under 3k gold at the 15 minute mark) and a dragon fight breaks out. Would you rather have a rumble with sorc shoes and guise, or a jaz with a sheen and phage? Yes, jax will eventually become a beast either way, but the game will snowball out of control before them if he is starved.   Rumble is probably the best 'meta' champ to be gold starved. He only really needs sorc shoes and haunting guise to be effective.   Jax is extremely gold dependent. He needs a good 7k gold to hit his powespike.   Keane is known for wrecking challenger players as urgot   Hasn't lost a single LCS Game on him   Nobody really punishes him though in low Elo   Hell, I finished my season as a lowly silver, got placed bronze 3, and carried myself out easily. 90% irelia win rate, 100% nasus, 75% Ahri/Kog/Morg. As a diamond you can easily smash lane and carry from there. Plus, if you're respectful and are carrying, bronze players will listen to your calls all the time.   To be fair to hai, kass has a fairly hard lane against corki.   Maple street basically fucked himself anyhow   Rush did show up today though   Janna will remain, purely because of these aggressive supports. She offers the disengage to make someone like Leona useless   That will still take a solid ~13 minutes to get under IDEAL conditions. With the amount of pressure riven can put on him, you can delay that much much longer.   He's actually fairly weak at the moment, purely because of the popularity of Morellonomicon. His ult regen will almost always be reduced by half, unless you pop it extremely early. He will still be a unkillable super tank, just slightly less effective then he was in s4. Plus other tanks such as Maokai and Gnar bring so much more then him in terms of utility.   Abusing your E is the biggest point. Irelia is weak early game in most matchups, until you get several points in your W. Against strong laners you can farm fairly Safely with your Q, and disengage with your E.  You can usually look to all-in your laner at levels 4,5,7,9, when she gets additional true damage from her W. Don't worry about being pushed under your turret, as irelia is one of the best turret farmers in the entire game + it makes it incredibly easy for you to set up ganks when they're that pushed.   Shyvs E is an on-hit buff, Kalistas E is a secure that takes time to ramp up. Completely different things.   If you have to have a fed support though, annie is probably the best choice   Shyvs E is an on-hit buff though, that made her clears stupidly fast.   It only works when your team has baron control though.   Show us a screenshot of the scripting message then.   You will still have a much stronger teamfight then the team that will likely be lacking the utility that most top laners bring      The standard build is Triforce into BOTRK. From there it's mostly situational, but the most common is then IE into phantom dancer (gives higher dps then last whisper even against tanks) however, last whisper is still a good choice, as it is often stronger then pd when your W is down/you can't afford to auto constantly. You should pick up a defensive item early on as you already do high dps but have low survivabililty.     It'll be a must buy for me. It pays for itself in basically 3 minutes. 250 Gold is enough to give up as a solo laner without the fear of falling behind that a sightstone will give you.   Have you ever fired a gun before? The skills it takes to be a sharpshooter are vastly different then it takes to be a league of legends player.   Leave regular sports and E-sports separate. They're both activities that take a lot of skill and practise, but still aren't nearly close enough to be put in the same category. Maybe someday we will see an E-sports Olympics or something, just preferably not in the same showing as a 100 metre sprint or swimming competitions.   I think annie might be a good choice for you. Easy mechanics, stupid burst, great engage, everything you would need for an all-in comp. As a bonus she can also be played support as well.   I've been playing her in lane since the patch. Since you can't reliably use your passive for any extended period of time in lane you really need the tear. Plus it gives you a MASSIVE damage increase when it is completed. In jungle eve (which is weaker then lane eve imo)  I would skip it though, you can't afford the early 720 gold for no combat stats on someone who already struggles in her clear.   Evelynn actually is pretty threatening if built as an assassin now. A BOTRK, Muramana and sheen will literally let her kill a carry in less then a second.   Silver 3  5/5  Bronze 3.   Guess the climb from bronze 4 to silver 3 during preseason was useless. Only positive is I'm gaining 25lp per win and only losing 13   To be honest, even as an 'off-meta' pick, he just doesn't really have anything going for him. His attack speed scaling is horrendous, (.777 at level 18), he has low range (550 is the norm), no mobility at all, and no AD scaling. He has literally 0 traits you would want in an adc, besides some small self peel, which you won't need as nobody will focus you due to dealing zero damage. Velkoz is just completely outclassed. Most off meta picks like adc twisted fate or adc ahri have things going for themselves that make them not dead-weight. Ahri has a massive mid game spike and insane kiting and self peel, and twisted fate has an attack speed steroid, self peel, and a decent magic damage on-hit steriod.    You can go ahead and try it if you want, just it really isn't worth the effort.   Nautilus probably takes the cake. He's got an AOE knock up, a snare (that can be used repeatedly on different people, a AOE slow, and a pull + gapcloser.    Kog'maw has all of that as well, and he also has a much larger range, better attack speed scaling and actual steroids.    Step 1: Get stomped 0/4 in Lane  Step 2: Hit level 6  Step 3: Roam bot  Step 4:????  Step 5: Finish the game 20/5 ( the last death was a BM victory fountain dive   Well I got dumpstered last week by a full AD Leona, so it can work. IMO the problem with it would be that you would be a fairly weak laner, with a long ramp-up time. Once you get a couple items, you should be quite scary though. You have enough crowd control to sit on a carry and kill them, while still being hard to kill with your natural tankyness.   He was disabled for the weekend due to a bug. Sion is basically a 'secondary Maokai', and so filled in his role of being a unkillable CC tank.   MF is much like Varus though. A lane bully (you can lane swap to avoid her) with inconsistent mobility and too little damage to make up for it. The only ADC's without a dash that see play are Kog'Maw (insane dps, usually have comps built around him), Sivir (Ult can be used as a escape, has spell shield to avoid being caught), and Jinx (very high damage, has some self-peel, passive gives her needed mobility as well)   I haven't lost a game with adc ahri (in normals of course).  It's actually somewhat decent. You have an absurd powerspike when you get a sheen. (Hitting a charm post-6 is basically a guaranteed kill, especially if your support has any secondary CC. You snowball exceptionally hard, just make sure you don't make it to late game as even ashe will outdamage ahri after 4 items.   And then building full damage and literally one-shotting squishies   They'll pick it up, I guarantee it. If cloud 9 doesn't finish top 3 in this split, I will quit league of legends and only play train simulator 2015 for the rest of the year.   It feels like their team fighting is off sync. Getting split up, not focusing down the right people, etc.   What could sneaky even do against a Zed, Kassadin and Vi as a Kog'maw? He goes within 2 miles of a teamfight and gets blown up.   He did great with Orianna during IEMs   To be fair, when you have a Janna, Lulu and Nunu for peel, and a gnar to use J4 ults against him, it's pretty hard to actually get near Kog   On the other hand. They based their entire team comp around this substitute. If he played badly they were screwed.   I didn't see Lemon hit a single hook in those teamfights   Jax vs Nasus is pretty much always in Nasuses favor. Jax relies on outscaling every one of his lane opponents in order to be successful, and Nasus is pretty much the one champ he doesn't outscale. He's very attack speed reliant, so wither wrecks him. His counterstrike doesn't stop the damage from Nasus's Q as well. Nasus also stacks resists, and since Jax doesn't build pen he'll struggle damaging him late game. Jax can still win a 1v1 duel during parts of the mid game, around the 1-2 item mark, but any earlier and any later he will get beaten.   Then they have the right to refuse entry to the country.   TIL XWX is European   It reminds me of Blood moon Akali, which is my favorite splash in the game.   Damn that nidalee splash is beautiful, reminds me of Blood Moon Akali a lot.   I don't know about you guys, but I personally like it.   Max Q first for stronger ganks and faster clears. Max W second as it makes you SO much tankier for mid-game teamfights. Max E last as it doesn't really give you much bonus per level, it's more of a one point wonder.   Well who else was there even open in jungle? Everyone was basically banned out.   Renekton is THE pick into jax. He just didn't play the lane very well.   You know your in trouble when your Renekton loses lane to a Jax.   Vi and Fiddle are both top-tier solo queue picks. Warwick was unbelievably broken when they first released the new jungle itemization (~62% win rate and 90% ban rate), but then the nerfbat hit both him and the items, and now he's weaker as a champion then in season 4, but he's arguably more effective due to being one if the few junglers that doesn't get his ass kicked by the new jungle. Since there's also less early pressure he can powerfarm to  6 without the game snowballing out of control before then as well.  After the adc item changes late season 4, you should never be rushing bloodthirster anymore. On Sivir (and the majority of ADC's) the standard build path is now Infinity EdgeStattik Shiv/Phantom dancerLast whisperBloodthirster into whatever for the last item. Only real exceptions to this are Ezreal/Corki/Kog who rush Triforce, Twitch/Vayne who rush BOTRK, and Kalista (a new adc) who can either rush BOTRK, or a different build based around rushing Runaans Hurricane.   In jungle, Jarvan, Rek'Sai, and Lee are god tier right now. The new jungle hurts like a bitch, and those three are ones that can reliably clear it and still have some form of early pressure. In adc, Graves, Sivir, Corki, Ezreal are the contested picks.    What I did to learn is I spammed a bunch of games on kog'maw. You have no mobility, are squishy as fuck, and have only a slow for CC. Literally the only things keeping you alive in solo queue will be your positioning and your kiting. After  learning him, your mechanics will be much stronger.   Also, I would advise you to just try out other champions instead of 'maining' someone to 30. You'll learn more that way, by knowing the strengths and weaknesses of different champions. You'll eend up playing several hundred games pre-30, and odds are you'll end up bored of her after a while anyhow. I thought I would do the same as you with shyvana/akali when I started, but now I haven't even played either of them in months.    They essentially nerfed the double Q proc with the E changes. You can't Q...R-auto-Q-E anymore for that instaburst. You have to wait that extra second for the second auto.   The problem with irelia jungle is that jax jungle has the exact same play style, and outclasses her in every way, He has better sustain due to his E, faster clears cause his passive and ult, and more consistent ganks. Nothing is stopping you from playing her there, especially in normals, it's just subpar.   He is definitely viable, his problem is just how one-dimensional he is. There isn't much difference between a decent garen and a good garen, or a good garen and a great garen, so you won't get as much benefit from maining him.   I'm pretty sure c9 took a game off of samsung blue, which was considered a top team. NJWS was still a fairly strong team, and they beat them as well. I totally agree with you that they should not have been ranked so high, but you have to give them some credit.   Assassin lane eve is sleeper OP   How did irelia tp to baron if they had no vision of it?   In short, sheen gives her higher burst compared to phage. Once you have your ult, it gives you a stronger all-in as well. However, buying a sheen gives you weaker sustained damage pre-6, so onlydo short trades (E-Auto), against many lanes.   Top lane is honestly 'everything goes' right now. Gnar, Maokai, Lissandra, Irelia, are some of the common ones.  Mid has a lot of Azir, Leblanc, Zed, etc.   Adc is basically Corki, Graves, Sivir and Ezreal.  Jungle is Jarvan, Lee, Rek'sai  Support is Janna, thresh, annie is on the verge of being FOTM.   I'm not a trick2g fan, but from my times I have watched his stream he does actually teach a lot, and is one of the most informative streamers IMO. It's just that you never see that on his highlight videos.  	101
 Those coke rewards tho...   Worked like a charm, thanks and keep up the good work!  	2
 At what point do you stop liking movies? Can you tell the difference between a film from 1989 and 1990? Do you really even like movies if you are willing to disregard 70% of the history of film?   one word.   Nazis.   Yeah ... back in the 40's ... pretty common knowledge.   Would you have been bothered by The Long Halloween or Year One's departure from typical Batman fare when it was released? Or would you welcome the new take?  Why do you think that the MCU's films are more in line with writers like Stan Lee than someone like Brian Michael Bendis?   How do you judge which version of a comic book character is the most true, since the characters evolve and change wildly from author to author? Do you think Birdman would have topped the box office in the early 90's?   Do you feel that the recent superhero films are typically not bringing a fresh take to their source material? Are they too faithful?    Both Schindler's list and Jurassic Park are based on books, one of which is based on a book about something that actually happened.     Moonraker has a ton of Pepsi product placement I believe    The Samurai Trilogy by Hiroshi Inagaki  Man with No Name by Sergio Leone  Vengeance Trilogy by Chan-Wook Park  Jackie Chan's Police Story Trilogy: Police Story 1,2   Supercop    If looking at the sea motifs are your thing: Check out Takeshi Kitano's filmography  Also, they're great movies.    Sir Ian,  Ive tried your acting advise from Extras, but it doesn't seem to work for me. Any further advice?  How different did the mood on the Hobbit sets feel compared to LOTR?  Do you and other Knights occasionally gather to fight crime together?    He looks like he has a very tiny head compared to his body.   	12

 David Lee. Hate everything about him.    100%. watched this movie at least once a week when I was younger. would definitely pay for the theater experience   DAMN JR. SO DISRESPECTFUL   yeah that's the only reason he's in haha. he wanted that one   bets on lebron missing second on purpose to get the board?!?! Nevermind lol   Lebron in just for the triple double lol   Lebron boutta go from being guarded by Jimmy Butler to being guarded by Demare Carrol. hahaha he gonna be just fine fg% wise   Even games where it looks like hes playing terrible, finds a way to get that close to a trip dub. crazy   MY PENIS CAN ONLY GET SO ERECT. IM SAVING MY DAUGHTER FOR YOU DELLY   holy shit. like, why? 2 seconds left. go at the rim   they've been sayin it since 2010 and it was never a reality. blinded by names. now theyre all old and bad and they gotta break up the band   dont go too crazy   Hot damn, we have a winner   DELLY OH MY GOD MARRY MY FUTURE DAUGHTER   Who's the Holy Spirit of our team? MozGOD, Outback Jesus... but who is the third of the Trinity?   eeehhhhhh debatable   "horrible agent but a beautiful man" doesnt at least make you chuckle? haha   Confirmed.    hahahah it's funnier because of your name   as long as she doesnt talk   lol   you're right. i'm sorry. bad idea. but if it happens tho? be pretty awesome. definitely prefer 12 feet and in   I just want Lebron to come out and stroke a few 3's back to back to back and step on their throats. kill any confidence they might still have and gain a rhythm in his jumper. perfect scenario   Lebrons gotta fund his jumper at some point between now and the next series. I dont know how many more games we can squeeze out with him shooting this bad   dont play Kyrie again, Blatt!!!!!! he needs rest for next series!!!!   Lebron needs to learn the art of the 10 foot pull up. Attack that baseline drive but instead of getting clogged up under the rim, pull up real quick outside the paint for that touch shot   IMAN SHUMPERT MUTHA FUCKAS. YOU DONT CLOSELINE THE BEST FLAT TOP IN THE GAME AND EXPECT NOT TO GET GOT. BLAP BLAP   Is Kyrie my new favorite player? Because this is how you become my new favorite player.    WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON   Yeah. we played bad. Lebron took bad shots and got in semi foul trouble along with mozgod. TT, JJ, and Kyrie locked it down tho. POSITIVE VIBES EVERYBODY, MAINTAIN POSITIVE VIBES   PUMP FAKE AND DRIVE. LITERALLY THE MOST EFFECTIVE MOVE IN BASKETBALL.    Okay, so this is my least favorite version of Lebron. He'll turn it around and win this game, but I just hate when he opts for transitions 3's and deep 2's so early in the game.    I think the immature thing to do is to care what people on the internet think and do in response to what you think and do.    exactly   she's adorably attractive.    Gorgeous, chrome plated horse whip   I think Delly is the most liked player on this team by his teammates. Lebron was talkin him up about how he's the toughest player on the team and a lotta "my boy" and stuff from other guys. These guys are really coming together and forming that championship bond you want to see. Really cool   Now that, is a helluva car   Exactly. Bron took Eric Snow, Larry Hughes, Donyell Marshall, and freakin Joe Smith to the NBA Finals when he was, what, 21? 22 maybe? That's incredible.    Put him on the block and let him go to work. been killin all game when we do that   DELLY AND TT's CHEMISTRY IS UNBELIEVABLE. LOVE THOSE GUYS   LEBRON GOES HARD IN THE MUTHA FUCKIN PAINT BITCG   okay. time to go to the rim   But Lebron drives in past Butler and Noah hacks the shit out of him and no call. Dont understand   When Bron is "banged up" he always finds a way to have one of those games. Love it   Lebron :D   Yes agreed. That scene was too much   Such a Lebron thing to do   "You, you take picture with Mozgod. Will be good for you, come." I love the great and powerful Moz   Yeah exactly. Hope he comes back strong next season   U-kendrick lamar   The thing is, he knows it isn't a rule that you can't use the review time as a timeout of sorts. Everybody uses it, so you have to assume it can be beneficial for both sides. Also, he was the one begging for a review because he thought more time should have been taken off, not put on. So, it is  his fault that we had time for Lebron to command the ball. No reason to be salty at anyone but himself   Is Chris Bosh one of the most likable players in the league? Seems like everyone genuinely wishes the best for him and wants him to succeed. It's actually really awesome to see   My entire life, the Cowboys have sucked   tasty smores?   bet I can guess your age   So mad it's not on Netflix anymore. Never got around to watching it but so wanted to   the fact that no character is likable is kinda why i like it so much. in a very twisted way   Also my favorite Nolan film. I thought it was awesome and thought provoking   Excellent movie. Casting was perfect   Love Zombieland. Really surprised me   Those movies are fantastic and hilarious. The Rodrick character was perfectly cast   Interstellar when Coop is watching the recording from Murph. My emotions were so confused. How do I react to my daughter being the same age as I am? Such an unusual concept but I was crying way more than I should. After realizing he missed 23 years of her life in such a short span of time, makes you understand how fleeting life is. McConaughey did that scene extremely well too   Fuck Disney for making me deal with a love story followed by a depressing death in the span of 4 minutes. Just plain rude   Crap. Forgot about that scene. Feels   The father-son scenes with Costner are the best parts of the movie. He did excellent   Oh god I balled like an infant. Done so damn well   Yes, this, 100%.    So, just to clarify, you're saying if it was a completely different story and absolutely nothing about the film was the same that any character could feasibly be the main focus? Can you confirm?   I think you're forgetting just how tiny he is. And a big man with bad feet don't last long anyway. (ie. Yao Ming)   I think Brent Barry is far and away the best analyst/color commentator doing playoff games right now. Least biased, most insightful, knows when to shut up, and just generally a good listen during a game. Also, Ian Eagle is a great play-by-play guy. Watching this Wiz/Hawks game and I love the commentating    Well, that's a shame.    But they go in for their college accomplishments. Not the culmination of their collegiate and professional careers. If a player is going to be inducted based on their professional career, they have to actually earn it.    all im saying is, he's 27 years old and the past two seasons have been his come up. he hasnt done anything except break some 3 pt shooting records. that doesnt equate to HOF status   Yeah that's true. I guess I just dont see him getting enough space to get 3's off. Hand check rules were very different and him being virtually 7 feet tall, keepin that handle would be difficult   Pippen and Rodman come to mind. But if he drives into the paint against the Pistons and gets beat up like MJ and Scottie did, he's done   very different circumstances   I think you cut his minutes in half in game 5. Delly has been playing like a champ   Oh so Derrick Rose is a hall of famer? god that term is thrown out so much, it means nothing. you have to actually earn a spot in the hall of fame over the course of your career. one season doesnt make you a hall of famer   But injury prone. He could impose his will physically and hang with those guys for sure, but he just wouldnt have a very long career   You think glass tiger KD is gonna take some hits from the bad boys? lol nah   Yo that's an instrumental track from the Interstellar soundtrack. That's cool. Much inspire   And it makes no sense that they dont like him. He is the polar opposite of a Gregg Popavich who is a douche bag to everyone who asks him a question. Blatt is thoughtful and answers every question with charisma. I dont get it   Wasn't he trying to open a tab? not order one?   About to have my second ACL surgery. Believe me, Derrick Rose's determination and dedication is of the upmost inspiration and I wish him all the best. And I'm a die hard Lebron fan.    no dude, im askin the guy who posted the comment what he's saying. read what he said. grammatically it makes no sense   Wh... what?   Bruh. game 6, 2012, Boston. Most pressure he's ever had on a game in his life. 45 pts, 15 boards, 5 assists. I like that Lebron   HAHAHAHHAHAH HELL YEAH CAVS FANS   yeah, the iso hesitation jab step pull ups are rhythm killers individually and as an offense. take a rhythm jumper or make a quick decision. dont hesitate whatever you do    CATCH. THE FUCKING. BALL. OH MY GOD   Is Tristan my new favorite player? I think he's my new favorite player. Anyone confirm?   totally agree. just like to see more effort close out wise   tristans floater game on fleek tho   Too many open 3's from the Bulls... Good run to tie it up but we cant allow a 3 point shooter to shoot with no one within 10 feet of him   haha youre shitting me right? just turn the game on before that post turnover? get outta here   can somebody fuckin be strong with the damn ball. this is bullshit   God I love Bob's   Like as extra scenes or a bonus feature or something? I was curious why he was such a small part of the film   Bruh, Lebron shot 8 for 25. 7 TO's. that's not a season average. Kyrie cant jump or sprint with one foot. that's not something that happened in the regular season. dont try to act like theyre playing normal. if Lebron and Kyrie play like the duo theyve been all year, this isnt a game.  And I'm perfectly content being down 1-2 because we have the best player on that planet on our squad. Also, cleveland doesnt have a home court advantage. their home crowd was basically terrible so those first two were neutral site games as far as im concerned.  In the end, being down 1 to 2 without a 17 and 10 guy, without a play making shooter for the first two, and with a plethora of injuries isn't the worst it can be. I have faith in King James.     are you? sounds like a pretty biased take on officiating from your end too, boss. they called a foul to make up for the missed goaltend, by the way. watch it back, literally nobody touched him. but, all that aside, yall won the game. congrats. yall got 50 from your top two, we got 38. we got out rebounded badly. had basically zero fast break points. got out scored by 15 on 2nd chance points. and we still only lost on a hail mary. im content with that. the question is, are you? just hope it doesnt scare you that Lebron and Kyrie have played like complete shit for 3 games and it's still a close series. we'll see what happens when they get it going   we were in the game all bc of lebron too.   	102

          Too soon.   I loved Hurt Locker - or maybe hated (in a good way) it because it was quite intense.   I've heard this a lot of times about the movie. I haven't seen it, so I guess when I do, I won't expect anything.   I totally agree with you. Not to say I didn't enjoy watching it, but it was overhyped.                        Did you say, "GTFO"?   The first thing that came to mind! Damn, their copywriter/s must have issues.            Exactly. He knows what to do with his players. He knows how to pick his players.

I think the resetting, etc. will work.    It used to work before with the same number, so I guess they had done that. It just started happening recently; maybe in the last 3 weeks or so.   Well said. Just enjoy the ride and stop nitpicking, right?   This is cool- didn't know it before. Resetting now!   For some contacts, when I send iMessages, I see the 'delivered' status but they don't go through the phone; only on their laptop. When they send me a message it goes through, though. Anyone else has this issue? A fix?   I never liked Kobe either, but yeah, can't ignore his talent. And he's grown up quite a bit, too.      Who wantsmore smoreos?   How so?            Keep it man. One of these days, you will need to listen to the song and regret having deleted it.    Props, not only for doing the right thing but for going the extra mile(s)!   Not even a shadow of a thought.          My heart goes out to you and your family. It's been only 2 months since my mom passed away after a year of a horrible battle with gastric cancer. I may not be able to help with getting in touch with the Spurs, but know you're not alone.  Good luck.   Le sigh.       Now that you put it that way, the idea actually sounds good. Probably the hype that turned me off.         Why not? Unless they're total idiots, which I doubt they are, the inventors would have designed the charger to be as safe as a lighter - at the very least.   Ditto! Btw, my first MacBook was a refurbished white one, too. Fell in love. Never looked back. (P.S. It's still working today, many MacBooks later.)   sad with an m; works I guess      I've always liked the bathing and motivation comparison.         I've always found the Haka to be fascinating, but this...   I was going to ask if there were number assignments, but come to think of it, I wouldn't want to play with the dice regularly - they're too good to get worn out. Awesome stuff!   LOL. First thing that came to mind!   That works, too.         "they just don't give a cent about environment" In some cases, yes. Lack of education. Lack of awareness.   The gov't is corrupt. Period. And, yes, this won't be fixed for a long time. Maybe not even in the next few generations.   Unfortunately, very much a reality in parts of the metro.      You've won.      I'm with you. I was just talking about this with my friend, and while I do love the aluminum look, there's something about black.      That is wonderful! Did you feel the feels? ;)      Need one of those!      That really does suck!!   Yeah, now that you guys mention it, why do I need a certain age. I was just on a Michael Jackson binge the past few days, and I was thinking whether it's okay to play his music to my 2- and 4-year-old nephews now.  	75
 So, you are a Sun denier?   zzz...   Coulter lists all the reasons why she says soccer is not a real sport. Among them: "Individual achievement is not a big factor."  "The blame is dispersed and almost no one scores anyway," Coulter writes. "There are no heroes, no losers, no accountability, and no child's fragile self-esteem is bruised. There's a reason perpetually alarmed women are called 'soccer moms,' not 'football moms.'"  Another: It's boring, she claims.  "If Michael Jackson had treated his chronic insomnia with a tape of Argentina vs. Brazil instead of Propofol, he'd still be alive, although bored," Coulter quips.  It's not violent enough for Coulter.  "The prospect of either personal humiliation or major injury is required to count as a sport," she writes. "Most sports are sublimated warfare."  In American football, she writes, "ambulances carry off the wounded. After a soccer game, every player gets a ribbon and a juice box."  And despite the stellar ratings that Sunday's USA-Portugal game received in the United States (18.2 million viewers, according to ESPN), Coulter doesn't believe the sport is actually catching on here.  "The same people trying to push soccer on Americans are the ones demanding that we love HBO's 'Girls,' light-rail, Beyonc and Hillary Clinton," she writes. "The number of New York Times articles claiming soccer is 'catching on' is exceeded only by the ones pretending women's basketball is fascinating."  Coulter claims she's not the only one bored by soccer in the States. "One group of sports fans with whom soccer is not 'catching on' at all, is African-Americans," Coulter writes. "They remain distinctly unimpressed by the fact that the French like it.  "If more 'Americans' are watching soccer today, it's only because of the demographic switch effected by Teddy Kennedy's 1965 immigration law," Coulter adds. "I promise you: No American whose great-grandfather was born here is watching soccer. One can only hope that, in addition to learning English, these new Americans will drop their soccer fetish with time."    Trump/Christie 2016  *Listen Motherfuckers, Shut up and Sit Down!*  	4
 Also went to that high school.  The fact that Snoop used to go there is one thing I like to brag to my friends about.      Fun fact: People usually don't give a damn when I mention it...   No plans of going there then?    I was hoping that everyone would be discouraged to go therefore less people will go. I can dream   Anyone around the San Jose best buy? As of now I know it hasn't started yet but let me know how the lines are   We can and I would encourage the community to form opinions.  The only thing is that we shouldn't be too critical of the product.  If anything it's another flavor of smash to play, not everyone's cup of tea but it's something.  And if nintendo is really pushing forth this whole ideal of bridging the smash community I would bet that patches are going to be a very prevalent part of this game.    Too lazy to make a Conker game, make it yourself.   How easy is it to pick up and play torchlight 1 for someone who doesn't have any experience with ARPGs    Sadly yes :/  	8
 The best alternative to iTunes is anything other than iTunes.  Seriously...syncing music?  Who the fuck thought that was a good idea?  Plug your device in, drag and drop your music over to the Android device, unplug, fire up Google Music and go.   Can you choose a background other than black or white on Windows Phone yet?   It's not you.  Jellybean had "Project Butter" which aimed to make animations, etc more smooth without interrupting the main thread.  KitKat had an aim to reduce memory usage, and allow Android to still perform well on devices with 512mb of memory.  My ORIGINAL Galaxy S has a build of Android KitKat and it's perfectly usable today...4 years later.   I'm actually using a bluetooth OBDII app, and an app that allows the widgets to be set to non-interactive and float over every app that I bring up so that when I'm in the car I can see the data while my GPS app is up.  I can also float things like my Pandora widget so that I can thumbs up/down/next track while in any other app.  Tons of other things I can do with Gesture-Control app like swiping from the edge of the screen to bring up specific groups of widgets, etc.  And this is something that doesn't require root at all.  I can also float my app windows on the tablet, or tile them so one app is up top, and another is down below.  I also have Wireless charging, NFC, etc.   The author of the framework has a preliminary build working on L, since the release.  He's simply not releasing it yet in case something major changes in the ART libraries that he's gotta account for.  He'll also be discontinuing support for dalvik because it basically requires handling two very different code bases.   Active series got recalled because of their claim about water resistance up to X depth.  The USB cover was badly designed and could still let water in.  Still a great phone otherwise.   You can get WiFi modules for $4 for the Arduino.  The ESP8266 has some active development going on for it, but you'll need to make sure you supply it with 3.3v and not blow it out with 5v.   Ah, so you're one of those.  Not only do you downvote people who have differing opinions, you stalk them to other threads!  That's awesome!  Good on you!   I'm not sure. :(   Holy fuck, that was 7 years ago?!  Good fucking god...I remember that whole fiasco pretty well.  It was awesome seeing the community rise up against the very admins of the site it was using to post that.  Eventually they folded.   Honestly, that's how digg ended up crashing and burning in a big ball of flame.    For instance, how do we know Vastra and Jenny are together? Its not because they act like a loving couple its because they tell each other they are married every 30 seconds.  I thought that was merely put in for people who weren't already fans, just watching the show on-a-whim with someone else so they could keep up. :[  I hated crap like BattleStar galactica because I could never catch up to what was what, who was who, why anything was going on, etc.  If I would have started from the beginning, maybe that would be different, but I didn't have that luxury at the time I was interested in it.   So, you're saying he's too obvious, but he's too complex...how does that even make sense?   I don't see any of that in moffat's stories.  I see very multidimensional characters which span in development over the course of entire seasons.   What _exactly_ is everyones problem with Moffat anyways?   Explosion at [7:17](http://youtu.be/5t6deOZloBU?t=7m17s)      $3.80 for a screen brightness changer?  Jesus fuck.

Better than the lady that decided to follow the car in front of her, get in a right hand turning lane, as I get over, she decides "oh wait, I'm not turning after all!" and slowly drifts back into the lane she was in only to pull down her window and frantically curse me out.  I was fucking watching you the whole god damn time lady, don't you even start with me.

Not being able to consent, is not being able to provide consent.  Regardless.  If someone were semi-drunk and didn't technically say no, they've probably got equal mental state to some hormone ridden teenage boy.   The 3D printed castle was not this week, it was 2 weeks ago: https://plus.google.com/103120178378541114779/posts  (This is a link to where it was announced, by the inventor/author of this particular technique)   When people clamor on about Ruby, they generally aren't gushing over the language itself, but are rather focused on the "Rails" portion of "Ruby on Rails".    Python has tons of equivalents but as /u/stahlous has stated, there's so much now going on at the client side that it matters much less what server-side language you use.  Pick whichever one you feel most comfortable with, especially if you're just learning.   Yeah, don't know why out of ALL the pictures on that page, reddit chose to put THAT one as the thumbnail.  I was trying to post something that was neutral (honestly knowing that most people are going to be voting yes).  But yeah, vote yes on 2!   Also, important dates - don't forget to vote!  http://elections.mytimetovote.com/dates/florida.html  It's still a ways off, but elections generally have a lower turnout on non-presidential election days.  Which means that your vote is worth even more.  Don't let them hoodwink you into not voting either.  There are going to be some nasty tricks this year (as there have been every year).  *Edit* Don't know why reddit chose "vote no on 2" for the thumbnail...obviously people should be voting yes. :D      [](/chibipinkie) We must dig deeper!   PLA is already UV resistant.  It's the IR spectrum that causes heat.  ABS, it's just easier to use black, though a UV spraypaint on colors is an awesome idea! :D   How much C and how much Java do you know? You need to be proficient in both.    Being PLA out in the hot sun, I doubt it will last very long - but still, awesome work!  Worst that happens is it melts/breaks off and you print it in a better material (Black ABS, specifically black because the carbon protects the ABS from UV light which can cause it to degrade in the sun)   I never did get that _amazing_ spellcaster dagger from Kara on my mage.  Eventually stopped farming it, and got accepted into a guild that was farming The Black Temple and had much better passed to me on an alt run (my main was a prot pally that tanked for them)  We exploited the hell out of Kara too, by walljumping over near Nightbane and skipping most of the instance.   It didn't hurt that my wife was a healer, and I was a tank.  I didn't suffer through the crap like most people complain about.  Tanking and healing was a much more skilled affair than DPS anyways.  It was never difficult to stay out of the fire while keeping a rotation going.  We got to the point where I would just pull ahead of her while she was drinking, I'd chain-pop cooldowns to ease up the strain, and when she caught up she'd top me off.  Most of my experience in vanilla was chain-pulling, never stopping, and finishing instances in the same 15 minutes you got when someone had to go eat dinner.  My wife and I were far more popular in WoW than we are while away from the computer for that very reason.  And yet another reason for me loving the old days.  I built a reputation as a fucking amazing tank (and she as a healer), and people would always be dependent on me for getting shit done.  Eventually I went all the way to Vanilla Naxx on my warrior, sunwell on my paladin (prot back then was SO overpowered), and downing 25 lich king HM on my warrior again.  I quit after that because suddenly most of the user base wasn't interested in hard modes.  They got to see the pretty places, and didn't care much for actual challenges...   I enjoyed the grinds, and enjoyed the days when they made content that only the best players could see.  Sunwell was an excellent example.  You only saw it if you were good.  Sure - you might be able to see it once the next expansion came out, but you never got to benefit from it at that point.  Always having something to strive for, kept me playing.  Now, 99% of the userbase plays the LFR version, that's been stripped down with no mechanics and suddenly...well, they've seen the content.  So they stop playing.  They stop striving for something better.  There's no locked out content that drives players to strive for more.   The older players that were leaving the game, were leaving the game for the exact reasons you say they were changing it to get new players in.  It was all downhill from the point they added the LFG auto-matching tool, and auto-ported everyone in and out of the instance.  They tried making it so you at least had to visit the instance first, but now you don't even have to do that.  Did spamming /LFG suck?  Yes, it did.  But it sucked enough that people friended one another, got to know each other, and didn't just kick you out of a group for nothing.  The sense of community and friendship was much stronger back then.  Now, nobody talks, it's difficult to make friends on there, and you just kind of log in...click a button for a group, and log back out again.   thepiratebay - they've stood the test of time against lawsuits and every other fucking government agency.   Actually, the suggestion here is wearing plate armor on your legs.  That's basically what VPN is.  It's an encrypted shell around your normal traffic which Comcast doesn't see as Netflix traffic.   This goes the same for police "Internal Affairs".  They aren't there to actually make sure the police are following the laws...they are there to make sure the precinct doesn't get sued.   Darude - Sandstorm   Here we go with the false equivalence again.   There are quite a few of us out on the internet that have extensive expertise in image manipulation, etc.  It would be rather easy to spot.  Go look at all of the fake jennifer lawrence nudes, and you'll see the tell-tale signs in all of them.  Lighting differences, compression artifacts, etc.  These are real.   You know, by being celebrities they kind of took it with the job title.  They know damn-well the risks associated.   Conversely, we can use this to get celebrities on-board and talking about the issue and start having encryption put in place and measures become the default so these things are less likely to happen everywhere.   This is exactly why my long term goal in life is to eventually become completely solar/wind powered with an electric vehicle.   Technically, gay marriage in Florida is legal.  By the overturning of a ban on gay marriage: http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/08/21/4301754/federal-judge-florida-gay-marriage.html   They typically only fail ungracefully whenever you try to use whatever said feature required the permission that you've taken away.  So there's that.   Yeah, I'm sorry - but this isn't the worlds first either.  3D Printed bump keys existed easily a year ago.  I don't think I still have the one I made, but it's certainly not a new thing.   [](/chibipinkie) Their shirts remind me of someone...   GFYCAT ftw!   [](/gummy) I much prefer gummy alligators.   Same shit happened to me, I told the fucking woman that when the adults told her to "go play in the street", they were hoping she would die, and it wasn't supposed to be taken literally!   Mind sharing the link to what you bought?  Pretty cheap for working wifi!   Ohhhh, you said working "wireless" - I was thinking wifi automatically (derp).  Yeah, the nRF24L01 is amazingly cheap!

YES PLEASE!   http://i.imgur.com/2XrTU21.gif   What is it currently doing autonomously?   Known more commonly as a portuguese man-o-war.   It's a very **realistic** outlook, and I'm not democrat, republican, or libertarian.  I'm actually registered Pirate Party.  Anyone with 2 brain cells to rub together can realize that this man is nothing more than another politician - no better than the ones we currently have, except his ideas are out into the extreme and political measures from other divisions (federal and state) will keep him accomplishing them.  The fact that you throw out "libertarian" like it's an insult is a testament to your thought process as well.  Party names mean jack-fucking-squat.  You're still in that "us vs them" mindset.  It's not democrats vs republicans vs green party vs libertarian.  It's people vs politicians.  There are a million, million, million ideas out there on how to solve things.  Person A cannot only encompass a defined _set_ of those ideas and then be labeled "democrat" and that's it.  That's not how ANY of this works!  You're looking at a party label, and toeing the line.  A line that doesn't exist, but you somehow perceive.  I somehow believe you wouldn't be supporting this man at all if he was labeled a libertarian or a tea-party republican.   3 my tighty whities.

Otherwise your balls stick to your leg.   swamp-ass.   http://investmentwatchblog.com/comparison-chart-of-the-economic-concepts-employed-by-political-parties/#1Hh63Z3gJEZUl0gp.99  Written by him, it's a bunch of scare tactic bullcrap.  Apparently having Democrats in office, leads to socialism!  Republicans lead to Corporate Socialism!  And Libertarians lead to economic CHAOS!!!  When people use such definitive statements like this, it's pretty obvious that it's a bunch of bullshit.  Then, he uses that article to shill for his website http://www.zerocosteconomy.com/  Where we get things such as:   Located on this page: http://www.zerocosteconomy.com/description.html Every day the costs that we must pay every month increase. Most people are not able to save money and invest for a decent retirement.  Where is the research backing this statement up?  Then the last half of it, is literally a bunch of bullshit "what if" questions, which sound like they're GREAT, but cannot happen simply with a governor taking seat.  Not to mention, it's basic economics that if things are deflationary, which he proposes, that it stagnates the economy and creates reasons for everyone to save, puts everyone out of jobs, etc.  Then, we get other bullshit on this page: http://www.zerocosteconomy.com/problem.html  The biggest and the most immediate threat to the economy of the United States and, for that matter, of the entire world, isn't global warming or the depletion of natural resources, because the direst effects of these phenomena aren't immediately imminent. (**Experts believe** we won't see the full impact of global warming for 50 to 100 years.)  More weasel-words.  Which experts?  Why not link to the studies if said experts believe these things?   Unless this devastating trend is halted and reversed immediately, vigorously, and effectively, our good days will soon be over.  Fear-mongering bullshit.  I mean, there's so much of it I'd have to basically copy-paste his whole fucking website.  He uses the extreme views of zealots in order to try and basically give us a false dichotomy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma) in order to argue a point that he's not even making very well.  There are even _DIRECT_ false dichotomies on that very page:   As Americans, we have two choices: listen to the usual rhetoric and empty promises, or help achieve economic security as explained in Towards a Zero-Cost Economy  Oh, and he wouldn't be a good politician if he didn't mention "THE CHILDREN!"  This is exactly how all politicians scare-monger and push crap through the system.   Making the right choice is no trifling matter. Your own futureand your children'sare at stake.  Oh, and that's right - you wanted to know which statements were lies.  Which statements specifically?  Well, there's even more...how about this juicy crap here:   Our economic and political systems simply can't continue in their current state. No matter how one looks at or interprets the situation, it's clear that costs are the root of our economic woes.  Costs are not the reason for our economic woes.  Bullshit spending is.  You cannot simply "freeze" costs, because businesses will move elsewhere.  And how about this entire page here: http://www.zerocosteconomy.com/economic.html  "Carefreeism"...you're fucking joking me right?  He wants zero-interest financing.  FREE energy.  No taxes on owned homes.  Outlaw of subprime loans.  Everyone gets to retire at 50.  Deflation, our money is worth more!  And then he paints everything else as completely unsustainable.  Except we're not "purebred" socialism.  We're not purebred capitalism.  We have a fine mix of socialistic and capitalistic tendencies.  Painting everything as black and white is just downright bullshit when you get down to it.  And you were talking about Crist 'devolving' into tactics of just attacking one another?  You get this: https://www.facebook.com/fkhavari/posts/721903684526059  YEP!  Charlie Crist TOTALLY didn't appear at the Bartow, FL rally because he was _SCARED_ of Farid Khavari!  I mean, it has nothing to do with the fact that Farid Khavari has only like 5% of the support from voters that Crist has.  And while Crist is Republican (don't even begin to tell me he's not), he actually left the state in pretty good shape when he was governor.  Is he perfect?  Fuck no.  Not by a long shot.  But he has a proven track record, and he was a better governor and Rick Scott.   You're fucking joking, right?  Where are all these Farid Khavari supporters coming out of the woodwork?  This guy is just as bad as the rest of the politicians out there.  "Let's make everyone sustainable by putting solar panels on everyones houses!" -- If you do your research, he stands to gain a lot because he _owns a fucking solar panel company_.  How is this any different than any of the other bullshit every politician has done before him?  His website is full of a bunch of made up statements, lies, and bullshit.  Utopian dreams, spread as gospel and believed as truth by the gullible.   I've done my best trying to get my hackerspace to donate to the cause.  I'll continue posting in the large communities that I frequent!

If it is, throw it up on hackerspaces.org (wiki) as a planned space and link there too.  The community is growing very rapidly, and I'm sure you'll get some hits from there.   No, but from within the USA there are a lot less laws and bullshit politics you've gotta deal with regarding trade agreements which were put in place by companies that reside in the USA for their protection, so suddenly you've got a big inefficient government agency paying lots of workers for a mediocre job of scanning things that cross the border, yadda yadda yadda.  Not only that, but they charge it "because they can"; basically what they believe people will tolerate, etc.  Lots of factors at play.  The USA has a huge advantage in that federal laws are generally that govern interstate commerce, so there's only 1 set of them you've gotta abide by.  It's simple, it's cheap, not a bunch of oversight.  Whereas whenever something goes international, then you've gotta deal with a whole bunch of politics.  Dealing with politics costs money.  I don't know how China manages to get shipping to us so cheaply.  I'd certainly love to know.   The problem is, you're shipping a lot of weight.  You're shipping nearly 3kg (6lbs), and shipping companies charge extra for that.  You really can't blame Taulman, or anyone other than the shipping companies for that.  DeltaMaker got caught up in that too.  We had people slip in international orders for our first tiers at $500, and when we had to tell them shipping such a large, heavy package overseas was going to be $300 through DHL, they actually asked for a refund.  Nevermind $800 was still a _FAN fucking tastic_ deal, it still nearly doubled the price.   https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/projects.html - Just a sample of the different kind of stuff you can do with the Teensy and a modicum of electronics knowledge.

It doesn't.   The pH levels of your water are off, and probably highly chlorinated.  What you're seeing is the result of pitting caused by corrosion of the metal inside the faucet:  http://www.toolbase.org/Building-Systems/Plumbing/copper-pinhole-leaks  If the rest of your piping is copper, you're likely going to start seeing these leaks elsewhere too.  You see this kind of thing in pool systems all the time, especially when pool pump housings aren't built and you get lots of UV reacting with the chlorine in the water pump.   I've also seen this in areas where water is over chlorinated.  Chlorine attacks and corrodes practically any metal, and it's likely that this pinhole formed over time from a pit on the inside of the nozzle.   Really hard to give you an answer without knowing what kind of power supply, what it's rated for, etc......   The top didn't say "getting a haircut".  It said "asking the hairdresser".  You're inferring the haircut and it's getting in the way of the joke.   Taulman has been an awesome member of the community for some time now, releasing some of the first Nylon filaments ever available for printing use.  He's now got 6 more formulations he's trying to raise money for.  Unlike most kickstarters, he's already got a successful business selling Nylon filament.      You went from a state with the "worst morning commutes" to "highest pedestrian fatalities": http://time.com/106155/pedestrian-deaths-traffic/   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Computer_passwords   However, in February 2012 the Eleventh Circuit ruled otherwise - finding that requiring a defendant to produce an encrypted drive's password would violate the Constitution, becoming the first federal circuit court to rule on the issue.[69][70] In April 2013, a District Court magistrate judge in Wisconsin refused to compel a suspect to provide the encryption password to his hard drive after FBI agents had unsuccessfully **spent months trying to decrypt the data.**[71][72]  That's also why you use sentence-based passwords.  The problem is that a lot of people use weak-sauce easily cracked passwords.  http://xkcd.com/936/  So your reply doesn't come off rude, as much as ignorant.  My TrueCrypt containers, for example use a sentence-based password with at least 2 non-dictionary words and AES-256 bit encryption.  The passwords are _very_ easy to remember, and near-impossible to crack without my express knowledge.  And it does keep the ISP from seeing your traffic (SSH is not cleartext traffic).

Invest a little more money in a non-logging VPN (added $3-10 a month) and set your router up to push all traffic through the VPN.  You'll get around all of their logging/throttling, etc.  BTGuard is a good one though you might want to find one with a US server, because a lot of content can be blocked via IP geolocation.  And quite honestly, in this day and age you'll want to learn how to do this.  Even if you have nothing to hide.  Simply because they sell you "the internet", and they're doing their best every damn day to divide the internet up and charge you for "packages".  It's your internet, you should be free to use it however the hell you want.  Furthermore, if you're really paranoid - it's even better to set up your own private VPS and roll your own VPN solution because BTGuard and others _do comply with law enforcement_ whenever asked.  They'll roll over faster than a trained dog.  Whereas if you're rolling your own VPN, you choose exactly what is logged, you can verify it, and you can also encrypt your data, meaning law enforcement cannot get to it due to the 5th amendment.  Encrypt all the things!   Not only the points system, but real-time reporting of traffic events, such as speed traps.  I've _easily_ saved myself $1k in traffic tickets and points thanks to Waze.  It also adds ETA and group tracking (when multiple friends have the same destination, it'll show ETA for everyone)  It's not for everyone.  It would be _way_ too easy to get distracted with a lot of the things you can do with Waze - but it's more than just Google Maps with a point system.    superior Waze  FTFY   Generally just a cylindrical object next to the piece for it to work on while the original part cools that's the same height as the object you're printing.

This can be solid advice in some situations, but it's not always a solid solution.  Primarily because radiant heat from the heater block can hover over finished layers for too long, actually re-softening them and making the problem worse in some circumstances.

I approve of this posting.   Because fuck you, that's why.   One thing I've done that works really well is to cut off the cat's paws. I recommend making the amputation at the metacarpophalangeal joint.  Afterwards, they don't really walk much, it's more of a sideways crawl, so they don't have much incentive to leave your property.  You might also consider fusing wheels onto their stumps so they can still skate around the house. If you have an RV pad you can turn that into a playground for them.

To some extent, yes.  * $500 order is $12.95 shipping * $1,000 order is $19.95 shipping * $2,000 order is $29.95 shipping  Do you think that shipping difference is mostly the increased insurance cost? It seems a bit much to me.   I've never had them take more than 2 business days.  Two business days for what?  To clear a check/ship or ship once the status changes from "on hold" to "confirmed payment"?   I've never had shipping time issues with them, though I don't have a big order history with Monarch.  My biggest gripe with them is their tiered shipping raping structure. I mean pricing structure. The more you buy, the more $ you pay in shipping, yet they use the same priority mail/flat rate box.  In other words, you may pay $20 shipping and get the same flat rate box a $450 order would come in. You've just paid 2x as much for shipping.  Provident has the "worst" shipping times, from my experience.  I always pay by check, so I get hit with the literal week of clearing time for that.  Then, after that clearing week, the order switches to "confirmed payment" where it can take another 2-3 days to actually ship out.  Another thing to note is my last order with them, my check actually posted/cleared my bank the day the check was received at Provident. This is according to tracking delivery date and the post date on my check via online banking.  Same friggin' day Provident receives my check, the $ is taken from my bank. Which, in this day and age, is really how it should be, yet clearing time seems stuck in decades past.      Actually, it does have to go on. But thanks for being naive about how corporate IT works.

[How did I do?](http://i.imgur.com/K55nPo3.png)   Good evening everybody, time for another silver update. Let me draw some lines on this chart by NetDania. Now let's zoom out and check the volume on the smackdown they laid on us at 10am like they always do. Time to read an entire 3rd party article where I **emphasize** particular **words** while I highlight them on screen to hammer my **point** (???) home.  And, we'll talk to you next time.         * It should be silver * It should be "Designed in *your state here*" * It should have commonly used adapters available separately for purchase * You should be able to rationalize the emotional reasons why the device needs regular recharging   I expected a really light colored gray line that our UX team always delivers which I can't even see.      Front-end development.   **A**pply uses an **a**rray to pass the arguments. That's how my pea brain associates/memorized them.   Which is why it's always fun to listen to them.  Did any PM "expert" predict the crash over the past 3-4 years? If the experts have shit track records, there's no point in having experts.  I'd love to know what Mr. Morgan (and others like Mike Maloney) have personally done with silver over the past 3-4 years.   Your buddy needs a collar.   Personally, I can't say I'm seeing inventory issues.  What specific products have you been looking at and through which dealers?   Can't argue with that.   Really? Has he ever said to exit your position, get into cash and wait? When silver was in the 40s? 30s? 20s?   I'm moving everything I have into a new small business - hunter/killer kittens.  FACT: When the collapse comes, just like today, everyone will need to eat.  With one (or five, ask about bulk pricing) of my killer kittens, you'll never have to worry about food.   What do you really want when the SHTF? Some Mercury dimes or a bag full of dead birds and mice?  Think about it.    Inventory is running out among a bunch of different online vendors  What do you base this on?      Correct, but he has to pimp the fact silver is "cheap" and the price of a coin is about the price of what it takes to mine it.  Sounds like a deal!  He doesn't explain what his metrics are, only mentioned First Majestic being around $14, then goes on to say conservatively cost is around $17.      I'd give them a week to respond, i.e., I wouldn't do anything with my credit card company until Thursday.  That's just me, though (and I'm an asshole).   In the 13s if the gold:silver ratio stays relatively the same.   Well, if the strength of the US Dollar continues through 2015-2016 and the Fed actually raises rates, PMs are going to drop.  If this case plays itself out, your pain will be compounded if you buy strictly bullion instead of semi-numismatic.    to pushing to a live server  I thought this is where the QA process starts? What could you do before this?   Wow, that's pretty crazy, I bet they used Angular to do that. I wonder what would happen if they opened an office in Sydney or Beijing.      One of my new/sealed 10 oz RCM bars has a little bit of milk spotting like that. I've never seen it on a JM bar, not that that means anything. Just a bit of nature of the beast, I suppose.   *The Road* is a movie about total collapse of society, scavenging to survive, real "SHTF" mentality that does exists in the PM community. There's a certain amount of cross pollination between stackers and preppers, where you'll hear about SHTF, TEOTWAWKI (Shit Hits The Fan/The End Of The World As We Know It respectively).  A bit nutty, IMO, but to each their own.  Now, back to stacking ammo and downloading the *How to Field Dress Your Neighbor* manual.   Economic crisis and fail of the dollar does not mean gold and silver become the new medium of exchange. It just means the value of the dollar becomes less.  Too many nutters think we're going down *The Road*.   From years of working with freelance front-end developers, I can tell you the answer is freelance front-end developers should be able to produce unmaintainable spaghetti code.   Or people could just buy a phone that fits their hand.

 The thing is... the guy is on TV releasing *why* they aren't indicting Wilson but the people are already going nuts..., why don't people want to know the truth. If you showed up tonight, you we're already decided on the issue.    I apologize for being 4 months late on this but when I saw your message I finally decided to take action!  http://imgur.com/a/vpidO   My last name is Jones.., this makes me uncomfortable.   Nothing.   Taken right at the time that she told your dad she's  pregnant.    This is the coolest thing I've ever seen in my life. *CRIES*   We get it! You have a Porsche, God.... OP is such a freakin show off!   Ya I never negotiate my commission, but I also put about $600-800 into each one of my listings. I guess it just depends on the amount of service you want.    Barack Obama and Betty White.    I'm a realtor in the area. I don't typically do rentals but pm me your name and numbe and we'll find you something. I have a program that lets me set basically any criteria I want, it's all free of charge I'll just give you the list of properties and you can call.   That's all a shame, not sure why this question got down voted but Ive been itching to take a little bit and was thinking about either a free share or back to UO (more for the relationships then for the new style of play) but have also been checking in on SOA every month or so. Considered putting some money into the startup but I just don't see too much I like as of now.    Trees a squarter   You gotta lay the 'D' before the 'D' gets laid on you.    I've looked at PvP videos and it clearly doesn't look anything like Pvp on UO. Just to save the comment, "you know why... it's not UO!" I get that but anybody who has had early access, what is the PvP like? Is this a game I should get behind?   I had around $1,800 in GTAT on Friday, I have about $180 today. I upvoted.   Ah nice well hopefully somebody will purchase GTAT and the stocks I have in right now will be worth something but everything indicates it won't be.   Nice where in VA? I live in Va Beach.   I left work around 1 PM. My gf works for the local news so she doesn't go in until 3. Immediately came in and just went to pound town. She left. I made some bacon. Laid in bed most the day with the itis. Met some clients at 6:00, came home around 7:15, got in some sweats, cooked some more bacon, now I'm awaiting the football game.   Well as a new person involved in stocks I learned a valuable lesson today. Luckily considering I'm new and rather young I only had about $2,000 in stocks, I said luckily because I'm reading on message boards of people losing 80-150k. I guess I just sit on my stocks and hope some way in hell I get something out of it? *sighs* A big lesson in life today.   Xbox one   Wish y'all the best of luck! I've always wished I could make my own shard but .. stupid life always in the way   I agree about the watch. Do I think it was overhyped? Absolutely but I do think we'll eventually stabilize around $15-16 and by then I'm hoping the rumor mill will pick up again with the iPhone 6S. The news now? A lot of speculating is going on but the two big ones; the original quarter reports we're correct and the profits they showed won't be altered with the absence of the iPhone, there is some sort of partnership with the upcoming Tesla announcement. (I don't really see this one but just saying what I've been seeing)   I was raised on Va Beach near Virginia Beach Blvd. we used to have trucks come through in the summer atleast once a month but I love on Shore Drive now and I never see them.    I was with you until I saw Xbox 360... :(   Well this just happened.. Not in high school anymore but I'm impressed: http://abc7chicago.com/news/2-female-teachers-arrested-over-threesome-with-student/333793/   Been dropping, dropping dropping, and I've been buying it up every dollar or so but it just sky rocketed back up to around $11.20, what in the hell is going on?   Are we guaranteed good news next week?   That's so awesome you haven't had any complications. Prayers for you from Virginia!   I was just thinking of a realistic standpoint. The game isn't worth $14 month but they have to earn money. If they did it similar to transfer tokens etc. it would be interesting. Atleast bring more life to the game. I think they couldn't exploit UO as EA enjoys to do because they would be competing against 3rd party resource and skill trainer services. Just my 2 cents, didn't expect to be down voted back to Deceit dungeon.    I think everybody has a tough time deciding a "perfect era" but I think a pre-trammel period of any sort would peak a lot of interest.   As easy as it is for skill gain, I think UO should consider free to play model now. The game is so dated, add skills like $25-50 to 120 a skill etc.   This way people could jump in rather easily. I know I would have an account to at least BS on and log on occasionally to see what's going on. They might not make a ton of money off me but that would at least be one more person logging in that hasn't for years now.    OR HE ATE IT!!! EWWWWW   	31

    I had brussel sprouts and rice.. :(      Post this on /r/nosleep, they'll know.   I'd beat them to death with my paperback Lord of the Flies book. If that doesn't work I have 20 pound textbooks I can chuck at them!   Thanks for the different perspective! I agree with you and I've heard from a lot of other people too that academics aren't the most important thing and that experience is more essential. At the moment, I don't know what I want to do. My parents want me to go into business but I'm still not really sure yet.    Thanks for your suggestions! I know I can't get into an Ivy League with just academics and that extracurriculars are also necessary. However, I'm not really aiming that high. Thats just what my parents want and so far what I've learned is it's fine if I don't end up in any Ivy League schools. There are plenty of good colleges out there still. I'll try to talk to my mom again when she cools off but thank you for your suggestions. I feel a lot calmer right now than when I typed the previous posts.   Yeah, it's true that I took the wrong approach. I shouldn't have commented about her socializing but if I talked about my anger and depression she wouldn't think much of it. I've tried before early on in high school and in middle school when things weren't as bad but she wouldn't listen. Honestly, she won't change because thats just the type of person she is. Also, I care about my future immensly. It's my own god damn life, not her's, of course I would care! Sure as a parent you're supposed to care about your children but there's a line between concern and abuse. She's too concerned about me doing well in school that she's neglecting me from other opportunities in life such as making new friends, going outside, participating in different school events, etc. I apologize if I sounded a bit harsh or extreme but at this point I'm more angry than I am depressed.    Yeah, I've been on that subreddit before. It's pretty terrible to see the things a lot of Asian kids experience and it honestly makes me hate Asian culture more. I can tell you firsthand that most Asian parents see their children as investments or stocks for their own future success. They want their kids to do well so they can brag to other people about their child's success. The other aspect I hate is the constant competitiveness. Because nearly all Asians kids are under constant pressure from their parents, they're practically being thrown into a pit to compete with each other, not for survival, but for better grades. Those who don't do as well as the other kids are disgraced and tossed aside as if they're a shame to the whole Asian culture. It's disgusting and I wish they would acknowledge that every child has their own strengths and weaknesses. Just because someone didn't get into an Ivy League School, score better on the SATs, or get a 5 on AP tests doesn't make them any less of a person. Sorry if what I said sounded extremely racist. I'm not saying it because I want to sound like a bitch, I'm saying it because it's true and I'm sure there are several other Asian kids out there who feel the same; they're just too afraid to express their opinions or speak out to their parents because of the consequences.   Normally I wouldn't have said anything at all. I was just fed up with her hypocritical bullshit. My mom talks to her old classmates on her phone all the time and socializes with them pretty much every hour of the day when shes not sleeping. So I said that she was a hypocrite for telling me to stay at home and work while not socializing with my classmates or friends to which she replied you're 16 you're supposed to be focusing on your schoolwork and not to be engaged in idle chit chat with your friends. That just pissed me off further and the argument blew up even more from there. I mostly just argued about my current situation and how restrictive she is. Since our argument just ended 3 hours ago, she's still upset but honestly I don't really care about how she feels right now.   Jesus dude how much thought have you given into this?   In elementary school some kid stole all 5 of my Exodia cards from Yu-Gi-Oh :(   I'm 16, a teenager in my junior year of high school, and I'm confused and stressed out like everybody else around my age. However, recently I've been having an especially hard time controlling my anger and depression.   Up until middle school, I was leading a simple and carefree life. Everyday I would go outside, play with neighbors, and pretty much be the usual innocent 3rd grader. Then starting in 6th grade, my parents became like your stereotypical Asian parents: strict, abusive at times, and for a lack of a better word, unrealistic. Naturally, because of their demands, I started working harder, goofing off less, and unfortunately I also slowly stopped hanging out with my friends. At this point in my life, I obviously wasn't as happy as I once was, but I began to deal with it and "suck it up" but most importantly I wanted to succeed in order to make my parents proud of me. I thought that maybe if I was able to meet their expectations, they might let me go out and play with friends. I couldn't be more wrong. As years began to whiz past, I realized that there will be no end to their ridiculous expectations. As a child my parents wanted me to get to Honors classes when I was in middle school. I was able to achieve it after some hard work. It felt as if I barely had a second to congratulate myself before they gave me a new task: get into AP classes. This took a lot more work but I was able to achieve that too. Again, I was proud and felt accomplished more than ever, when they gave me a new task, or 3... : Get at least a 2300 on your SATs, get a 5 on your AP exams, and get into an Ivy League school. Now here I am, more confused, more lost, and more stressed than ever.   It feels that my social life has also been dwindling too. I once had several friends and now I barely have 3 classmates that I'm not even sure if they're my friends or not. To combat my loneliness, I resorted to playing online video games when my parents aren't home. It was the only way I was able to enjoy myself and pretend that I do actually have friends. However, a few weeks ago they found out and since then they've been monitoring my internet usage, making sure that I don't play and I work hard to prepare for my upcoming tests. In fact the only reason I'm allowed on Reddit is because I convinced them that Reddit is like Wikipedia, a database with a lot of information.   Aside from the loneliness and depression I've been experiencing, I always constantly feel angry and irritable. Every small thing always appears to anger me for no reason. Just a few hours ago, I decided to confront my Mom about how shes treating me and instead of being submissive like I usually was, I decided to actually talk back. It didn't end well. This only lead to more screaming and more anger. Nothing was resolved. To end this off, I'm currently on my spring break, only one day left before school starts again and I still have a ton of work to do. Nowadays, I get angry and jealous at my classmates who are able to enjoy and experience a social life that I haven't enjoyed since elementary school. I know this is common in Asian culture but sometimes I wish I wasn't born as an Asian...    [denki anma](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=denki+anma).    I also have a group of real life friends I play games with online. The problem is my parents don't let me play video games so I have to play when they're not home. Finding time to game is especially frustrating for me and it sucks when your parents catch you.

If they drop any lvl 110 weapons or necro weapons, extract them and hopefully you'll get a bunch of superior item crystals which you can sell in fm for about 250k each.   It's by no means cowardly. There is no possible way for you to experience the pain other people feel, whether it's emotional, mental, or physical. If the person genuinely wants to end their life and see no way around it, let them do it. It's not cowardly for someone to end the pain and suffering they've gone through. After all, it's a natural human instinct to avoid pain.    I agree with you suicide is tragic and it places a mental, emotional, and perhaps physical burden on their loved ones; however, suicide is not selfish. Those who have committed suicide did it to end their own pain and suffering because they couldn't tolerate it anymore. It's almost the same concept as Euthanasia. If someone wants to genuinely end their life and see no way around it, just let the person do it. By keeping them alive, you're the one being inconsiderate and selfish to their wishes.   Suicide is a very tragic issue; however, if they person genuinely wants to end their life and see no other way from the pain they're experiencing, then let them end it. It sucks to see people insult those who committed suicide as "inconsiderate" because they left their loved ones to deal with the pain of losing them. Sure, suicide places a burden on everyone but wouldn't it be inconsiderate to call those who committed suicide inconsiderate? At the end of the day, you never know what someone else is going through so you shouldn't be the one to judge.    Oh ok thank you! I was watching episode 1 at 1:30 am last night so I kinda missed some details.    I hope so! I'm really looking forward to watching this whole series. I think I remember seeing it on Cartoon Network or Adult Swim when I was a kid but I don't really remember much of it anymore.   Oh one more question. If Renton's father was a hero why were his classmates making fun of him?   Thank you so much for the answers!!   I just started watching Eureka Seven, so far it seems like a pretty solid show however Im a bit lost. I have a few questions:  1. Are the Gekkostate and LFO the same group?  2. I read online that Gekkostate or the LFO are a group of mercenaries so aren't they part of the military?  3. Why did the military attack the Nirvash robot at the of the first episode?  Sorry if any of these questions are stupid. I just need some clarifications before I continue this series. Thanks again! I'm really liking Eureka Seven so far.    Myself   I'd like to die in my sleep at peace and knowing I've lived my life with no regrets.   Haha no problem dude! You should try out some of One Republic's other songs. They usually have life lessons and deep meanings along with a catchy melody. They're one of my favorite bands!   I have no idea   What I am writing about  Refrigerator   I agree completely! Your comment reminds of the One Republic song "I Lived"   I'm currently going through some rough and stressful times. Speaking truthfully, the only thing that keeps me going is knowing that life will get better eventually. I don't know when or how it will happen but what I do know is that if I do give up on life, I'll be missing out on the great opportunities in the future.     RIP in peace buttholes  FTFY: Ripperoni in Pepperoni's buttholes   Back in middle school, people used to trade Silly Bands and wear them everywhere, showing them off like they were gold necklaces.   The good ol' days of Maplestory in 2006, grinding and talking to people at Pig Beach or Henesys Hunting Ground. :)   There are benefits and disadvantages in every stage in life. It's impossible to control that, but what you can control is your perspective. Focus more on the advantages you'll gain when you enter the work force (ex: more freedom, getting married, earning your own money) rather than dwelling on the negatives. Good luck dude!    I wouldn't. Immortality isn't a blessing. I doubt anyone would want to live forever and see their friends, family, pets, and the whole world die before them. Also, killing someone and taking their remaining years is pretty much stealing life from them which is really fucked up.    Kristen Stewart for Twilight.   All asians know Wei-Chuan is the best chinese frozen food brand!   Lol yes   What a dick! I would hate your stepfather if he'd done that to me!

 Michael Laws.   Report this man.   Oscar Issac was fantastic in Sucker Punch - especially in the Extended Cut. His final scene features him trying to molest a lobotomised girl and not being satisfied because she isn't fighting back. His reaction is so fucking chilling.   You mean domestic poster. The international poster doesn't say May 1st because it comes out earlier.   Read each of them once ;)   It's *Mama, I just killed a man* not      **MAMA**: *I just killed a man*.   The Catcher in the Rye. Basically, it's a book about trying as hard as you can to avoid seeing yourself as you really are.    You mean since 2012, considering Thor takes place immediately after IM2 and Cap 1 takes place in the 40s.   They were with Fallon on Late Night too.   Fun fact: Lindelof and Cuse pitched for a fifth season end date, but ABC made them stretch it out to six.   So, you're 32. Why are you wasting your own time with such a redundant comment at your age?    I guess IDNRC. Sorry :)   That still doesn't explain why I'm just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply Hefty bag to hold my-y-y-y-y-y-y love.   [Mate!](http://youtu.be/Vjn2JKrlkcU)   Thor-y of Ev...that's a terrible title, Empire.   Die Antwoord were comedians before they were musicians IIRC. They're characters, so I have no doubt it's another case of the fake Michael Cera difficulty stories surrounding AD Season 4.   Don't you mean she's....**Taken**?!   Plus not tagged as ALTERED.   Michael Emerson or Terry O'Quinn.   They could have thought of some more intriguing trailer dialogue than "This is awesome!" and "Sweet!" It will sound more realistic in the movie, but come on. Don't put people saying that in the trailer. It's obnoxious and a turn-off.   She doesn't write at all. She's a director.   That's perfect, justified opinion. Pretty rare in these discussions.   I was asking because I'm a diehard fan and I wanted someone to back up their ridiculous hyperbole with anything other than vague statements. These aren't examples. I know every episode inside and out. I grew up with this show, and can answer any of the "unanswered" questions people usually bring up. Could you try again with any more than the same old BS I'm so sick to death of?   S3 and S5 finales would be fantastic *cancelled show finales* and the Internet would have elevated Lost to Firefly levels of worship, plus it would have saved us from the internet hive-mind circlejerk over the series finale (which I personally loved, and thought redeemed a mostly average final season).   I ended up checking it out and *Why was there a polar bear?* and *what was that monster and is it a dinosaur?* are probably worse than people thinking they were dead the whole time.      Go see Kingsman: The Secret Service in theatres. You'd probably love it.   Could you give examples as to why there's no substance?   The thread right next to this is called "What TV show was a complete waste of time?"     I'm afraid to go in there.   ...or they could have divided 1000 by 50 (=20) and estimated from there.   [Search and Destroy](http://youtu.be/EDNzQ3CXspU), of course.   Season 6 makes it pretty clear that they're choosing to tell a myth/legend, and they even go through the light/water semi-explanation of why the island moves, and how they explain MIB's camp building the donkey wheel to change the direction of the water/light mechanism.     Plus you've got the constant hints to Egyptian mythology, and the fact that people teleport to Tunisia specifically, which is relatively close to Egypt, tells you that this is likely the original location of the Island's land mass before it was dislodged from space through whatever the hell kind of mythical Egyptian hogwash makes it work.      What exactly happened for no logical (storytelling) reason? Everything happens to move the story along or build atmosphere. It may not be the most scientifically logical, but by the Season 5 finale they make it pretty damn clear it isn't supposed to be that type of story.   The title track from Kid A may well be the most emotionally draining song I've ever heard - it worms it's way into my head and leaves me depressed for the rest of the day after I listen to it.     The album never made me shiver like Exit Music, or the payoff of Electioneering after Fitter Happier. It just left me shrugging and in a gloomy mood. The National Anthem, Optimistic, and Disappear will stay with me, but Everything, In Limbo and Idioteque became repetitive after several listens.     The appeal of that album is something that can't be explained. I think it's just something that only certain people can *get*. I won't be one of them.     But, The King of Limbs? Whaaaaa...   The execution of the guy with the rat in *The Green Mile*   Flux capacitor, the force, totally grounded in reality.    JJ Abrams left after one episode to make M:I3 and never came back. He has basically nothing to do with the show.   ITT: Premieres, not pilots.   What do you mean? This is when such riveting drama occurs as Sun losing her wedding ring, Michael ditching to go yell *WAAAAALLT*, Shannon being mad about not being taken seriously etc. These are such defining moments in the series /s   It's definitely not.   Best one I can think of is Stand By Me, and another great one where the first act is entirely about this: The Deer Hunter. Three hours long, so the first act is quite long.   The Governor says Liar as he kills Hershel. I was quoting the scene.   Alternatively:     *She's not my daughter. I stole her as a baby from an insane woman. She means nothing to me. I'm not coming out of this house, so if you want to kill her, go ahead a-*   *Liar.*   Yeaaaaaah...Mary from Jasper, Alabama...   Didn't affect me because I'd seen the whole series, but the US S2 blu-ray begins with a full season 4 trailer, beginning with the line "We're really going home!". I had to import the blu-ray because it's not available anymore in NZ.   His monologue in the Season 5 finale is the best! And in episode 6.07. I like both Evil Ben and Conflicted Ben just as much as each other.   Game of Thrones would be so much better if they were the same ages as in the books.   Fun fact: The only episode after that to end with a non-Giacchino music montage is 2.19: S.O.S. 25/26 episodes later.     Alternatively, [here's my personal favourite LOST ending](http://youtu.be/YdPwvglZSP8). From 3.08: *Flashes Before Your Eyes*. **MASSIVE SPOILERS**   They've seen it loeds.   And about the reaper storyline. These are apocalypse games, so they should be apocalypse movies. ME has rich lore and great history, but the reason I love these games is because of the characters and the Normandy crew. I want to see Sovereign and Harbinger on a massive screen!           EDIT: I mean compared to creating an original story in this universe, which is what is always suggested in these kinds of threads.   Peacewalker came out after 4, so I'm planning on playing it after 4 and before Ground Zeroes. Am I doing it right?   It's not just on Conan's videos. The comments are botted to get hundreds of fake likes. The likes aren't real, most of the comments aren't real. Don't believe that stuff :)   'UGC Expert' on inFamous 2. Because of this, I deleted all of my save data and spent two hours one morning, close to 10 months after I gave up, marathoning 25 straight user-generated missions as soon as I unlocked them again.     Trophies take so long to pop in the first two inFamous games that if you turn your console off 10 seconds into what could be a 30 second wait, it cancels the trophy. Pretty bad.   How to best structure a Mass Effect movie. I highly disagree that it should be an original story in that universe. Mass Effect are apocalypse games, so they should be apocalypse movies.          I also think Shepard should die on Virmire.   Or New Zealand for a couple of hours earlier.   No, that was just the name of the episode.   Just like when they confirmed The Division for 2014.   I'm calling it: Bruce or Alfred becomes the Joker.   Just got back from seeing it, and that scene seems more inspired by The Raid 1.   Have you been reading YouTube comments lately? I've seen this "news" too. It's a scam.   I watched the first 30 or so minutes on YouTube and the whole thing was a bit drab for the week I was having, so I stopped.      Eddie Redmayne played a good southerner, though.   The awkwardly straightforward direction, the overuse of Halle Berry, the early brutal killing of a main character for contractual reasons, the difference in pacing from the other movies, the tone shift from gritty and restrained to lighthearted and super cheesy were enough reason for me to actively dislike it for basically the entire runtime. I'm not even a comic book reader; it was a terrible sequel from beginning to end. Whenever Jean does anything tragic, it's too silly to take seriously. Calling it "The Last Stand" and hinting towards undoing both Magneto being cured and Xavier being killed - what was the point of that?   Because they both had one fight scene each...   I definitely don't *love* Whiplash, but I *really like* it enough to pester casual moviegoers I know IRL to watch it.           It seems like the kind of film that would get someone more into film. That's what Shawshank was for me, and I'd bet money that Whiplash will be that movie for many people. It's accessible for the general public, but just artsy enough to convince some people that they're missing out.   After bi-yearly releases for the first three books, people had to wait 11 years to hear the rest of Tyrion's (etc.) story. While of course George isn't getting any younger, neither are the fans. There are probably many fans who died waiting. A Storm of Swords was 1100+ pages long, and it took two years to write. I'm not saying that it justifies people getting angry, but apologisers should acknowledge it's a massive annoyance.   Don't listen to Jay and Jack's rewatches, though. They're on their second rewatch and both sets spoil absolutely everything.      Just saying.   He never edited himself out of DT. He edited the first book a lot, but only the first.   You're right. He's like Beth from Walking Dead - 29 year old actress playing 19, but you'd never notice. It's still uncomfortable for those who know.   Tobey - 39      Andrew Garfield - 31     They're both pretty fucking old. Keep them the hell out, is my advice to Marvel/Sony.   Holy shit, Jude Law would have been great in The Prestige.   Agents of SHIELD did that with Lucy Lawless in the S2 premiere.   The movie was manipulative enough. Turing was a revolutionary, and no one deserves what the UK government did to him...but the movie tries too hard to turn him into an underdog with a social disorder, which from what I've read, is bullshit through and through.   Those last few episodes of Season 3, though. The big moment in The Brig (3.19) where Cooper says "...Tom Sawyer." That's one of the moments I'd like to rewatch with no memory. It's hardly ever mentioned, but I say it's one of the best episodes of the series; and that revelation is insanely good.      You ever been to Jasper?   /r/quityourbullshit is all about shaming people for lying on the Internet; and the comments for every post is a ton of "what pathetic fucking losers these people are amirite?" It's embarrassing when much of the time, people don't notice that the *evidence* clearly doesn't contradict the "bullshitter's" claim, but the post still gets really popular. Also, when someone's post is a permalink to another Reddit comment, it usually leads to thousands of negative karma points for the "bullshitter", whether they deserve it or not. It's pretty bad.    Trust me, I wouldn't praise the film if I didn't watch the legit cut. It's more like I don't really care to see the original, and this might spark my interest. I know how it ends, too, so that doesn't bother me.   Fan, I gather?   I think this will be my first viewing of Man of Steel. Hearing about how bloated it feels is exactly why I've never bothered. This sounds way more appealing. I'll look for it when it's posted to FanEdit.org   That was for a scene in the S1 finale, which was ensemble-centric.   Even more:      *TVLINE | Do you know why the decision was made to kill her now? Honestly, I feel like its story-driven. It does propel the story forward The [second half of Season 3] was a bit of a free-for-all. It had an organic fluidity to it and it just naturally unfolded day-by-day, week-by-week, moment-to-moment.*      I don't think an actress over 40 would want to walk out on a consistent role in one of the most popular TV shows in the world.      Many of them walked out because of a loyalty to Darabont, but she needed the role more than they did. Bernthal had been cast in a Scorsese movie.   You're making assumptions based on nothing.     TVLINE | How long have you known about Andreas death?      Laurie Holden: I didnt get the official word until a few days before we began [shooting] the finale. It was a shock to everyone. It was never part of the original story docs for Season 3. And it was rather unexpected. That said, this is The Walking Dead. This show is not conventional by any means  and we know that as actors going in. So you roll with it. You show up, you do the best job you can, and you honor the storytelling. Overall, this has been an extraordinary experience and I just feel so blessed to have been a part of it.   My number 5 as well!   (In DNA, if you press the action button while seeing how many *total* feathers you've collected, it tells you how many you've found out of how many there are in each district of any city. I didn't realise until I'd nearly finished).   Walking Dead Season 3. The season is spent building up to a confrontation, and it all just fizzles out. A character whose writing was heavily criticised was killed off simply because she was unpopular.      But...for some reason we're supposed to care that she dies? The whole reason she's being done off with is because she's unpopular, *so why would killing her off and ending the season on that note* seem impactful for anyone?              **EDIT**: [for anyone who thinks I'm making assumptions](http://tvline.com/2013/03/31/the-walking-dead-andrea-dies-laurie-holden-interview-season-3/)   That's a great way of looking at it. My initial reaction was basically "...that's what this was all building up to?"   The storytelling was great up to a point. Just...if you haven't yet, please refrain from watching the final cutscene of the Origins Easter egg mission. It's insulting.   ...and it's Romeo from Home and Away.   First time the studio logo is shown after the movie begins, which has only been done in IM3 and Guardians.   Who else knew him as Romeo from Home and Away?   Beyond doubt!   The *Once Were Warriors* sequel, if anyone was wondering.    Or *in* NZ since at least 2008.   No young Meryl Streep, and missing almost all of Keira Knightley's best. The wealth of Witherspoon and Cotillard content got my hopes up!   One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest. McMurphy is supposed to be a ginger, but I kept seeing Jack Nicholson.   The LEGO Movie. Seeing the look on Will Ferrell's face when his son tells him about the adventure he's created with his father's LEGO collection. It's heartbreaking.   For me, it was when Percy tells the hick dude the truth about the mouse. When he reaches for the sponge and you see it's bone dry, my sobbing and quiets "no"s turned into a furious cry of "you're a sick fucking asshole!"     Stephen King's drama is better than his horror IMO.    Crash Twinsanity.      It's like Jak and Daxter, but with Crash Bandicoot! Great game to finish in an insanely short amount of time.   But we do know the ratings. Not enough viewers watched either show to justify selling ad space. That's why they were cancelled. You don't enjoy Fallon, and that's fine. He's popular and attracts viewers, so he's staying on the show. It's safe, so why change anything? It's the right decision to avoid backlash upon changing the host after only one year.   They cancelled shows that had bad ratings. What does this prove?   I disagree, but everyone has an opinion.   Michael Emerson is now one of the leads in Person of Interest, which is pretty popular.   I totally understand. As someone who loves Lost deeply, I've got to say I really disagree with anyone who says the pilot is one of the greatest episodes of TV ever.      That first two-part episode is really not that good on rewatch. It's a show that improves *a lot* as it goes on, in pacing and general quality, and peaks in the final stretch of Season 3. Sawyer's accent wavers between scenes as he was still under the impression he was supposed to be from Buffalo. The final moment where everyone stands around in shock for twenty seconds, *blatantly explaining what they just discovered in case the viewer is braindead*, capping off with the dreadful line "Guys...where are we?" - this entire scene makes me want to die, knowing that anyone I recommend this show to will have to sit through this.     Very unpopular opinion, but it's the truth. Since GoT, BrBa and many other high quality dramas have come along, that first two-part episode has aged horribly. Thank God the majority of the series, while it gets pretty fucking ludicrous towards the end (I love it, but it's understandable why some would hate what the show becomes), it maintains incredible production value, stellar direction and a badass score.   True. It's not like he's portrayed as much of a calculated character. He's an impulsive teenager.  	102

Borrow the keys and go to to Taco Bell, Doritos Locos friend.    I often have dreams in which I cannot tell whether they happened or were dreamed. Usually these dreams were preceded by a night of drinking, albeit sometimes not much drinking, but drinking none the less.

Then keep a separate journal for when you wake up to report your Dreams/false memories and compare the two. Good luck, I hope it's nothing serious.   Ha ha ha, A horse mask.... Your moms hot!

It does have *Scarface*. *Scarface* received a bit of scorn on release from the critics including being nominated for a razzie award. This was mainly due to the fact that it was a remake. But, it was the kind of movie that grew on you after watching it. The epic ending alone makes anyone watch the whole movie again. *[Sigh, here I am watching the ending again.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_z4IuxAqpE)*   Let's talk about the story now. It is about a Cuban Immigrant (Al Pacino) trying to live the American Dream. That's it. This story paired with *Al Pacino going ham* and Giorgio Moroder's  synth fueled soundtrack adds to the awesomeness of this classic.        Did you like his performance in Robocop ?

Although Chappie has received quite a fair amount of backlash, Blomkamp has yet to make a movie on the *Shyamalan* level i.e. on the level of The Village or After Earth.   I hope Blomkamp goes all out on the alien movie and does his best. He has shown his brilliance in District 9 which is proof he can make groundbreaking films. If the next Alien movie doesn't meet the expectations. Then ... well ... he may become like the present day ridley scott maybe ??      Terry, who did her own stunts, almost lost her life during the filming of The Wizard of Oz when one of the Winkie guards accidentally stepped on her, breaking her foot.

Terry's salary, $125 per week, was more than that of many human actors in the film, and also more than many working Americans at the time.   Terry died at age 11 in Hollywood on September 1, 1945, and was buried at Spitz's ranch in Studio City, Los Angeles.

Don't you people miss this documentary, keeps you on the edge of the seat until the very end.    Although Al Pacino and Sean Penn have not starred in good films in the recent years, they did some landmark hollywood films in their prime. Al Pacino has The Godfather Trilogy, Scarface, Carlito's Way, Serpico, Heat and many other great movies. Sean Penn is a bit of an inferior actor compared to Al Pacino. But, has directed some great movies and also has starred in classics like Mystic River, Carlito's Way.   Well, Bruce Willis on the other hand is a bit of a wild card. He can really shine in movies with good directors. But, seems to be having a tough time finding a good role in the recent years.   # DiNolan2016   Quintin Taranteninolan movies should have more samurai swords in them.     Nightcrawler, Jodorowsky's Dune, Whiplash, Secret life of Walter Mitty, Boyhood, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Snowpiercer, Nebraska, Why Don't You Play in Hell, John Wick    A tough choice between Daniel Day Lewis and Joaquin Phoenix.   Why does Kubrick keep copying Nolan's style and grittiness ??? Our savior needs to protect his underrated gems with copyright.   That makes her a terrible person too right ??

 I seriously thought it said Barbies.   Say it ain't so!    I would love to have one. I am a cheap little lame-o.   Playing the glitchy ass campaign. I just wanted to know if there was a way around this.   So i finished Halo C.E. on heroic past week and it did not unlock the nameplates, avatar, or anything else really. Anyone else having this issue and/or know how to solve it?  Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this.   During the Halo C.E. Campaign there are Random explosions and parts of the missions do not load. Sometimes you randomly die when no enemies are present at all. Kinda annoying.    Which actually upsets me, since the movie seems like a completely different story; misguiding new fans that developed primarily from the film    I just realized that lisa was not even in the movie, even though she was somewhat of an important character in the G. Novels.   It's a shame that they almost broke up. Lost two members. Good news though, cams still in the band. Can't wait for their next release. My favorite band at the moment.   That user name tho   Waking up each day is one of my worst fears. I'm completely disappointed whenever i open my eyes each morning. I want to die, but i'm too much of a little bitch to kill myself. I'm only alive because i don't want to disappoint the people that i know. Every time i try to kill myself i fail. I always feel like i'm a failure. I can't even take my own life, and i know it's pointless to try anymore. Hurting myself is only a way to feel something other than this depression. Starving, cutting, and depriving myself of sleep are the only ways i can hurt myself. I am scared to sleep, due to the fact that i constantly have nightmares about my life.   I can help but just fell worthless/useless, like i have no reason to stay here. I don't even understand why i'm here. I have no motivation towards life or any activities that use to bring me joy in the past. The joys i felt within these activities were so artificial that it just sickens me to try to participate in any of them. I just don't understand why i am even alive. Everyday is a struggle to try and not end up dead. If i could die without disappointing everyone around me i'd be able to die peacefully. I deserve to die a very painful death. The hatred that i have for myself is sometime unbearable. I just want to slam my head against a wall until i can no longer think, or just jump out into busy traffic. Just something that will be painful. It sounds weird i guess, but a painful death is what i feel I deserve. I have basically no hope in my future and believe that i am heading nowhere in my life.   My life is a disgrace and i can never change. I make up all sort of excuses or outcomes to everything so i can just stay home and waste away. I do not want to be put on any medication because if i do achieve happiness, i do not want it to be artificial from a pill. I've lived most my life around people doing drugs (Brother addicted to pills and many deaths within close friends). I know it's probably my best route but i just cant live with myself that way. But that's suggesting that living like this is any better. I have been getting out a bit more which is a little nice, but i just feel so fake. I want to express this to the people around me, i guess for help. Even with all the things i said in this post, i want to live a happy life. A life where i can say that i atleast feel okay, respect myself, and overall don't shut out the people i love and my friends. i fell as uif i'm losing myself and them. i'm just drifting away, and i cant find a way back. I'm just so paranoid of everything and everyone. This is the first time i've let this out in about 3 months. I just let it build up in myself until i can't take it.  I know that this is just a huge mess of a post, but i just needed to let it out. There is stuff i most likely missed but i'm just overwhelmed by everything. I'm sorry for my bitching and everything. i just can't explain it well. I hope that i do not wake up tomorrow morning. That way i can be happy, and it would be better that way.    Yea, I heard great things about them. I just don't have time to check them out. Do they have a similar sound as sorority noise?    They are probably my favorite band at the moment. I was browsing bandcamp, found them, and fell in love with their sound. I can't wait for their next album. Cam is an amazing musician. I believe he is also in old gray (I think that's what it is called) and need to check that out.   I love sorority noise to death. They are so amazing. If you haven't checked out their album "Forgettable", definitely do so.   Faceless Fear  Broken Promises  Without you  Creations  Faded  We Remember   I don't know, I just though of these. Maybe one may appeal to you.   Oh, well I guess I wasn't paying attention when they said that. Sorry   I wanted to know if anyone would be interested doing a big team battle, CTF, etc.. custom games. Just on the normal maps with normal game modes. Maybe get a whole lobby of people. Possibly even play different custom game modes. I haven't played in a while and just want to play custom games.   Things to do/ lets play in GTA 5  -Washing Machine  Everyone gets into the back of the moving truck (the truck that the achievement hunter crew is inside during carducken) and close the back, someone takes it as high as possible with a cargobob, then they drop it above an ocean and watch them roll around inside of it. Most like they will die inside so it can be last alive. I know its very similar to carducken, but I still think it may be good enough for a separate thing  Not to sure if idea has been pitched already but I thought it would he fun. Most likely not enough for a lets play but still possible if tweaked somehow.      I love it   Those are great   Nice sound   Sick man, dude I wanna see the video.  Update me man.   I know no good spots in Pittsburgh. I basically just try to find some nice lots in etna and millvale. Its kinda horrible since mr smalls was shut down.   Not a huge fan of the vocals.    BEARS   Thank you very much for clarifying that for me. Have a good day!   Wait, can you use that ability with tokens?   	28
 Chasing Life.  Super cheesy ABC Family show, but it's actually pretty good. I've been marathonning the first season all day and was excited to hear there's a second one premiering in a couple months.   A shorter list would be what movies DON'T make me cry.  Most recently it was The Imitation Game. I think the movie that has made me cry the longest and hardest is The Cove.   I also cry every time I watch Sleepless in the Seattle when Tom Hanks says "we'd better go" and Meg Ryan is like "aw man, he isn't into me" and then he says "shall we?" and holds out his hand.   I think she's more like an assistant to Nick Fury, which explains why she's there.   Every time she speaks, though, I cringe.    Because the poster and the trailer made it out to be your typical romcom.  It was a really great movie though, so well written and acted.    I wouldn't call it absolutely horrible, but I much prefer No Country for Old Men the movie vs. the book by Cormac McCarthy.   Michael Moore seems like kind of a dbag in real life, but his movies always reel me in.  Sicko and Bowling for Columbine stick out as the best ones for me.    The Mist   Agreed. I still remember feeling just complete and utter shock. I stared at the screen with my jaw dropped well into the credits.   I don't think anything could ever top that one.   The Family Stone.    This is one of only a few trailers I go back every few months and watch like four times. I still have that version of Creep and listen to it all the time.   And I still remember experiencing the trailer in the theater for the first time. The theater was at capacity but also quiet and it seemed like everyone collectively sighed when it was over.   There's Something Wrong With Aunt Diane   So I'm the assistant manager in a tier 4 store. I guess this also means I am the sales manager? Fine.  This is how my day is supposed to go...  Check in with GM. Check numbers (kiosk, ESP, tech, digital receipts, rewards pen, solution builder, daily sales, VIBE, market basket, ink attachment, paper attachment, paper to ink attachment), meet with all associates about all of these numbers, attempt to improve them 10 fold, work all the freight by myself with a little help from whatever associate is there (not many because there are only 7 in the whole store), shoot pull lists for the entire store, work them until they are completely finished, file them, provide platinum customer service, sell the shit out of everything even though we have nothing, shadow cashiers to make sure they aren't fucking up digital receipts, tell cashiers what part of the signature experience they weren't following, hold rally meetings to discuss goals and how we aren't even close to meeting them, make the store look amazing, do banking, settle tills, check the updated numbers, email all the numbers, babysit closing cashier to make sure they did something other than stand around, walk store, clock out, lock doors, go home, stress out about numbers and how I'm probably going to lose my job because my store can't sell ESP or tech for shit, toss and turn for a while, eventually fall asleep.  Do all of this and cover copy center breaks and lunches and possibly even cashiers' breaks and lunches, depending on the day. And intake computers because I only have one tech.   Wake up and do it all over again.  Just... I don't really know what to do. It's too much. My head is going to explode from all the pointlessness. Yet... I care. I've been with Staples three years, been almost every position, but I think I might have reached my breaking point.   I think it really depends on your SSM and GM. My store has some absolute shit tech sales, so I say bring in whatever you can, but technically all existing computers should be brought in under diagnosis and repair.   I installed Office on a computer the other day. Was I going to charge this person $160 + the install SKU? Hell no. For any security issue I probably would, though.   So far I've told three people, two with viruses, how much the whole thing costs. Every single one looked at me like I was insane. It's rough, especially when you live in the poor part of town.  	13
 It's a minimal retcon as a whole. Not so much the idea behind it.   And as for your comment on why things ended, plenty of gay men go through relationships with women all with different reasons as to why they end. It's just that they're most likely rooted in the fact that the man is gay.   Again, it shouldn't be the only reason Bobby is gay. But it's definitely some evidence to make the statement that he's gay.    Why does anyone a) think he's attractive or b) think he's worthy enough to be a judge of fucking anything? HE LOST!   Does not compute. Does not compute.   What? A fat joke about a fat queen? Wow, so original.   I really hope it's Ginger. I get that Violet really brings it in terms of looks and her presence, but her attitude turns me off. She reminds me of my 17 year old niece, and actually kinda looks like her surprisingly. While Violet is definitely in this competition to win it, I don't think she actually brings anything to it except being pretty. At least with Bianca, we have comedy. Jinkx, we have acting. Sharon, her strangeness. Raja, her androgyny and history of fashion. Tyra, nothing. BeBe, uh... her African-ness? I dunno. I thought Nina Flowers should've won. I don't want another vapid queen like Tyra to win.       I'm saying it isn't as far fetched as you're making it out to be.    Just because there wasn't evidence of it doesn't mean he wasn't. And there's some evidence: he was with Cloud, a character who was both man and woman, and his relationships with women seem to fail. While not the greatest evidence, it still helps solidify the notion he was gay. I'm not saying it's great writing, but it isn't anymore far-fetched than Wolverine being a Native American Lupine instead of a mutant or Xorn being Magneto and then not being Magneto.   And I keep asking why? Because he's been seen with girls? There's tons of gay-for-pay porn stars who aren't gay whatsoever yet they are involved with gay scenes. You're purposely putting this wall up saying "Iceman isn't gay and never was gay" and you're asking me why I call that closed-mindedness?    Being black isn't something you can hide. You can hide being gay. You can deny it for years. You can even be completely ignorant of the fact because it is internal. That's where it's closed-minded. You're saying there's NO possible way for Iceman to have ever rejected the idea that he was gay for so long that it became second-nature to ignore his feelings for men and focus on women.   But how? As I said, there are plenty of gay men who lead lives with women every single day. This isn't far-fetched. This is closed-mindedness. Sorry.    I am agreeing with you that this change is merely for sake of diversity. However, the biggest reason why they don't just make a new character who happens to be gay is because they've done that: Anole, Wiccan, Hulkling, Karma, and Daken. And they're not anywhere near as well-known or loved by fans because there's staying power when it comes to one of the original X-Men and their anti-heroes. It would've been a bigger gamble to make Wolverine or Gambit gay. Instead, they took Bobby "Iceman" Drake and decided to change his sexuality.  Here's where I'm going to argue with you about being inside Bobby's head: Bobby didn't even fucking know. It took Jean literally arguing with him and coming off a complete bitch for him to literally sit down with his feelings and contemplate. Because what took him a few comic book panels took me 13 years to realize in my life. I just wish I had a telepath to sit me down and tell me wholeheartedly I was gay. Further, tons of gay men have had long, meaningful relationships with women despite being gay. Some divorce their wives/leave their girlfriends. Some literally do not. So it isn't far-fetched for present Bobby to not be out or declare his homosexuality. I'm not using his 'short-lived' relationships as the ONLY reason he's gay. I'm saying it helps solidify it.  You're getting quite worked up over something that really won't change Bobby's character/personality. He'll probably still be quick-witted, snarky, and completely full of himself. But he'll be hitting on guys instead. So the fact that you're getting totally pissed about this character being gay does actually speak about something that might be based on ignorance or something homophobic or denial or that we do actually live in a heteronormative society where being gay is considered bad. I dunno. Maybe consider it instead of throwing your hate-filled sarcasm towards someone who actually has a history/knowledge of being gay in today's society and can actually see this happening in a comic book where people have superpowers and people come back to life and people's histories are constantly reworked.    And yet he's been with Cloud, a character who is both male and female. Also, gay men can have intense feelings for women, hence one-night stands or even long-standing relationships with women. A lot of gay men actually stay married to their partners due to love. This doesn't erase anything he's felt. Further, if they send the "past Bobby" back with this knowledge, new stories will be told instead of him with men.    That's like saying "the US Constitution wasn't written with same-sex marriage written in mind" so that means there shouldn't be same-sex marriage. Sure, Iceman wasn't written as a gay character in mind, but saying this would never happen in real life and then saying this retcon is a "hard twist" is just plain preposterous. If anything, and I'm not saying this is your intention, it comes off as partly homophobic. "He can't be gay because being gay means this and only this." Sadly, sexuality and the way we've handled sexuality for practically ever has caused these types of events to happen.   But that's what I'm arguing. People die and characters are brought back. Superman can only leap as high as a 'so-many' story building but now he can fly. Spider-man was never married to MJ or had a daughter. Wolverine isn't a mutant but a Native American Lupine. Sure, a lot has been said about each, but this isn't bringing someone back to life. This isn't giving someone a super power they never had. Or even ignoring a character's history. It's simply saying, "Hey, you've actually been gay this entire time and I, as a telepath, am forcing you to face it now rather than later." And that happens. Gay men are 40 or 50 before they realize they're gay. They're married, have kids, go to church before they truly realize they're gay. Iceman developed ice powers and was forced to deal with that his entire life. I can understand that homosexuality was probably the last thing on his radar.   	15
 Hmm salty bacon   My mom suffers from migraine, it started just having it once a month, then once a week, then more, and now she has it every two days. And when she has it, she's laying in bed for at least day.  Just two weeks ago she hit rock bottom and took a bunch of pills because she just couldnt take it anymore... she literally has no life. I'm super happy that she woke my dad up because she regretted doing it. They went to the hospital and pumped her stomach. I am still fuming with anger. It just feels so weird that she made that decision and i want to help her but i cant stop being mad at her. Event though i know i'm not helping her with it.

Its exactly what i meant, Dutch people who try to sound tough... just doesn't work.    Then who's the sorry bastard who gets chopped up in a million pieces like robot Frieza...    I have to stop cutting onions while watching this kind of stuff..    Its just a way of acting that we do in movies, it feels like they're acting like they are in a play instead of a movie... don't know how to describe it better, but everything is just so, exaggerated, the talking the hand gestures everything just feels so fake. I'm not talking about this movie though, haven't seen it :P    Never had Froot Loops, but they look disgusting...   I don't know what it is, but Dutch movies are so cringeworthy, i'm Dutch myself but people who try to sound tough in Dutch sound so silly.     I'd exchange it for Russian rubles...   Its legal here (Living in the Netherlands) i just never understood the fun of it... Maybe thats why it works here, it just takes the edge off your teenage acts of rebellion. Booze works though.   *sigh* Clash of Clans    "HEART HEARt HEArt Heart heart hear hea he h...."  	19

Every defendant has the right to the assumption of innocence, and to a vigorous defense at trial. But usually this level of comment from defense counsel is saved for the trial, rather than trying the case in the press by blaming the victim.  This particular lawyer, whose bread and butter is DUI cases, has a long-standing obsession with the way consent is defined. Is it ideological? Is it a career move? I don't know, but I do think this interview is over the top.      Reyes' attorneys are calling the women opportunists.  "What police failed to mention is that the victims were present during the game, called to Mr. Reyes, waited for him after the game," defense attorney Brad Koffel told the judge Tuesday. "They went out and had drinks afterwards. They voluntarily went up to his hotel room."  **None of which matters.** What year is this, anyway?

This bitter 111-day strike was more closely-watched than most strikes in the US because it was so violent and so disruptive to business. [This article puts the strike in context](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2006/01/mine-j25.html), detailing the history of both the industry and the union, in a way that other, less "biased" sources can't match.       In 1985, the strike by meatpackers at Hormel's Austin MN plant, represented by United Food And Commercial Workers Local P-9, was the cause celebre of the labor-oriented left in the US, gaining wide support nationally from everyone to the left of Ronald Reagan. Only a handful of trade unionists and labor activists disagreed with the strategy of the local, which pitted it against the national union as well as the bosses. P-9 supporters were outraged by the criticism, which history has vindicated. The dispute has long-lasting implications for all labor organizing, and deserves the closer look it did not get at the time.  The linked piece was written while the strike was ongoing, but it remains the most complete explanation of the issues. It's a very long read, but the key graf is this one:  The outcome of the struggle between industrial unionism and enterprise unionism will determine the nature of the labor movement in decades to come. Concessions can be won back in later bargaining, as many unions have shown. But a fundamental shift to enterprise unionism will destroy whatever class consciousness still exists in the labor movement.       I think you're just hating on radicals for no reason, frankly.   I can't read past this. You clearly have no idea how absurd that assumption is, but you should have caught a hint by now.   Yes, and that's one reason why I don't want to be the submitter there.   This is a noble effort, but it's unlikely that backpack was left there by its owner, don't you think? It's more likely that you found a pack that had been ripped off and discarded by the thief after everything of value was removed. If there was mail in it, it presumably showed a street address -- is there any possibility that you could take the further step of going back to the bridge, getting the pack and taking it to that address? Even if it's soaking wet by the time you get there, I bet Abigail G. would rather have it than not!   You did the right thing. I'm just amazed that they took the hint!   No. If you recognized my username, you'd know it's true. I've had to get mods and admins involved on more than one occasion. Having me as OP on such a post would get it downvoted and turned into a flamewar.  Why would you *not* want to do it?    Did it occur to you that a lot of those people have the same sort of analysis of all this that I have? Because they do.   I suspect that I have a better handle on who does this work nationwide than you do -- if we're talking about people who primarily build organizations and coalitions rather than people who turn out for demonstrations. In my experience, the latter group have almost no idea who the activists are *in their own cities*, let alone nationally, who have been working on this issue for decades. They often don't even know whether DOJ has had any previous involvement with police departments in their own state -- which is such basic ignorance it blows my mind.   There are *plenty* of very radical people involved in the national movement for police accountability, but they are not anarchists. They are people who have learned the cost of letting the perfect become the enemy of the good, and they are not about to let that happen again.  DOJ intervention does make a difference. I live in a city that was forced into a settlement, and although there are still problems, policing here is nothing like it was before. It is literally a life and death difference for people here, so hearing you dismiss it as "an attempt to sap the energy of movements with shallow reformism" is incredibly insulting.  I don't think you and I will get any closer to agreement with further arguments here, but please, get to know the people who were on this case before you woke up. It will expand your political horizons and give you lots more leaders to respect.

For *any* of the sacrifices made by American soldiers to mean anything, it's incumbent on *every* American to know and care about where and why that fighting is happening. Some wars are just, some are wars of aggression to control resources or trade.   I really hope your comment was just overgeneralizing, not jingoism.   Why is that?

Cats live to be older than many redditors reading this -- one of ours is turning 20 this summer. Pets are not props for a lagging social life, and they're not decor for a particular lifestyle. You don't "give away" pets when living with them becomes inconvenient. People who do this deserve sharp criticism, at best.   What will you do for them?

The  problems girls in co-ed schools have are of the sort that are hardest to see, because they consist of omissions: not being as assertive or competitive as they would if not competing for  approval from potential dates; not forming the same kind of intellectually-based friendships with other girls, etc.  EDIT: Adding, this is not just my opinion. There is plenty of research that has consistently found the same result over many decades: [single-sex school produce girls who are academically better prepared, more science oriented and more likely to continue their education.](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/graduates-of-all-girls-schools-85038)     He loves you!

Once I took the same snake away from her multiple times, releasing it back into a ravine nearby, only to have her go find the damn thing and bring it back over and over.

This is a terrible way to learn it, but perhaps your experience can help others get the lesson that cats *always* freak out during a move, and need to be carefully monitored during the run-up and contained during the move itself. Four of my cats flipped out and fled while I was loading the car for the last bit of a move, and I had to stay behind for three days in an empty house before I was able to round them up. I was lucky that time, but I should have known better because it wasn't the first time I'd lost a cat while moving.

It's a variant, as recognized here by at least two dozen redditors who upvoted it over the last two months.   I went to a prep school, not a Catholic school, and uniforms had been worn there since the founding. And our uniforms weren't just pieces you buy anywhere, they were made by one specific outfitter, so the price issue was even worse for students whose families were not rich.   Still, I'm incredibly grateful for having attended a school where uniforms were required and academics were primary. (I'm also glad there were no boys around to confuse us about how smart we all were!)     I'm not a reformist so I don't bother myself too much with the impact of reforms.  The reform struggle is the real world that you live in, and it's filled with people who should have socialist politics (and very often do), so you'd do well to start taking notice. It's not selling out to recognize, appreciate and even work in reform struggles -- but not knowing the whole political terrain in front of you is a serious mistake.    Starting up with uniforms meant having no hand-me-downs  My school and many others had a "little shop" where students could buy used uniforms for exactly that reason. Socks and shoes were the only thing we didn't buy used.   Shift dresses, yes; miniskirts, no. It would have to have been *very* late 60s for those skirts to have such high hemlines. In the mid-60s, the rule in many schools was still that the hem had to touch the floor when the wearer was kneeling. (I have no idea where that standard came from, but it was everywhere.)

 I don't get the waste problem. The amount of solar and wind infrastructure you'd need to build to produce comparable energy would require a *lot* of mining, manufacturing, and transportation, while consuming water and land resources and producing CO2, all of which are far less manageable wastes than a much smaller amount of spent nuclear fuel. The nuclear waste management problem seems like it should be far simpler to solve.   The way I see it, the carbon we prevent releasing today is worth far more in the long term than the carbon we prevent releasing 20 years down the road when renewables become fully realized.   Er, shouldn't it be much easier to set up a nuclear plant, which can produce huge amounts of energy from one plant for a large area regardless of geography, than huge land areas of solar and wind to produce the same amount of energy, which must take into account where's the best place to put them?  The long term cost in terms of climate change of waiting around for renewables to mature are going to be a lot worse than if we spent a little less in order to invest more in the one solution we know can compete with fossil fuels, today.   It seems to me that even compared to renewable energy, the environmental cost of nuclear energy is probably still less. The energy density of nuclear material is orders of magnitude higher than solar, wind, and fossil fuel, and it produces very little waste in comparison, and modern reactors are about as foolproof as possible. Converting to solar and wind require building a huge amount of infrastructure, that means mining, that means manufacturing, that means transportation, and batteries because solar and wind don't deliver base load power. Yes, it's far more environmentally friendly than fossil fuel, but that doesn't mean there aren't significant environmental costs in terms of CO2 emissions from manufacturing and transportation, environmental destruction from mining, toxic wastes from photovoltaics manufacture and mining, water consumption from manufacturing, land consumption from just having to take up a lot of land, consumption of nonrenewable elements from photovoltaic manufacture. And we're talking about technologies that have been maturing for decades and probably won't be fully realized for another few decades (we don't have that long in terms of run away climate change, if anyone's been paying attention to the Anarctic ice shelves). In comparison, nuclear has been mature for quite a while, it's the safest energy technology per unit energy produced (even, iirc, including casualties from horrible human precipitated disasters like Chernobyl), could have drastically reduced fossil fuel consumption decades ago and still could, and produces a tiny amount of relatively manageable waste, compared to all the environmental costs I listed above which apply even to renewables.   I can live with it. I love their use of light and color.   11/10 with rice.   Hi, new to the fandom. What do you call MabelxDipper ship?   Well the reality is that world growth rate peaked long ago, and as countries become more developed, they eventually start going negative in terms of population growth (ignoring immigration), so we should hit peak world population within the next century, or the next (the big uncertainty is what will happen to Africa). As far as food production goes, humans are actually pretty good at agricultural innovation: in the 20th century, food production grew 10x, while world population grew 6x. Most hunger in the world is not due to food shortage, but due to food inequality: systemic socio-politico-economic problems that prevent the poor from access to food even though there's plenty of food available (this is obvious in the US, but is also true in India, and really just everywhere, except war-torn and transient natural-disasters). So, many anthropologists, demographers, and developmental economists don't believe in the neo-malthusian predictions of the 60s onwards that population will decline due to massive mortality. The trend has been a decline due to low fertility, with low mortality. Development will naturally carry us over the hump of population growth towards a phase of population stabilization.  That said, I do agree we've been living on borrowed time, in terms of fossil fuels, eroded soils, wasted water resources, but I don't think it's a guarantee that we'll see massive mortality. Part of that is because it won't hit us all at once, so it really depends on if innovation and sociocultural attitudes catches up quickly enough.   Eyesphincters instead of eyelids.   WE ARE MEN AND WE ARE PROUD OF OUR BODIES BOTH LONG NOSE HAIRED AND OTHERWISE. SOCIETY SHOULD STOP TELLING US WHAT WE SHOULD DO WITH OUR HAIR.   IIRC, because humans are more effective, it's actually worth more to pay people to do it. The moral being that natural resources shouldn't be reduced to a simple economic price tag.   There's need to be like "family friendly porn" or "parent approved porn" sites which bundle sex-ed with 'realistic' porn. With like, "these are all the contraceptives these two actors are using you should be using contraceptives".   I'm not really a neo-malthusian.   No, I'm trying to convince you that 'extinction proof' or 'long lasting' has nothing to do with automation, *by definition*. Look up 'automation' in the dictionary. *I did not* make any comment about whether natural things can be automaton, as you would know if you actually read my replies.   Except that has nothing to do with the definition of automation. Automation is defined by the (minimal) degree of human intervention involved. It has nothing to do with how long something lasts. It is literally, etymologically, derived from 'self-operating machine' not 'long-lasting machine' or 'extinction-proof machine'. You're using the term wrong.   That said, evolution *is* progressive, because it is a process that happens through time. The problem is that lay people confuse later in evolutionary time with subjective ideas such as "better". From the paleoanthropologist's viewpoint, we know what are characteristic of humans today, we want to know what evolutionary events happened which led progressively to modern humans--this can apply to any species of study. Part of the problem is that scientists often resort to teleological colloquialisms in describing evolution, because while incorrect, it is much less cumbersome to say.   We know that brain size has little to do with inteligence. Sperm whales have brains 5 times as large us us, yet they aren't all that smart. And parrots (I think it's parrots, I know it's some type of bird) have us beat in brain to body ratio.  Brain size may not be comparable for distantly related individuals, but neanderthals are very closely related to modern humans, so brain size is one of the only ways of getting at the question of neanderthal cognition, even if it's not ideal. It's also not just size, it's size of specific lobes, which could indicate differences in certain cognitive faculties.   ...that definition makes no sense. Literally everything will waste away given enough time and entropy.   There are dozens of us!   Which if you think about it is quite counterproductive. It's economically efficient for multiple generations to live in the same household, particularly when it comes to supporting the elderly. Yet our independent attitudes have pushed families towards basically "sub-nuclear" families, for a lack of a better word. The single-person and couple-with-no-kids households are the most rapidly growing types of households. Which is great from an individual level (people shouldn't be pressured to have kids, especially women), but terrible at the societal level in terms of, because given that they have no support from working children, how are we as a society supposed to fulfill our promise of social security which they payed into by working for many decades, when the relative proportion of young working people supporting social security programs is declining?   Yes. We should trawl the atmosphere with great big balloons for helium.   Maud'dib!   I kinda disagree to the extent that I believe all nations will eventually drop below replacement fertility. Even the most fertile nations in Asia and Africa have already been declining for some time or have just begun declining (though fertility statistics are problematic due to high HIV mortality in some regions). For developing nations, fertility decline is really a matter of how fast women's education, reproductive rights, and contraceptive use spreads in a region, which is correlated but not entirely the product of economic development. "having more and more children to send to work to make ends meet" doesn't make any sense, if there are less migrant worker jobs, people won't have more children.   What does wisdom with age have to do with it? I will say that China will be hit less because they value filial piety more strongly, so people are more likely to support their elders instead of relying on a social security net.   The opening of Finding Nemo.   ...selectively nonneutral alleles are not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.   We should trawl the oceans for reclaimable plastic. Or bioengineer organisms to grow plastic from scratch, or to turn otherwise nonreclaimable plastic into reclaimable plastic.   Meh, am I the only guy who wants more "female friendly porn" in the market?   Turn old people into rain to help save California from drought. Got it.   Yup. Just look at Japan and Italy. It's not just aging, but also declining populations in developed countries = the ratio of young working people supporting ever older dependent people (in terms of social security programs) will be exacerbated.   I disagree, but I'm only replying because I thought the (un?)intended "short-lived" joke was funny.   It was a radiolab.   In developed nations, *population decline and aging*. Most developed countries are already near or at replacement level fertility (2.1 children per women), and European countries like Italy plus Japan are far below replacement level fertility. Developed countries like the U.S. are not shrinking pretty much only because of a high immigration rate. Combined with longer lifespans, this means we're gonna have very few working young people supporting a large population of old people, meaning, current social security programs will fail, and economies will suffer. This will become increasingly the case as underdeveloped nations catch up and eventually hit below replacement fertility (and for them, it will be exacerbated by their much more explosive population growth period, the 30-40 years of extremely high population growth in the recent past will hit them like a tidal wave worse than the stresses of baby boomer retirement on US social security).   ...You're right. I do like lettuce wraps.   Individual anecdotes should not dictate people's opinions of what should be done at the level of populations and societies.   Well yeah, 98% of those authors were undergrads, the vast majority of which won't ever have to worry about tenure. But if you're an older researcher who had a strong hand in the conception and coordination of such a large research project, that would come through, and would be quite a positive.   These people have worked full time for years on this research project, so I think it's justifiable for them to share authorship, as I think that would justify authorship on much smaller research projects. Even the person who contributed the most to this project didn't do more than 1/1000th of the work.   If you're working full time for multiple years on a research project, I think authorship is warranted.    but the title author carries more weight in the academic sector  This doesn't apply well to particle physics, where the field is used to having very large research projects, and whose author lists are alphabetized (note this paper is cited Aad et al. 2015 (Aad, Abayjan, Abbott, ..., Zwalinksi)).   *millions* of people, *thousands* of institutions   Spinach is a better option than lettuce in all situations where you'd use lettuce.   It's more fun to chuck wood chippers into newborns.   I mean I wouldn't do it unprotected nor if the dick as larger than a zucchini.   Or write a novel slash ampersand screenplay.   ;_;   Best story about an egg I've heard in years.   Polls on news media should have error bars and sample sizes.   I watch most things subbed. Except the shows I watched on Toonami and the like as a kid, I prefer the dubbed versions for sentimental reasons.   Why do you have an ostrich egg?   Do a separate weekly "classics" papers   Yup, agreed, reeks of ufoism as well.   It's not like teachers in high school are tenured professors. They're chained by state curriculums and pressure from administrators and the need to keep their job. While you are right *in theory*, in practice the intent of the bill is obvious. No teacher is going to suddenly start "help students understand, analyze, critique, and review the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses" of germ theory, atomic theory, cosmology, etc. (literally, most if not all of science is theory building). If you add things, you have to remove stuff, because there is only so much time in a year. So it's pretty clear that teachers can't tackle "all existing scientific theories covered", the only ones that they'll tackle, and which state standards will push, are the ones that offend the sensibilities of lawmakers, administrators, parents, or the teachers themselves. None of the curriculum changes at the state, district, or classroom level are gonna be peer-reviewed, so there's no quality control on what is taught as science or not.    some of best benders and nonbenders   I actually disagree. When the White Lotus Army first enters Ba Sing Se, shown are quite a lot more people in the army than just Iroh, Bumi, etc. They have no screentime, instead, we focus on the characters that we know best and who are yes among the best benders in ATLA. We aren't given any indication of how strong they are. And as a secret philosophical society, it's likely that a lot of the members aren't fighters. The ones who would go to Ba Sing Se would be among the strongest benders in the society.   It also makes some sense that the white lotus members doing daily sentry and guarding work, will not be particularly strong. The best benders in both series have always played big active roles as leaders in the world. I would probably consider Zuko, Tenzin, Chief Sokka as members of the White Lotus during LoK, even if it's not explicit. At the very least, Zuko and Tenzin are shown as superiors to white lotus members. So that bumps up their average somewhat.   I am flattered, but as someone who does research on evolutionary questions, I am not qualified to discuss current research into astrophysics. I do know some physicists who I could forward any questions you might have.   Well in some sense, what were the White Lotus supposed to do? They were a secret society, who very clearly exposed themselves to the world at a very important time to do a very important task (take back Ba Sing Se). There was no going back to being a secret.   Sure I can agree with that.   I'm not saying there weren't better ways OP could have phrased the question. That said, I think given that OP had clear misconceptions, your original answer should have had more tact and depth than it had, and address both the flaw in the question and the likely underlying question that was intended. As it was, it was not a useful answer. It's kind of like when people ask "Does X or not X?" and people answer "Yes."   Star Trek was always more about anthropological (in the sociocultural sense) progressivism than any kind of realistic portrayal of aliens. The minds of real aliens would be more incomprehensible to us than our relatives the squids. Their genitals would be less functional at impregnating humans as our relatives the squids.   Yeah, and that would be due to the latitudinal effect of solar radiation.   Meh, the Islamic world was a pretty happening place back in the 9th through 13th centuries. They had some of the foremost libraries in the world, they had algebra, and astronomy. The Christian world at the time was a joke in comparison. Religious societies do not exist in a vacuum, they are the product of various historical, political, economic, and sociocultural contingencies.   I mean, I would have interpreted "tend to" to mean, 'greater than on average', not 'greater than 50%'.   Africa actually has a wide range of skin tones. Not quite as white as Europeans, but there exists a wider range of hues than exists in Europeans. This reflects the fact that Africa is the most diverse place in the world in terms of human genetic diversity, and maintains a lot of heterogeneity in genetics and culture. In contrast, Western genetics, culture, (and skin tone) are a lot more homogenous.   On the mixed race thing, that applies to pretty much any minority population. It's true of mixed Asian-Europeans in Western countries. It's also true in Japan; mixed Black-Japanese, or White-Japanese people are not considered Japanese by fellow Japanese people, even if they are in all other respects Japanese natives, they'll still be treated as foreigners. It's a property of seeming to be not of the majority population, regardless of what the majority actually is.   Your designer's an idiot for giving humans blind spots. Apparently she (or he) likes cephalopods more, because at least cephalopods have the retina on the side of the optic nerves that actually makes sense. Who the hell puts the cables in front of the screen? For all vertebrates, yet puts the cables behind the screen, as where they should be, for all cephalopods?   I work in population genetics. Of course you can tell (based on sequence comparisons, of various sorts) what genomic fragments are related to what genomic fragments. Hell, you let me sequence your genome, and I can partition your genome into various ancestral populations of origin, whether that be N. Indian, European, Denisovan, etc. There are companies whose business models is doing this directly to consumer (23andMe and Ancestry.com) with the ultimate goal of improving medical treatment. It's not a matter of belief or theorizing. We're talking about decades of development in population genetics, statistical inference, bayesian inference, and more recently machine learning. And countless hours of algorithm development and computational time at universities, government labs, and industries across the globe. How bout we at least *try* to accurately describe the amount of work that has gone into this.    I think most can agree that the only reason evolution is still considered a theory is because we don't know what the "missing link" is  As someone who does research on evolutionary questions: go learn some basic evolutionary theory. Because, I can't even...      http://nextbigfuture.com/2011/03/deaths-per-twh-by-energy-source.html   http://nextbigfuture.com/2011/03/deaths-per-twh-by-energy-source.html   Far worse. Nuclear, even accounting for worst-case disaster estimates, is the safest energy resource in terms of casualties per energy produced. IIRC, coal is one of the worst, if not the worst.   ...which eventually goes into the groundwater.   A *lot* more people have dined from coal mining and oil refinery accidents than have ever been attributed to nuclear energy. Where does she think we get any resources from? The ground. All fossil fuels. All the metals and rare elements that go into building wind and solar.   Weren't they also operating past it's designed life time as well?   Garnet is Amon.   They're conditionally independent given GPA.   A nice pucker.   Half as long makes sense to me. In the both move case, motion of a person relative to the other person is twice that of the stand still case. It's as if the second person is taking twice as many moves per time step. This is ignoring boundary effects.   Alternatively, you can think of it as: 256 players mean there must be 255 games exactly, since every game results in exactly one loser of which there are 255. 255 games is nice because it is the sum of powers of 2, which is also the next power of 2 minus 1.

Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman is a riot, Feynman is a fascinating character. You should definitely read it.  The Selfish Gene, by Dawkins, is pretty classic at this point.

This is the closet thing I know of: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/04/140402-suspended-animation-gunshot-victims-science-death/  Basically, there are medical trials for severe gunshot trauma victims to replace their blood with a cold saline solution in the ER to slow down metabolic damage, in order to give an extra hour or two for doctors to do "damage control". Then they put the blood back in and restart the heart. I don't know what has come out of the trials.  I don't think we'll ever have cryosleep for deep space exploration. It's far easier to send the raw materials and create a human at the other end. Or send robots.   Science has already provided the answer: turn it into starch and alcohol.  http://www.pnas.org/content/110/18/7182.abstract   The global demand for food could double in another 40 y owing to growth in the population and food consumption per capita. To meet the worlds future food and sustainability needs for biofuels and renewable materials, the production of starch-rich cereals and cellulose-rich bioenergy plants must grow substantially while minimizing agricultures environmental footprint and conserving biodiversity. Here we demonstrate one-pot enzymatic conversion of pretreated biomass to starch through a nonnatural synthetic enzymatic pathway composed of endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolyase, cellobiose phosphorylase, and alpha-glucan phosphorylase originating from bacterial, fungal, and plant sources. A special polypeptide cap in potato alpha-glucan phosphorylase was essential to push a partially hydrolyzed intermediate of cellulose forward to the synthesis of amylose. Up to 30% of the anhydroglucose units in cellulose were converted to starch; the remaining cellulose was hydrolyzed to glucose suitable for ethanol production by yeast in the same bioreactor. Next-generation biorefineries based on simultaneous enzymatic biotransformation and microbial fermentation could address the food, biofuels, and environment trilemma.  tl;dr: be third of four in human centipede where the first mouth eats the door.

I think we won't know until we try it. It may be the case that GWAS does not deliver on it's "promise" (for a lack of a better word). There are diseases where genomic data will continue to enlighten, such as for identifying pathways which are mutated in cancer. Moreover, the technology that started with genomics has given rise to methods that have been used to look at the epigenome, the proteome, etc.   i think it's naive you think you know what his girlfriend would or wouldn't mind about their own personal finances, particularly given it's mother's day.   We'd still have molecular phylogeny, so we would eventually have a very good idea about how present day organisms are related to each other. We'd still have molecular clocks, though they would not be calibrated well. We'd still have ontogeny. We'd still have biogeography. We'd still have "living fossils" like lungfish to inform us of major transitions in evolution. Having molecular phylogeny is a huge asset, as it offers the *strongest* evidence we have for the common origins of life, but our picture of that tree, *especially* the morphology of prehistoric organisms, would be just a caricature. That said, we did roughly predict things like what Tiktalik would look like and where it would be before discovering it.   ...No patrick, mayonnaise is *not* an instrument.

Men who tell other men to "man-up" or "stop being a pussy" or otherwise perpetuate regressive notions of man-hood, particular when it comes to emotional or empathetic expression.   'MURICA   This is a bad time to say I like your username.   ELI4   I disagree with most of the posts in this thread. There are aspects of evolution that can happen quickly and predictably. I predict humans will evolve in the following ways in the next 100 years.  1) Increased admixture. With increasing globalization and relaxation of sociocultural attitudes, populations will continue to become less differentiated, and more people will be born of mixed population ancestry. Heterozygosity will increase, which ironically will decrease the prevalence of homozygotic traits. (We may see less red-heads).  2) Migration/Gene Flow. Pretty obvious. Related to admixture. Also influenced by globalization.  3) Host-disease evolutionary dynamics. Epidemics such as AIDS and Ebola have in the past few decades have selected for and will continue to select for disease resistance. Chances are there will be a few more such diseases this century, as long as there's still impoverished areas of the world without access to modern epidemiology.  4) Selective neutrality of previously deleterious diseases. As biomedicine improves, previously traits that were deleterious but persist in the population due to e.g. recessiveness, will become treatable and therefore neutral. The relaxation of selective pressure would allow such now treatable disorders to drift more freely in the population and increase. An example of this that is already happening is the observed increase in near-sightedness.  5) Genetic screening. Expansion of prenatal screening and women's reproductive rights will reduce the prevalence of very deleterious disorders. An example of this that is already happening is Down's syndrome, and there's no reason to not expect it won't happen with much more genetically influenced disorders such as Huntington's. This effectively removes these alleles from the gamete pool, and homozygous genotypes from the genotype pool.  6) Sexual selection, small selective coefficients, and genetic drift, will always exist to a limited extent.  7) Genetic engineering and gene therapy. There's a very real possibility that this will become a reality in the next century. CRISPR in humans may become a thing.  8) One demographic aspect of human evolution is that our population has grown tremendously in the past 200 years. As the rest of the world completes their demographic transition, the world population will eventually stabilize in population and actually start to decline somewhat (people in developed nations consistently reproduce at below replacement fertility). Exponential population growth has immediate effects on evolution, and this will shift as the world population enters a new regime of population stabilization and decline. One example effect of exponential population growth is that it introduces a lot of very rare variants quickly into the population, that is, many very rare familial diseases, which may soon go to extinction. It also means genetic diversity will increase as our effective population size catches up to census size (though this will happen over longer time scales than a century).  9) By demographic corollary, since African and to a lesser extent Asia will shoulder the brunt of the population growth in the next century (since most of the West has already stabilized in population), there will be a shift in gene frequencies at the global level. Africa in particular has always had the most genetic diversity of any human population, so we'll see a great expansion in the frequency of very diverged alleles that up until recently have only been found in isolated African populations.  10) Unexplored dynamics between an aging world population, longer reproductive spans, and selection.  tl;dr Evolution consists of the processes of selection, migration/gene flow, genetic drift, and mutation. It is also influenced by population structure and systems of mating. One or more of these will change in the next century, and thus human population genetics (evolution is defined as population gene frequency change) will change significantly, many of those ways being predictable.   As a math major who took a bunch of upper-level math courses working in a somewhat math related field, my opinion is that high schools should replace the standard two-course calculus track for the better students with at least one-course of statistics. Most people who take calculus will never need it unless they're going into a calculus-heavy subset of STEM. Almost EVERYONE can benefit from a strong statistical foundation IRL, and everyone in a STEM field including many others will use statistics. What surprises me more are how there are undergraduate majors in STEM that do not require a probstats class, or more than 1 semester's worth, because the only thing worse than no understanding of statistics is just enough statistics background to think you know it when you don't.   Not an online course, but the book "The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles"   Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind. Hiyao Miyazaki's magnum opus.

Mathematics is so often taught as a bag of equations and a small set of standard questions repeated ad nauseum. When in reality, mathematics is about abstractions, concepts, symmetry, generalizations, and soundly reasoned arguments, which your understanding of can only be solidified through application to problems which stretch and test your abilities and build your intuition. You have to get in there and actually manipulate mathematical ideas to understand them. Mathematics is all deductive, yet curricula only over explore it superficially, lacking the necessary depth to build true understanding.   No...   "No means yes."  No.  	109

I work with MMJ providers, caregivers, and dispensaries.  NM is a joke when it comes to MMJ.  If MMJ is something you are considering making a move around, look at CO, OR, or WA.  Those three states are much more friendly.     I've scrubbed the hell out of it sadly.  It's an older bottle and I'd hate to throw it out.  I just seems the elbow grease doesn't do the trick...   I think this whole thing is funny.  The ABQ police is so fucking trigger happy that they shoot their own.   Pass the knowledge!   I take salt, put it on a tray, and place it in a rolling smoker for a couple of hours.  I don't know how you wouldn't have luck with that...   These words are going on a shirt.   Thanks!  I like some sandwiches too.  Sadly, I live up in Santa Fe and I am hard pressed finding a good sandwich in this town.  So being the food guy that I am, I just decided that I was going to make some of the better ones in the area.  Trying to open up a truck up here though is one of the biggest clusterfucks I've come across.  However, I'm about to swing a deal with Natural Grocers and a couple of other stores down in ABQ to start making some grab and go snacks for their deli cases.  I'm thinking things like shooters, muffalatas, good salumi, etc.  None of that tuna and egg salad gas station BS...  What do you think about Bahn Mi Coda?   If you were looking for some seriously awesome BBQ and know what you are talking about when it comes to food, how could you be deterred by that place?  That joint looks run down as fuck and 100% legit.  Anyone running BBQ out of a joint like that HAS to know what they are doing...   Spices.  Salt in particular.  Simply because it means I can pack my smoke in my bag and take it with me :)   Back when I was applying, I was told there was no curb side vending.  I still don't see any of that.  Granted, I'm up in SF and don't see much.  But what I do is all on private property.   All I can say is I tried and would love to operate a truck in ABQ.  But they made it impossible for the most part.  This is just fucking stupid and it is unfortunate, because the good people of the city lose out.  And if any of you are curious, this is what I would love to be feed you folks...  http://imgur.com/a/BYZRe   you mean something like this?  With a side of sweet garlic chile?  http://i.imgur.com/uO4HCUM.jpg   Ya know, he just might.  I personally believe that his legacy and message will stand the test of time.      what in the holy fuck.   Ah!  Bend.  That is old stomping ground...  Don't sell the kitchen short.  Nor the venue aspect.  Both those items are awesome to keep people around.  Just shoot for them to be profitable. Or the gravy on the beer making.  Just don't do either half assed.    Look at the McMinimums for some awesome examples of some simply fucking stellar places.  They built their empire on beer.  Not renovating old buildings and slinging garden burgers.   First of all.  City and State man, city and state!  WTF is your demographic?  It don't mean nothing if you make better beer than the Trappists if you don't have people to buy it :)  What are the sales needed to break you even?  Those plans to me look like a cool $500K min if you are building from the ground up.    Oh.  And for the size and what you talking about doing, your kitchen is fucked.  Sorry.  Someone else said it, but plan the hood now.  Don't do it later.   Yeah...  So I made those tortillas from scratch.  And then proceeded to make them how I wanted to eat them.  So I think you should go fuck yourself and you should be ashamed for being an asshole.   WTF doesn't it go on?      As a professional cook, former restaurant owner, current cater, bar manager, and overall food professional I must politely tell you to go fuck yourself.  You are a great example of why this world is on a fast track to extinction.     If you ask in kitchen confidential, be prepared for a lot of backlash.  And some good advice if you can filter out the BS which will probably get thrown your way.    If you sacrifice cost in training, you will sacrifice value in your product.  Plain and simple.  One of the things I would suggest if you are seeing turn over and high costs in training is to change your hiring practices.  Or maybe there is a "weak link" in your kitchen somewhere that needs to be fixed.    It sounds like you need someone to come in and set up a program for you.  IMO.  But then again, I am a freelance restaurant "fixer."  I've built and ran kitchens, from small scale mom and pop (3 on the line) to corporate places doing $5K in food sales on a Tuesday for lunch.  However, my specialty is walking into a kitchen and finding an extra 5-10% yearly profit in a fairly short order.  So ask away.  But please also provide details about your shop.  A posted menu, location, demographic, sales, square footage, number of tables/seats, etc.  And pictures of your kitchen can do wonders.    If you don't feel comfortable posting this info online, feel free to PM me and we can take it to personal contact if you wish.  This is one time offer. I usually charge people good money for this kind of advice.  I'm just bored between gigs :)   I think the process was about 2 weeks in total?  Salt box for 5 days, desalinate 1 day, and an 8 day hang?  That sounds about right, I think?  I really should start keeping better records...      I'm assuming you mean breaded, not battered.  Battered is wet, breaded is dry.  If you are battering a pork chop, you are doing it wrong.  Try breading it in the following method.  You can't fuck it up if you do it like this.  Take your 1/2" to 3/4" cutlet and pat it dry.  Coat it in seasoned flour, dip it in egg, and then finally place in a large bowl with LOTS of breadcrumbs.  So much that when you place the chop in there, that none of the wet chop touches the bowl.  Only bread crumb.  Then gently press down on the meat to secure the crumb to the wash and toss some over the top to coat thoroughly.  Flip the chop over and press down again.  Then make sure the sides are sealed as well.  Place on parchment paper and into the fridge for 1/2 hour or up to 24 hrs.  Once the breading is soggy, it is worthless.  Making sure that you have a good seal on the coating is key.  It means it will stick together.  It also means that if it is cooked properly, it will crust and keep your meat juicy and moist.  In a hot hot pan pour in enough oil to come up half way on the chop.  Just as the oil starts to shimmer, gently place the chops in the pan.  DON'T TOUCH THE FUCKING CHOPS.  Turn the heat down to mediumish.  After about 3 minutes, gently shake the pan.  If chop slides easily, it is time to flip it over.  With a fish spatula (google it if you need), not tongs.  Another 3 minutes, it should be good.  If you are doing clams this way, just fry them till the breading is golden and you're good.   Those are pretty neat.  Other than knife handles, I've always wondered what small pieces of antler shed could be used for.   It is a sandwich.   Those people are fruitcakes.  I mean, melts?  I mean, they don't know what a sandwich is?        Thanks.  I'm starting to love working with the laminate dough.   Honestly, I don't want to burst your bubble, but you really won't want to do it.  The thing isn't just big enough.  By the time you're done sinking in the $250 in all the controls PLUS having spent all the time doing the conversion work, you will probably be mad that you can only do one 3# piece of bacon at a time.  I speak this from experience.  I know you want to do it and if you can, here is my suggestion to keep you happy.  Make a deal with a friend who has the room or a garage for a full size fridge to convert.  Or get another place.  Something that a lot of people would never think about is a small storage unit.  They are usually are all pest controlled,  24 hr access, and have electricity inside...   Veggie burgers of sorts.  Make the mix, shape them, and freeze them on sheet pans before placing in a ziplock.  Or you can freeze them in a stack between parchment paper.   Man.  I don't really recipe so much :(  The jam filling was (all approx) 2 parts blue to 1 part black, white sugar, honey, vanilla,  and salt.  The mascarpone cream was 8oz of mascarpone, 4oz of cream cheese, juice and zest of one lemon, powdered sugar.  Danish dough is 8# flour, 2# water 1# sugar,  3oz yeast, 3# butter.    I know all of this ALMOST helps...   a shot of them being made...  http://i.imgur.com/nLIxt8Y.jpg      Properly.      Don't waste your first go around trying to do a panchetta hang.  You'll probably fuck it up and be pissed at the wasted product.  Strip that belly down into 3 or 4 chunks and start with a couple of simple bacon cures.  Remember, to learn how to ride a bike, you have to know how to walk.   WTF?   Hopefully you got to see some of the farolito madness.  There sure were a metric fuckton of people out on Canyon...   caja china?   Include me!  I'm on the internet bandwagon!   I know.  It's just not nearly as fun to say.   The change is in management.  It is moving from being a grand experiment of a National Preserve to becoming apart of the parks department.  Or maybe USFS, but probably Parks.  This change means many things.  The number one thing that is being fought is paved roads.  Currently, once you exit off of Hwy 4, you hit dirt road.  There are no paved roads in the Valles Caldera and it has been that way intentionally.  Both Parks and USFS have said that one of the first things they want to do if they are granted control, is to put paved roads in so there is easier access to the public.  That is fucked.  This land needs to be preserved and should have the public even further restricted, rather than encourage more traffic.  This change is bad for national security via LANL, the Pueblos, local environment, and will be devastating for the Jamez valley.  All everyone ever talks about when it comes to public land is "let the public on it!"  The problem is that the majority of the public is fucking stupid and are negligent to the wonderful things they are given.   broiled Heirlooms and manchango  some kind of hung bacon I don't know when or how I made  eggs  grilled spilt muffin  Goulden's mustard.        Go to the Valles Caldera.  The way it is operated and overseen is about to change and this will probably be the only chance you will have to see any of it in it's current state.  Which is sad :(  http://www.vallescaldera.gov/  And just down the road from there is Bandelier.   I don't know if I'd ever use it in a professional kitchen, but I grind down 1 T of MSG with about 2 cups coarse kosher for my personal use.  And well, french fries at my house at just a little bit more awesome.    Just like using salt as a seasoning, you shouldn't taste MSG if it is used properly.  Maybe that is a personal opinion, I dunno.  But I love the shit.  Nothing wrong with a little Sazon Goya in the pot from time to time.  It is a shame that it has gotten such a bum rap over the years.   This was not made with a waffle iron.   Because most people want to eat my sandwiches :)   Fresh mozz, smoked gouda, pepper jack, pecorino, parm, and possibly something else?   Homemade pancetta, heirloom tomato, broiled multi-cheese, green chile, sourdough.   Always.      I love it when uneducated people talk about food.     Jacques Pepin.  Most of his Fast Food My Way series is on youtube.   There is only one person who can utter those words and have others truly appreciate how magical they are.  Ding!    I appreciate it.  I understand what you mean by pinning now.  It was just a different term than what I'm used to.  As to the weights, I misunderstood what you meant as pinning.  Not ingredients, just silly me.  The dough is currently being run through a sheeter, 3 folds.  I'm not going to stop and measure the fold, it is all done by eyeball and feel.  There is too much other dough going through the sheeter, we honestly don't have time.  Hence the product loss as it currently sits.  We are making so much of the product that the scrap is (sadly) a loss leader.  Which is why I want to salvage it.  I feel like I have the majority of the current scrap figured out and recycling a bunch more will almost eliminate it.  I hope.  We just have to bear through this holiday pie and cookie overwhelment before we can do anything.  240 dozen triple colored cookies is no BS...  I have been debating on doing the third fold a 1/4 fold and then doing a final fourth before shaping and forming.  Do you think that the fourth fold is excessive for packaged goods?  I don't know much about any of this baking nonsense.  And what I do know is Suzi Q homemaker bullshit.  What I know how to do is cook ;)   Savory is the direction I'm  leaning.  I've been playing with a few things, but nothing has stood out yet.  I dig the idea of the egg cup, our main hindrance is a 2 day shelf life and non refrigerated.  I know I can secure refrigeration space at several accounts, but that is down the line.  We currently do cinnamon rolls/twists/mini twists, caramel nut rolls, spiral jelly filled, bear claws, cheese pockets, croissants, and choco croissants with our danish.  Hot pockets.  TheSparrow16, you might just be a fucking genius.  Nobody in our area is doing anything remotely like that.   I would do that, but there are 2 competing bakeries in the area who share shelf space with us.   Recycling is something we've been talking about, just haven't had the time yet to play with it.  The main priority we had first with this dough, which I think is a solid product now, was changing around the ratio.  We needed to work with a fucked up dough for a few weeks, simply because a prexisting business was purchased.  We couldn't change the dough from day 1...  I've never seen dough pinned or weighted.  What do you use for to do that?   We already have a similar product.   We tried pie toppings.  Unfortunately the dough rises to much for the clam shells.  We also don't have a fryer (the one piece of missing equipment in the kitchen) and make 11 different kinds of packaged pastries.  I don't think we have the shelf space to add another.  All of them also sell fairly well, but maybe I should look at sales and replace one?  Also, I've never tried to cut pastry dough by hand, like you would donut to make fritters.  Does it work the same?  Fuck up the dough?  Apple fritters are fuckton pain in the ass to make by hand, if in batch.  I'd imagine this would be the same?   Grill pan.   Hydrate.  Keep your blood sugar in check.  Stay away from white drugs.     Hit up Johnny's.  http://johnnyspoboys.com/   If you want to come out here and see "the magic of SF," you need to come at a different time of year.  Late summer when the markets are happening.  There are an additional 60K people coming and going week in and week out for a couple of months.  If you're into that kind of stuff, this is an awesome place to be.    However, since I speak the basic facts about the area, people tend to think I'm negative about it here.  Truth be told, I love it to a certain extent.  And I can't wait to move.  But if people ask for advice about moving here, unless you fall into a very specific category (read rich and white), the general attitude of those that have moved here is stay the fuck out.  Which is really sad, cause we all WANT it to be the magical place people talk about.  It just ceased being that about 20 years ago :(   Meh?  The girlfriend is a veggie.  So more for me!   There is no night life here.  One club that opened up about 6 months back.  One gay bar that has been open and closed off and on for the last 3 years.  A couple of casinos 1/2 hour outside of town have dance floors and bars.  Museums, there are a lot of.  However, you can walk through most of them in 30 minutes having seen everything.  The same with the gallery.  You can make an afternoon looking at the dated southwestern art in the gallery lined Canyon Road, but many find it lacking and way over priced.  Outdoors right now is meh.  It is beautiful here, the only redeeming factor of SF is access to the outdoors.  Cold and wet, some snow in the hills.  If you want to ski, head to Angel Fire.  Or Wolf Creek up in CO.  Sadly, Ski Hill Santa Fe is a terrible place to waste a vacation if you can go elsewhere.     Most of the area is safe to stay in.  Anywhere downtown is fine for the most part.  If you get to the south end of town or on Cerrillos, it can be a little sketch when it comes to hotels.  There is not much here to do.  This town is geared towards 55+ blue haired old ladies and uppity yoga people.  If you make  weekend of this town, you'll not want to move here if you want any of the basics you'll find in the city.  Other than the cost.  This place is expensive as fuck to visit and more so to live in.  Also, this town basically shuts down around 9pm.  Santa Fe is worth checking out, but if you are driving here from a ways away, I would suggest you hitting some other places in the area too.  Taos, Red River, and Angel Fire are all resort towns with kick ass skiing right now.      A good area to stay in is one that is far away from Santa Fe.  Seriously.     Grilled Sourdough  Hot Italian Sausage, parsley, parm, scallion, and cured wax pepper "salad" with browned Pecorino crust  Roasted heirloom tomato with caramelized mozzarella      Usually somewhere between 1/4" and 3/8".  1/2" is just too much!   Lollers!  Fuck your owner man, that is complete bullshit and illegal as fuck.   Check out couchsurfing.com,  I have a few friends in the ABQ area who do such things.  I'd offer, but I'm up in Santa Fe and busy today...     Holy hell.  Such a nice haul for so late in the year.  I guess global warming is good for something...   Does it have to be something they will use at work?  That almost seems like a double sided gift, but we all know we love our knives.  Find out what your staff has at home and get them a little gift bag of professional grade tools for their house.  Silpats, half sheet pans and some off set spats.  I'm sure someone would love one of these:  http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-DLC-10S-Classic-7-Cup-Processor/dp/B00004S9EM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1418537945 sr=8-2 keywords=cuisinart+processor#  Maybe your pastry chef has never bothered to pick up a Chinois of their own? Custom leather knife rolls?     Hydrate.  Keep your blood sugar in check.  Have an extra back up of everything you normally need to restock.  Don't do knife work on the fly.  And Stop stressing so much.  If you want to do this job, you'll get it down.  You've been there two months with little experience and they are handing you proteins to cook?  Kudos.  Most people need to spend a few months on fryers or salads/desserts before they are given proteins to fuck up and waste.  Don't be afraid to ask for help.  Don't ask for help unless you actually NEED it.  Learn how to ask for help the right way and you'll get it every time you ask.  No BS.  There are ways of doing it.  One of em is to be damn sure that when you do ask, you need it and you need it fucking now.  If you look like you are flailing or a deer in headlights, I will lose respect for you.  If you're calm and calling for it as 6 orders ring in behind 12 pans working, you got it brother.  I got your garlic, don't worry about it.  Talk to your boss.  Explain to him that you want to succeed and you would like to insure you're learning daily how to be more efficient and skillfully productive.  That you're concerned you're not moving along fast enough and ask boss what they think you need to focus on.  It will be appreciated.  And if the boss looks down upon you for coming to them or doesn't help you, GTFO of that kitchen.  It is not worth your time.  The number one thing I wish that all people would do is say "I don't know if I'm up to speed or comfortable."  I would rather train you and work beside you or shift people around on stations, than deal with fallout from stupid fuck ups that are preventable.   Calabrese  Brined and smoked pork loin  Sopressata  Parm  Pecorino Romano  Heirloom tomatoes, butter lettuce, parsley, scallions  Mama's Special Sauce  Hoagie      Honestly man, you're in for a shit show for a while if you do this.  I mean, nepotism isn't looked highly upon in the first place, but when it is someone with NO practical or relevant experience in a kitchen, it will be worse.  If you do take it, ask the best (notice I didn't say the one you like the most) individual in the kitchen to hold your hand and offer them a raise.  From there, you need to spend an additional 50% of your weekly hours in study.  So if you're doing 60 hour shop weeks, you really need to be doing 90 with food or business related.  Here's the deal though. You don't know how to cook.  Don't touch the fucking menu.   Meat and vegetables  ;)      Yeah.  I'm making another plate of that right now.  I hate myself sometimes, but it was just so damn good.      This is the run.  There is another way south from what I've been told, but I'm not a boater.  I just come along for the float...   There are also some easy floats on the Rio.  You just need to know where to put in and take out...   Yes.   Fuck me, that is what I meant.  Sausage Shop.      Yeah, I'm bummed I found it this last trip around.  I've been out that way a few times in the last year and have been looking for some killer snacks.  I would like to think of myself as somewhat of an authority on sandwiches (below is a link to my from scratch work) and this place is legit.    Best part IMO?  No seats and standing room for 10, maybe.  As far as my tab?  Meh.  Too much to read on the wall.  I told the lady to give me 2 awesome sandwiches, 3 good size chunks of salumi, and a half dozen of them jerky sticks.  $33.  For fucks sake, I'm coming back.  http://imgur.com/a/BYZRe   I'm sorry.  It makes me cringe for the folks making what they know to be a substandard product.  It would be in greater favor of the shop if they simply provided something for customers that was meant to go.  Like a simple non-bake budino in pre portioned to-go ramekins?  A couple of sauce/toppings in 1oz to go's and they walk out the window in a plastic bag in 30 seconds.  Saves time and the customer gets their pudding.   WTF?  Ya'll serve creme brulee to go?  Why would you sell a substandard product that gives people room to bitch?   It is pretentious and egotistical to think that a private place of business should cater to your specific needs.  Plain and simple.  So fuck those people who demand it or think it is ok.  It is a choice of the business to do so.  It is unfortunate that people think you have to suck everybody's dick that comes through the door for the dollars they MIGHT spend.  With that said.  I build menus that are inclusive of such people.  Which is what I encourage others to do.  Beat them at their own game and provide them specifically with a product.  And let them know - that's it bitches.  That's all you get.  If you don't like it, I don't know what to tell you.  But there are no mods, aside from very simple and basic ones, that happen to my menu.    However, anything that I put on a menu that was that specific would be so fucking spot on that other people would order it.  That is how you deal with it.  There are so many other things to be concerned about and yet every fucking week people are bringing this shit up.  Get educated, do something about it, and grow some balls.  Tell people what they can and can't have if they come in with limitations.  Just make sure that what you give them isn't bullshit.   My complaint is not about customers at all.  It's about those here and others in the industry not being educated enough to call people out on their shit.  My complaint is also about all of those in the industry who don't have the balls to tell these fucktards NO.  You DON'T HAVE to cater to them.  You don't have to be a dick to them, you can be nice.  But when you or others encourage their behavior, it makes ALL of our jobs harder.   I was just thinking the same thing.  I live in a town full of uppity rich white yoga bitches that would eat that shit up and then talk to their friends about how such a good deal it was...   Once I can stop from having to correct idiots who open their mouths on subjects they know nothing about or spread misinformation on, I will.  Until then, absolutely not.  I might be a loud asshole, but I'm also right.   The point is the assumption is that you are born with it.  It is developed.  Anyone who actually has Celiacs knows this.  People who want to talk about Celiacs (which is EVERYONE in this sub) should know this.  Sadly though, people talk with authority on the subject and can't even bother to find out yesterday's news without opening their mouth.   Ok.  The posting read to me that you're working for a shop and looking to host.  I guess I read into that, but it isn't completely clear that you are a 3rd party all around.  So are you trying to facilitate a job fair?  It sort of sounds that way and honestly, somewhat of a decent idea.  But what would be the end all goal?  If an event is free, usually the customer is the product...   I copied the link wrong.  And no.   Ok, fair enough.  Somewhat.  There is a big difference between knowing a lot of people who have a genetic condition and knowing a single family whos legacy includes one.  Your statement is misleading.  It is also a inherited trait which is triggered.  In many cases (I'm not saying all or in your friends) parents who actually do have Celiac's automatically treat their children as if they do and will tell them that they do without a diagnosis.  Simply to either help prevent a trigger from happening because they know that the gene is passed, or to make their own life easier.  There is scientific data to back up the last statement as well.  If you would like to understand Celiac's more, check out this snippet from U Chicago.  http://www.uchospitals.edu/pdf/uch_007936.pdf   Ta-Lin has canned Italian winter truffles in water.  It's a decent product, but spendy.  Last I saw was about $25 for 5oz drained weight.  Or something like that.  Also check out the Shamrock restaurant supply warehouse.  They usually keep a very similar product on their shelves as well.  	122
 No matter what, I think most community fans would need the distance between 1,2,3,5,6 and 4.    I would say that episode was top tier for me but the season wasn't my favorite (still great though). My season ranking would go 253614   Yes, I just said they weren't released with the episode number in the title. The Force Awakens will still have Episode VII on the scroll from what I've heard   It takes place 70 years before Harry was born so maybe Dumbledore. We don't know many characters in that Era yet   Holy Shit, is this for real?! I cannot wait   Discussions when it comes out and news articles right away i have no problem with. Like i said, its all of the specific questions, b-roll footage, and very specific news articles that are coming out now and that get posted and reposted. There have been more posts about Mad Max that should be on that specific subreddit than any other movie to come out since ive been on reddit. Even more than Marvel movies. It's the reason subreddits for specific movies or franchises exist.   Basic Crisis Room was up towards the top of the list for me. It was the first episode of the season that it felt like a group again. Plus, Olives.Need more Olives   Every trailer should be either like the "next week on Mad Men" or "on the next Arrested Development". Either show a bunch of clips that gives you absolutely nothing of story or give you entirely different clips than are even in the movie.    Thought it was better than the last few seasons of the show. The ending was satisfying. Nothing unexpected but still good in my opinion.    Same here!    Totally agree, saw it as well   No problem, enjoy the movie! Ill be seeing it again on Friday   maybe... Probably... Maybe.    Haha for sure! Yea, check out the Chromecast. I absolutely love it for all streaming apps.    ...maybe...probably...maybe   Yea, I don't see who you are talking about. But I do see Custodian Lapari and Professor Cligoris   It was November so maybe. But I'm not sure   Wow, it's close between Modern Espionage, Basic RV Repair and Palmistry, and Emotional Consiquences of Broadcast Television. There were so many though   They are doing it to go back to how the originals were without the episode number in the title. It's still Episode VII and is referred to as such by lucasfilm and Disney, it's just not in the title   Wow that was an amazing episode!  If that is the series finale, I've finally made peace with it. If there is more,   I will be first in line to watch.    What type of phone do you have? If it's an android, go buy a Chromecast for $35 bucks. Then you can watch it on your TV easily   She actually is hilarious but she has been type cast and put in some terrible roles.    He was and I laughed my ass off   Both of those are very good choices, enjoy!    Ha, thanks for finding my post! /u/ledivin, if you've seen quite a bit of the series, you will be just fine. It starts with clearing up a few things that happened at the end of the series. Go see it, it's very entertaining   I'd say it goes 2143   Cool, here are my suggestions based on your taste. Sons of Anarchy (All seasons on Netflix), Community (Seasons 1-5 on Hulu, season 6 on Yahoo Screen for free),  Workaholics (All on Hulu), True Detective (HBO), Party Down (Hulu), Breaking Bad (Netflix). If you want some more, let me know   Give me your top 10 favorite shows whether it be comedy/drama/sci-fi. Then I'll try to give some suggestions   I also just watched that one for the first time ever and loved it. Maybe it's the kid that still exists in me   Alien/Aliens. They were awesome. Dated but awesome.    It was a few episodes back, the same guy at the same bar did the same thing   It was easily the best. It was brand new the last time I went and it was glorious.   /r/community begs to differ, we talk about it constantly. But yes, the show is still amazing and the media should be covering it more.    The movie should start abruptly towards the end of a brutal game of paintball. And then it finishes and the rest of the movie begins   Because people are morons. Also, why were you on Craigslist looking for tickets if they are no where near sold out?    Mad Max: Fury Road. For anyone that wants to post another question specifically about the movie, b-roll footage, random news articles about it, /r/MadMax and /r/FuryRoad exist.    If that's not a finale vibe for you, I don't know what could be.   Thirdeaned   Britta too! It was so funny. I loved it   Can't wait!    Yea! at the ice cream shop in Diagon Alley!       Haha, yea, I don't think anyone would care if the idea didn't come from her. And people do care a lot because she wrote the screenplay   Absolutely! I've had every kind they make. Cold, Frozen, Soft Serve, and my personal favorite, Hot! So good   This is actually the third Park. There is one that opened in 2014 in Japan.   I'm really excited. I love the one I  FL but I travel to California every year and don't go to FL very often.    Yea, I actually liked the main cast. The show just didn't connect with me   I think they wrote it in because they thought Chevy might leave the show. He wanted to stay so they wrote him back in I believe   Can't wait to have some Butterbeer in Hollywood!    I watched the first 3 episodes. It felt like a sketch in a sketch comedy show that went on way too long. It was funny until it didn't end and move on to the sketch. That's just my opinion though. I could see why people like it. Just not for me   Hey, we agree on that!    It was one post, if you thought it was a bad one, you could have just downvoted. Clearly on that one post, my sarcasm wasnt that thick. But I think anyone who has seen a Star Wars movie knows which ones came out when. Hence my sarcasm.  You are right about my comment karma, didn't look at it and typed the wrong number.    Same topic, same original thread. You still said it. I do know how to edit my post, I just replied again to make sure you saw it.   I understand where you are coming from. And to be very technically correct, you are right. But prequel is a modern term used for all movies these days and by that definition, Phantom Menace is a prequel not a sequel. I don't care that much, I only said it because I made one comment about a chronological 4th movie and you came at me about it not being a sequel. I know that. That is obvious.   As for my original post, I'm not saying it is a good joke, clearly because people are downvoting me for it, but nevertheless was my intention and I think that was clear to most people that I didn't actually think it's a sequel.   I have 15000 comment karma because I contribute to threads rather than calling people out for a sarcastic comment   I wasn't wrong. A New Hope IS technically the 4th movie in the franchise. You are right that it is not  a sequel and I never contested that. And you did bring up a prequel. You said The Phantom Menace is the 3rd sequel when actually it's the first prequel.   My initial post WAS a friendly joke. I even stated it as "Star Wars: A New Hope is technically the 4th movie..."    No shit, I'm not saying episode 4 is a sequel. I replied to this thread saying A New Hope because it is technically the 4th in a franchise. He also didn't ask for prequels. Like you are commenting about. My initial comment was a simple friendly post that was sort of a joke. You had to come at me and be a "technical" asshole   You came at me because I didn't use a reply that directly correlated to the topic because I was a smart ass and replied with a fourth movie not technically a third sequel. The  you defined a sequel and got all mad because I didn't post a actual sequel. Then you respond with a prequel. So by definition, your response is also not on topic.    Again, you just aren't getting it   If you are going straight up technical, you are wrong too. Episode I-III are prequels and OP said sequels.    No, you are not getting it.    Jesus, I understand what he meant. I even said it "technically is the 4th movie.    OP also said "4th movie"   He is too busy crushing it as Koogler on Community   Star Wars: A New Hope... That's technically the 4th movie  Edit: Just so /u/Daxtreme knows that I understand the movie listed is actually the first released and is not a third sequel and this post was sarcastic. Also, he didn't believe I knew how to edit a post.   Totally understand where you are coming from. Thanks for the reply   I'm excited! I really enjoyed the first season. Very intriguing   Why did you hate that?   "Star Wars Spinoff"... Major clickbait. But even so, sounds interesting   It's an original story based upon the character who wrote the textbook. And the screenplay is written by JK Rowling herself. It will be awesome!   Public Enemies is a great movie!    It was entertaining and the Cinematography was great. But it was one long action sequence with little story, little character development, and a lot of weirdness to the universe. The action sequences were cool but became repetitive and they are being praised as a return for practical effects when tons of movies have begun to do that in recent years but just haven't shined a light on it.    If Dan Harmon was doing it, I'd watch it for sure, but I don't know how much more you can dilute this show. Removing main characters has proved a major challenge but they have made it work. I just don't know how good it could be.    He has hits and misses. I feel like people either got sick of his type of comedy so they see it as repetitive, don't like his type of comedy from the start, or just don't understand his type of comedy (it's supposed to be goofy and stupid.) Today's comedy is a lot smarter and dumb comedy has lost its place.    Just so you know, JJ Abrams has spoken about that he has made a point to limit the nostalgic moments and references. He even filmed some and cut them out because he realised it was not pertainent to the story of the new movie   Totally agree, just watched Jurassic Park 3 after not having seen it since probably 2003. It wasn't perfect but I thought it was a solid sequel.    Well then, here it goes. I like Adam Sandler   I thought Mad Max: Fury Road was just ok. Not bad but also not the masterpiece most people on here thought it was.    Yea, and the production code is 303 because it was filmed out of order. That's the reason for the dialogue too   It's too late. This sub is one of the worst with spoilers. Especially with New episodes debuting at midnight or so (depending where you live). People like me who work during the day and can't watch until night get screwed from posts like this.   Those are some funny movies. I'm not saying Entourage is the king of comedy, it's not even close to my favorite show. But it's entertaining and actually does have some good writing especially in season 5. There was just no reason to troll on something you dislike when it's a thread for people who like it.    Sorry, it's not your thing bro. Have fun trolling bro. Don't know what the hell you are talking about with the advertising bro. I'm also not OP bro. I've already seen the movie bro. I'd be curious to hear what you consider good comedy bro?   Did you actually sit down and watch episodes and follow the storyline with an open mind. Or did you half pay attention with your mind already set that they were douches?   If you don't like it, that's fine. Comedy is subjective, but no need to troll on a thread about a show/movie you clearly hate with a passion.    You clearly never watched the show then. Yes, the show does include the party lifestyle of a good looking Hollywood actor and his buddies. But to generalize that as the entirety of the show is moronic. Especially not having seen it. You also need to keep it mind it's a comedy show with drama interwoven. Not just a drama show.   Let me put it this way, I think The Big Bang Theory is the worst show on television, but I had the sense and respect enough to watch episodes of it here and there to gauge my opinion on the show. I go in with an open mind and come out still not liking it, but at least I give it an honest shot.    Yea, Old Republic would also be very cool. The numbering would reset because it would be a new series. But it would be like Star Wars Anthology and have another name. Terrible example here but something similar to "Star Wars Eternity: Episode I". Again, terrible title I know, but you get the idea   Did you ever watch the show or are you just making assumptions on the random footage you've seen or because other people hate on it? Yes, the characters are your typical loud new York guys and Hollywood stars but the show in the early years was actually very interesting and by season 5, it had some really great story.   Plus, your username is "Coloradobro" and you call us tools bro? Not cool bro.    Reboot is not the best word. But what I meant is for basically a continuation but a brand new series. It wouldn't rewrite anything, it just would be completely new characters decades after the originals and sequels. I think it could be a great way to continue without messing with the other movies or trying to redo them   It was like 2 weeks into the season. I cast from the app both on my phone and tablet   They are at different Parks because that was the only two spaces available for such a large construction and Diagon Alley was constructed over a year after Hogsmeade had opened. Is it also genius business-wise? Yes. But if you do your homework before buying tickets (I know you didn't have a choice) then it's pretty clear. I bought the park to park pass last time I was there and it was incredible.    I think they will reboot the series but not in the usual fashion of rebooting. It will take place in the same universe as 1-9 but start the numbering over with a brand new story, all new characters, and maybe decades beyond the Skywalker family story.    There are a ton of cameos but the movie, as opposed to the trailers, handles them on a much smaller level. Most of them are quick some have larger parts in the movie.   As for the storyline, it's like you described, which happens all the time in Hollywood but it's really interesting. Especially with Ari   Not sure if you watched it the show Heroes but Sky's storyline reminded me of the first season of that show which was great.    I saw it a couple weeks ago, if you liked the show (especially seasons in 1-5 like I did) then you will enjoy the movie. It's a lot of fun and holds up to the series. It's better than the last few seasons. It's not perfect but it's very entertaining and has a pretty good story. It's back to the best part of the show, the behind the scenes of making movies in Hollywood. People will be happy to know it's very Ari centric as well which is great   I've said it before in a similar thread but I'd like to see just another random episode. Not elevated at all. No finale vibe. Just another day with the Gang. The end of the episode would be Mac busting into Paddy's yelling "Guys Guys Guys! I've got news!" cut to black and it does the usually title card (12PM. On a Tuesday. It's Always Sunny...) all while Mac and the Gang are talking about the next plan. I like to imagine the Gang just continues their schemes after we leave them.    It might be your internet or device. I haven't had an issue with it since then   No problem!

 Please dont claim that activism is wrong in any way. I know that may not be what you mean (or maybe it is) but it sure sounds like it   Hmm so kind of like Christianity  "But marxism endorses mass murder..." can you point out where it says that in the Communist Manifesto  "But the Bibile says nothing about that" neither did marx  IMO Socialist Democracy, implemented in places like Norway and Sweden, works best   TBH, It would have ended more like Bahrain if anything occured at the worst case   Trump, when you just go and kill everyone you suspect of terrorism and topple a government, it breeds radical ideology  Perhaps this is hard for you to believe, but most countries the US has invaded dont go "YAY the US is coming to save us all!" It  just makes them hate you more, and hate breeds radicalism. so MAYBE STOP DESTABILIZING PEOPLE DAMNiT   No you just either 1) Dont know history 2) Refuse to acknowledge when your party is wrong or 3) are trolling    Here is how  Saddam Hussein was a horrible dictator, but he was secular and led a stable government. He was also sunni in a majority shia nation. When the US entered into Iraq and began indiscriminately blowing up everything and then set up a shia dominated government, the pissed off young people that just were target practice to Americans were radicalized by Al-Qaeda, and began to hate the shia's for collaborating with the Americans. The former Al-Qaeda In Iraq would rebrand itself and enter into Syria. Before America knew what ISIS would become, they funded it to take down Assad. This blew up in their face, and the rest is history. Not saying what they are doing is right, but America is certainly as fuck not innocent.   Also, name checks out, why are you supporting a goon for president   What do you mean, I dont see much of the IDF in any jail cells  	7
 VERRRY GOOOD   It's like pharis hat fuckd the joker!  Also chester's jacket makes zero noise....   Bonewheel skeletons and Bed of Chaos for obvious reasons. Also I have a problem USING homing soul mass.  I wish it 'homed' better.  If I'm facing two enemies with varying health, I wish it sent one, then two etc to kill first enemy, then used the remaining mass to kill second enemy, as opposed to sending all to enemy that is closest.  But I guess that how's 'homing missiles' work.  I also wished Dragon's Breath sent enemies flying like gravelord souldance.  I mean it's 50 INT and kind of a pain in the ass to get it should do more than it does.   Also I hope in DS2 that if I'm locked on an enemy and they fall off a cliff, I lose my lock on them as soon as they are in the point of no return on the cliff edge.       Female, White/Silver hair, Crown of Dusk, Arotrias armor, and an Obsidian Sword 2 handed (moonlight great sword also acceptable)   Do it! See how hard it is for us guys to be in this position!

 I'll just drive.   The state graph was to show that STATEWIDE public transportation usage is only about 300k. The Boston graph shows 1/3 of approx 300k daily commuters use public transport (ie. approx 100K). There are about 3 million commuters in the state. The point being that arguments about Millions or even 500K commuters using the MBTA are completely false. If people want to raise the gas tax to pay for the MBTA instead of raising fares, it is pretty relevant that 80% of state commuters drive and far less than 10% use the T. $2.10 to ride from Braintree to Alewife or Oak Grove plus a bus transfer is a pretty outragious deal.   Oh well, there are still zipcar, cabs, Uber, and bikes right?   I know right? Too funny.      Wow, the legal system moves swiftly in Korea.   I bet they give up...   Those numbers are massively overstated because (from the MBTA)  Unlinked trips are the number of passengers who board public transportation vehicles. Passengers are counted each time they board vehicles no matter how many vehicles they use to travel from their origin to their destination.  Bus and subway ridership is estimated based on CharlieCard or CharlieTicket or cash transactions on MBTA fareboxes and fare gates. We then adjust for customers who transfer within downtown subway stations or who show their passes to an inspector, or children and others who do not use the fare equipment.). The adjustment is calculated from statistics from studies and inperson ridership counts. Currently, farebox and fare gate information is not 100% real time. It is not immediately available at the end of the month. However, the MBTAs goal is to develop daily real time counts in the future   In reality only about 300K people use the ANY FORM OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION for commuting in Massachusetts. http://i.imgur.com/5Mkdl4f.png http://i.imgur.com/8j3jG0O.png UNDENIABLE 100% TRUTH: MBTA riders make up a tiny percentage of the state's daily commuters    Unlinked trips are the number of passengers who board public transportation vehicles.

It is not immediately available at the end of the month. However, the MBTAs goal is to develop daily real time counts in the future  I'm directly quoting the MBTA, if they mean each time someone pays a fare it certainly doesn't sound like it. Like I said above, the FEDs say only 300k people commute using public transpo in the whole state.     this is my favorite reddit comment ever   Or invest in a fare-by-distance program.   1% sales tax increase in Suffolk County dedicated solely to the MBTA, 20% fare hike, MBTA shifted to 401k from pension system. Fare-by-distance program. $5,000 dollar fine for fare jumping.   They get paid well. You need to be a resident of the city to have any chance of getting hired. You then will take a test and be ranked by your score (it is very easy). Disabled veterans and veterans will be ranked above you. The list is very long and there are A LOT of disabled vets and vets so if you don't meet those criteria your chances are slim to none.   wrong   Huh, that's funny, I've done it many times.   it's probably counting each ride ie. you get on the green-line, transfer to red, and then take that same way home = 4 "riders"   Good on them for actually getting some training and practicing. Just buying a gun for security and not learning to properly employ it is not a wise decision. If you're female and looking to shoot I would try to find reviews of ranges/trainers from female shooters. Some trainers can be kind of patronizing to female shooters and steer them towards ineffective firearms and may focus more on flirting than actually training.   They should start crowd funding to test them. Maybe make a website where they post convictions that result from their donations.   I don't think standard protocol involves turning over your weapons to a rebel militia.   This isn't about facts anymore. It's about feelings.    12 million is less than 1% of the MBTAs budget and our state has a 700 million dollar shortfall.    they are wrong  Those numbers are massively overstated because (from the MBTA): Unlinked trips are the number of passengers who board public transportation vehicles. Passengers are counted each time they board vehicles no matter how many vehicles they use to travel from their origin to their destination.

No congestion on the T? Have you ever used the T? More riders means more trains which means more wear and tear. If the 100,000 daily Boston MBTA riders were joined by the 130,000 daily Boston drivers it would destroy the system much more severely than a few storms. The only about 1/3 of MBTA service (excluding debt costs) is covered by fares. There is no reason to assume increased fare receipts would outweigh increased costs associated with more ridership.    Egypt, Syria, Libya, Yemen. Remember when everyone was cheering about the Arab Spring?   20 cents? Oh gee golly, that would buy you about 500 million.   who the fuck is scott baker?   It is give and take, but the fact is that the vast majority of people in Massachusetts commute by car, even the majority of people commuting into Boston. Saying "We're gonna raise taxes on 80% of commuters to pay for a service 4% of commuters use" is not the way to get things done.   My point was that if you're going to try to sell a revenue program, tying the people who pay for it with the people who benefit is the greatest recipe for success. The repeal may not have won out west, but the index was sold as paying for bridges and highways, not the MBTA.    My point was that you cannot say "the T helps drivers by reducing congestion on the roads" without conceding that drivers help the MBTA by reducing congestion on the T. My point about MBTA fares was that raising the gas tax solely to pay for the MBTA would be just as unpalatable for drivers, as raising fares and using the funds to solely pay for roads would be to MBTA riders. Indexing the gas tax would save about a max of 100 mil a year (not all of which would go to the MBTA by the way), whereas my proposal of 1% income tax earmark and 20% fare increase would raise about 300 mil. It would also actually come from the people using the service. Never mind getting the spending on pensions and salary under control. Interestingly, payments for materials, supplies and service rise at 6.3% annually while pensions rise at 8.2% and wages rise at 14.2%.   If you think T shutting down for a few days during the worst snowfall in recorded history is going to destroy the state's economy you need to calm down. If you want to tie tolls to the region served, fine by me, but don't think you are going to fix the T's problems with the gas tax price indexing. My point was that tying the revenue to the region that is actually served by the MBTA has a lot more chance of success than selling the idea of a universal tax hike.   Only about 1/3 of the MBTA's debt is from the big dig (say 130 mil a year) They take in over 800 million in revenue from the sales tax earmarks they received in exchange for this debt. Interestingly, debt service for the MBTA is falling at about 4.5% a year. Meanwhile materials, supplies and service rise at 6.3%, pensions rise at 8.2%, and wages rise at 14.2%   And people driving reduces the burden on the MBTA. Try convincing people in Pittsfield that they should pay more for the MBTA. 20% of ALL STATE SALES-TAX already goes to the the MBTA. Increasing fares and sales tax in Suffolk (and perhaps Norfolk and Middlesex) counties would put the burden on those who most benefit from the MBTA. If the state-highway system begins to fail to meet its obligations, you won't find me arguing about raising tolls, the gas tax, or sales-tax out outlying counties. Would you support raising MBTA fares to pay for highways in western mass? That's a lot what all this gas-index stuff sounds like. Besides, if the legislature wants to raise the gas tax they can do it.   Lots of blame being thrown around these days but not a whole lot of solutions. A few basic thoughts: raise sales-tax 1% in Suffolk county with a 100% earmark for the MBTA, raise fares 20%, shift the MBTA to a 401k from a pension.   It was not an exaggeration, it was a lie about a first-hand account for personal benefit. A news reporter's number one job is supposed to be truthful reporting of the news. He deliberately reported something that HE KNEW TO BE FALSE. Why are you defending him?   Beverly Scott is doing everything she possibly can, Baker said  He wants to reduce the MBTA budget because of the 700 million dollar state budget deficit. He wants to cut 14 million (or less than 1%) of the 1,932 million MBTA budget.   Still sore huh?    I believe her too, but she doesn't report to Baker.    she's trying to save her job   wrong here's a picture of a terrorist killed in an airstrike NSWF obviously  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Musab_al-Zarqawi#mediaviewer/File:Zarqawi_dead_us_govt_photo.jpg   But all these numbers really tell us is that more people are using marijuana at some point in the days or weeks before they drive. With legalization fully underway in several states, there's nothing surprising about this.   they don't have an effective measure of "highness" so this study is meaningless. No shit someone who smoked two weeks ago is less dangerous than someone who pounded 10 beers 5 minutes ago. To imply that somehow driving while high is less of an impairment than driving while drunk is irresponsible at best.   raise sales-tax 1% in suffolk county with a 100% earmark for the MBTA, raise fares 20%, shift the MBTA to a 401k from a pension   You'll never have to wonder if you made a difference for the rest of your life.   I think they should just increase MBTA fares   I LOL'd   maybe? http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=9a2_1423433645   not capitalism, over-regulation   Is "cunt" a work no one can say now?

That appears to be a rather large distinction   they've seen what left-wing ideology taken to the extreme gets you   You're 100% right   I kinda like this guy   Damn, that reporter is scared shitless. I don't blame him.   In time of war the USA allows the same, after conviction via court-martial   Pharrell has aged really well   Damn that kid is brave to go in there.   It's just an unfortunate truth. It isn't to say that war and rape and the resulting PTSD aren't real (they are and impact TONS of people) but it seems as though the more publicity seeking the "victim" is, the more likely it all turns out to be bullshit. In other words, the "squeaky wheel" is often a liar. Such people do a real disservice to the real victims.   Its the new cool thing, men lie about war for attention so they can be part of the PTSD victim class, women lie about college rape for basically the same reason.    Honest question, how is medical education financed in the UK?   Boston had 40.2 inches in the last 7 days and Worcester had  51.5, anyone know if Worcester broke its 7 day record?   As much as as I support all manner of vaccines, I can't help but think that the recent backlash will probably only reenforce the false beliefs that anti-vaxxers already have. The constant "you're stupid," "I hope your kids get sick," "you should be arrested for child abuse," bombardment most likely just hardens people's opinions. Non-judgmental education would probably be much more persuasive....but fuck this is America in the 21st century. What is something worth if you can't call people stupid on facebook.   How much should she ask for? 500 dollars?   Send them drones. We could have their operators fly them from the USA. Great for targeting artillery, as well as striking GRADs and SAM sites. They're cheap and don't contain tech that is super secret at this point. We'd lose a lot to SAMs but such is life.   Make sure to tell the Mayor and your legislative leaders as well  http://www.cityofboston.gov/contact/?id=55 https://malegislature.gov/People/Profile/RAD1 https://malegislature.gov/People/Profile/SCR0   look at all those people trying to not interact with anyone   Hep C also causes cirrhosis and is very prevalent in the junkie community   We should hand out heroin at CVS and ban naloxone. I don't know why taxpayers pay money to save the lives of junkies who we will continue to subsidize until they die of cirrhosis in their 50's.   The VAST majority of people the people prescribed opioids legally never become addicted and most addicts did not start with a legal prescription. I have had numerous opioid prescriptions in the past for injuries and surgeries. Never became addicted because I followed doctor's instructions and I'm not a weak bitch (you are correct, some people are  built differently, they're called pussies and they become addicts). I am sincerely glad every time a piece of shit junkie dies because it saves myself and other taxpayers from paying for their bullshit. Its funny, not a single person I have known in my personal life has EVER become an addict, and yet I deal with them professionally every day. If your friends end up junkies it probably reflects on you more than anything else.   Neither do I. Don't hang with white-trash townies.   Agree 100%   Absolutely not. They should assume zero responsibility for this. How about holding the fucking stupid drug addicts responsible for their own actions and not punishing the millions of people with legitimate pain that get relief through opioids every year and have no problem.   Batch cut with Fentanyl   Does it make you uncomfortable?   When I fail I don't make excuses. Perhaps your parents taught you differently.   That's not insight, those are meaningless internet credentials from some POG with a sob story and a worthless degree.   You sound like you have a lot of experience. Share with me your medical and military insight.   Never, I'm not a weak person. Many people are. Women that fuck up something and then blame their period definitely are.   Man, this professional athlete was just in that 0.001%? WOW. Now, to be serious here, I agree with you. The majority of women can function just fine on their period. That's a pretty good reason not to blame your failures ON YOUR period. It goes pretty far towards confirming, in the minds of some, negative stereotypes about women. TL:DR if you want to be thought of as an equal don't blame your failure to perform on your menstrual cycle.   In real life sometimes desk jockeys have to play soldier too. It would be better to just ban women with a history of PMS altogether.    In a test of physical strength that is pretty much universally accepted. Now apparently women are incapable of carrying out their normal duties several days of the month. Good to know.    Ure gonna require all women in the military get a shot or implant? I'd be all for that but I can't say I believe most women would.   Laws have nothing to do with it. I postulate that while if we removed the consequence for murder, there might be a small increase in homicide but most people would still restrain themselves. If everyone was supposed to self report their taxable income and there were no consequences for lying do you honestly believe there would not be massive fraud?   So if she doesn't get her pill she's not going be mission capable? No go.   If it was smoking-cessation no one would bat an eye.   If it is equal to a medical emergency (testicular torsion) or surgery (vasectomy) and happens every month wouldn't than mean that ovulating women are intrinsically weaker and less fit than men? I wouldn't want to hire/go into combat with/elect someone like that. Besides, this is after the fact. If she had said she wasn't feeling well BEFORE the match and cancelled no one would second guess her. If a man did poorly and then said afterward that he had blue balls or jock itch everyone would laugh at him.    Agree 100%   This article is framed as a woman, supported by a man, having greater freedom to pursue her passion. This is an issue, however, that isn't really related to gender at all. It is the recognition of the fact that money gives one the freedom to pursue passions that might otherwise fall the wayside. This is something that really needs to be drummed into the heads of kids these days. There is a whole lot of lip service to "Follow your dreams!!" but the reality is that many passions like sports, music, and art rarely turn into a lucrative career. When a middle class kid proclaims that they are going to be a poet, someone shouldn't tell them to pursue it at any cost, but rather encourage them and temper the encouragement with advice to develop a more conventional source of income. If someone wants to be a starving artist, good on them, but it should be made clear from the start that this is what where they are likely to end up if they follow their passion to the exclusion of all others.   In Worcester of all places! I think this has to do with overall parking availability. In places where there is always SOMEWHERE you can park so long as you shovel (ie Worcester, Rozzie(?)) space savers may have a place. In areas where parking is ALWAYS severely limited (Southie), it just privatizes a public resources and wastes everyone's time. I wonder if the culture of space savers could date to a time where the parking situation in Southie was more similar to that in Worcester.   The same could be said for our system of taxation. That said, I don't believe in space savers....BUT I don't think the only thing that keeps it in place is fear. I won't move a saver after a huge storm because I respect the effort to shovel the space out. If someone just throws it down for a dusting I'll probably move it and park there....though in that case a fear of vandalism does play a role in my decision making.    Estimates vary, I was going with a lower estimate of 1 million. Still, it should be noted that the soviets killed about 100000 civilians a year while NATO killed roughly 400 civilians a year with more troops in country (at peak) and achieving a greater degree of success. Something to remember whenever "whataboutism" rears its head.   They were/are, I was using the offensive meaning of mongoloid   Well during the soviet occupation of Afghanistan roughly 100,000 civilians were killed per year. During the following civil war period roughly 40,000 civilians were killed per year. During the NATO occupation roughly 1,400 civilians were killed per year. Of those, 1/4 were killed by NATO troops. If you were to speculate that without NATO intervention the civil war period would have continued (14X40000)-(14X1400)= you would conclude that over half of a million Afghan civilian lives were saved by NATO intervention.   Actually the NATO occupation of Afghanistan has created the most peaceful environment for civilians in Afghanistan in the last 35 years.   GI Bill   And all this bullshit couldn't stop a couple of mongoloids with a history of extremistism and some fireworks from blowing up the marathon. This shit had nothing to do with public safety and everything to do with control.   It would be nice if people just took responsibility to shovel their own shit and not fuck someone over. I spent several hours shoveling out my car in 4-5 ft drifts here in Worcester.  I did NOT leave a space saver. When I came back at the end of the day no one had taken it, but some people had shoveled out new spots for their own cars. Same thing happened again today, no space saver, no one took my spot. I figured pay it forward and shoveled out another space.   It only snows in Boston a dozen or so times a year. Africans slaughter each other every day.   The funny thing is that in this case the retards that refuse to listen to science are generally a bunch of liberal hippy types.......evolution and climate change on the other hand...bunch of bible nuts. Just shows that most people are morons in their own special way. (not me of course, I'm the exception)   I figured out that tweezers fit an outlet at about 2. Lesson learned. OP should remove the guards so his kid can learn.   Somebody's GF banged an army guy....   There is a TV show about the women at Bletchley Park on netflix http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bletchley_Circle   Yup, Boston spends more per pupil than Wellesley, Lexington, or Brookline. The truth is that SES and racial educational outcome gaps will never go away until the parenting gap is closed. The parenting gap will never be closed because it is not politically feasible.   	104
 Shameless plug for /r/mashups. Come join the party!   Guns are probably called either Light Electron Blaster I (up close and personal) or 75mm Gatling Rail I (further away). The repair module is probably the Small Armor Repairer I.   What was the name of your ship?   Nope. You can make a ton of difference in fleet fight with minimal skills.    Assuming new character, it takes way more than 2 months (66 days) for something simple like this: https://zkillboard.com/kill/42580382/ . That's not including required fitting skills like PWG/Cap managment (or jury rigging skills), and all level 4 on everything related excluding weapon upgrades.   Not me, if you look close enough you can see I said 'near' perfect skills. At least in solo pvp if you want to even try to win the majority of fights, you should have at least all level 4 on the related skills. Of course you can still be really annoying with EWAR at a low skill level, but something like DPS you need good skills or you'll feel useless.   Stay classy boys. *tip*.   I completely agree, but you have to understand too that even getting near perfect frigate + small weapon skills takes what, a couple of months? Which is nothing to us but huge to people that have played completely different MMO's like WoW.   Not very feasable. There are ways to do it, but its quickly going to turn into a job, and is probably an easy way to get burnt out. Sharing money from invites is probably referring to the 21 day trial invite. The inviter gets a PLEX which is worth approximately 930mill isk, as long as you actually upgrade your trial into a full account. If you do this with someone you trust they can split the $$$ with you.   http://store.markeedragon.com/catalog/EVE_Online_30_Day_Free_Trial_Code.html You can get a 30 day trial if you don't wish to get the ISK.   Yeah, if you have the money buying a character is definately worth it.   I pay that because of how much entertainment I get out of it. Lots of fun, and a great community.   https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2n18op/this_is_eve_uncensored_2014_new_trailer_uses/cm9iixv This dude explains it nicely.   When warping from system to system (BRAVE Corp.), they got caught in a warp disruption bubble that stops their warp and traps them inside the bubble, stopping them from warping off. As soon as this happened Rooks and Kings used the most expensive ship in the game (titan) to teleport themselves into that bubble. Rooks and Kings were in specially tanked, AOE damage dealing ships. So essentially it's like a group of people walking into an ambush and then throwing molotov cocktails on their faces. Really effective, hard to pull off.  Edit: I take too long to respond apparently!   Bought Far Cry 4 when the reviews came out, and now my game won't save. Can someone please test my save to see if it works on your machine (make sure you make a backup of your own save first)? Please only test it on a retail copy.   Cheers for any help. Here's the save file: http://speedy.sh/EJZw4/Save001.sav      Another stupid question, can't some copyright troll just signup for a private tracker and then get the IP's of the peers? I guess that's where using a VPN comes into play?  Edit: Sorry this question was answered below, didn't see it.   Okay, thank you!   Any idea if the London one is getting posted today?

It's 11:30PM here, just a heads up, probably won't get it till tommorow.   This guy seems worse than aura ikko.   On the plus side their website is really nice.   That videos amazing, and convinced he's better than Kanye West.   That fucking giggling in the background. 10/10.   I mean publicity = money in this case. He's stated in the past that he lives off ad revenue from Youtube, and you can't deny that this would bring him a lot of it.   I caught the video pretty early, and there were not many comments. I saw someone posted a VOD, refreshed a minute later and the comments were gone.   I think that's just what Athene heard, it's very possible this dude just abused the exploit in the Jade Forest.   Yeah. This is a troll, but he usually dosen't disable comments when someone points this out.   Yeah it was meant as a joke, but good advice none the less.   Lucky as fuck! I envy you! .__.   I guess if you don't care about potentially getting a cease and desist letter it's also okay (https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/2lptdi/anyone_got_a_cease_and_desist_letter_from_using_a/clxe4w8).   He meant public trackers, versus private trackers (ones that require invites).   The large majority of people will never have a problem with public trackers. There have been and will be incidents, however, of people recieving cease and desist letters from their ISP, or even being sued because they downloaded something.    He's talking about public trackers vs private trackers.   Might want to look at this before deciding on IPT: https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/2m3yri/longtime_ipt_usernever_looked_into_anything/   I know there are VPN's you can get with BTC/throwaway credit card that don't log info like that. I imagine there must be a seedbox with similar policys (given what they're generally used for...).   Apparently IPT is one of the few private trackers that people have recieved C D letters from (see https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/2lptdi/anyone_got_a_cease_and_desist_letter_from_using_a/ ) Also might want to stay away from IPT in general because of this: https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/2m3yri/longtime_ipt_usernever_looked_into_anything/ .  Unrelated but i've heard from a few places that IPT is actually pretty easy to get into. Can't say though because i've never actually tried...   Yeah I agree, would suck if they just took that, but I feel like Valves enough of a good guy greg that they wouldn't, especially in the internet age.   Strange, elbititz.net isn't showing for me. Just a completely white, empty page.   https://imgur.com/gallery/yU9EM   Wouldn't he only be able to copyright the ruls/design (because it's valves IP, TF2 i.e.)?

Sounds about right: http://en.seoi.net/sokumen/?n=GEEMU   is...is that even possible?   Fake as fuck but still hilarious.   What's that ship?   Wondering if anyones got a c d letter from their ISP regarding something they've downloaded/uplodaded on a private tracker... I've heard a few stories of people getting them on public trackers but never private.   How come that SS says the blueprints are originals and zkill says they're copies? https://zkillboard.com/kill/42187062/   Damn dude that battlecruiser warping around looks awesome.   Love it.

I thought the button bound to crash TF2 was 'connect to server'?    I mean game development as in actually programming and designing games.    Any tip sfor getting into game dev? Cheers   I completely agree. OP could have used reworking the title, and maybe saying upfront that it was a competition between friends.   Huh, I wonder what happened in that thread then? Or maybe you'd call that something other than elitism?   Thank you for being calm and level headed... it's much needed in this thread.   Sure, and I wonder if it's possible to have a friendly discussion as opossed to the rampant elitism and vitriolic comments like in that thread. It's really quite saddening. I personally love chilli, and I think i'll have to make my way down to texas some day because over the pond we don't have nearly as much a following for it!   Unfortunately i'd be suprised if this dosen't discourage people quite a lot. I'm curious if this is a common problem in this sub?   On top of that, there's the people who upvote them, bringing their virulent comments to the top.    Hey,  My apologies in advance if this is in bad etiquette, i'm not sure what the rule is regarding meta/self posts on this sub.   I don't really frequent this sub, but after looking through the comments of http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/2k30b0/i_cant_stop_winning_chili_cookoffs/ this post I can't really say that I will now, or understand why anyone else does.  I understand people are passionate about what they love, whether that be chilli or food in general, but there's really no need for the amount of pure vitriol and hatred in that thread. The OP came here to share their love for food, and it's really disgusting that people feel the need to post/upvote (gross 46 upvotes) shit like this:   Jesus fucking christ. This is almost as bad as that retard last week who posted cheetos and beef jerky as snacks to go with wine. Sonnn. Recipe for award winning chili: grab a can of everything from the Hispanic shelf at Walmart. Dump in crockpot. Eat with fritos.  and this (gross 15 upvotes)  That looks fucking disgusting. Also, it's not chili, it's "Kentucky Bean and Corn Surprise."  These are only two examples of the purely malicious comments that were posted in that thread. How can you expect people to share in your passion if you try to bully them into accepting your opinion?  If this gets removed because meta/self posts aren't allowed then my only hope is for the mods to take this into consideration.  If it dosen't, then please, think before you type. There's people behind the computer screens, and damn good  way to share your passion for something, and maybe change their opinion, is to be friendly about it, and to teach them like their your friend, not the enemy.  Cheers.   Assuming that's the case I don't disagree. And I can completely understand how they might have intended that post to classify this as an exploit, but taking that rule with no context (which shouldn't have to be provided, it should speak for itself), it's ambiguous. I don't think arguing this is going to change anything, however. I understand your point, and if you're right CCP will reimburse the person and maybe banhammer the offenders. Good talk.   before it was declared an exploit.  If you're referring to the CCP post, it heavily implies that it's talking about lighting a cyno while the forcefield is already online. I agree it's an exploit (at **best** a clever use of game mechanics) but i'm just not so sure it's *official*.   This brings back strange memories of the Camel ATXI raffle... Although I guess if EN24 scammed people then that would mean people wouldn't trust their stories?    If I understand your post correctly people knew about lighting a cyno then putting up the forcefield 6 years ago and took that post as saying that was an exploit? Or did people know that they could light one inside an already lit forcefield, as the post implies? Apologies for my ignorance, but I wasn't around for this exploit.  Still, your below post right, it's stupid to even walk on the thin line, whatever CCP's stance. Hopefully this will provoke a statement from them.   That post heavily implies you shouldn't be able to light a cyno inside an *already up* field (as opposed to lighting a cyno, then putting up the field), although it does not explicitly state that. Seems to me CCP need's to put out another, clearer, statement on whether this is allowed. After all this is 6 years later too.   Pretty simple cause and effect.

 Right. Remember that when the lawsuits fly. Personally, I have no problem w gay marriage but it will be a one way street later.    I don't think the state should be involved in anyone's marriage. No special benefits should be doled out by the state.    I guarantee you people will begin suing churches for discrimination. Some whacky courts will uphold it.    Will you be as passionate in your defense of those churches that choose not to marry gay couples because they feel it impinges on their religious mandate? If so I think both sides win here.

The Fed can't carry Obama's  water forever.    As bat-shit insane as he drives the left I will happily get as many jobs as needed to  help him secure the office of the Presidency.    Holy shit! As bat-shit insane as he drives the left I will happily get as many jobs as needed to  help him secure the office of the Presidency.    About 2.5 Tbsp of blood.    Pakistan is countered by India and isn't openly aggressive toward the US. They even claim to be allies.   Israel is no threat to the US.   However, we are actively engaging Iran who repeatedly state that they want to annihilate the great Satan in talks to give them the bomb.   DURRRRRRRRRRFF   Sure. What's the worst that could happen in giving an atomic bomb to people who openly call for your death? I say we roll the dice!    Oy vey! The middle guy with the goofy head and jaw thrusting and the other guys staring longingly into each other's eyes.    No surprise. There will always be evil fucks in the world.    1. Westboro Baptist doesn't run the fucking country.   2. Westboro Baptist isn't about to be handed the bomb to consolidate power in the middle east and slay the infidels.    They're still waiting too. Long time wait.    Just 10 million? Can we up that number?    Why not share your notes with Reddit? Not intimate enough?    Of course yes, death to America" was the exact quote.    The word "willies" freaks me out.    You should Facebook your sex life.   What's your name?    Why not discuss with mom too?   Why not Dad?    You could try talking about it with someone you're fucking.    Of course yes, death to America"            Seems like the more low rent housing the better for Austinites!   You should get that on a ballot!   "Austin! The low rent capital of the world! "   So we should only isolate the poor of all colors to the Eastside.   Gotcha.    Right on! One of these scientists hit me with their car last week and told me that you can get a good look at a t-bone by sticking your head up a bull's ass, but wouldn't you rather just take the butcher's word for it?    Nightmares.    Maybe they should designate ALL of the Eastside as Section 8 housing. There are a ton of people living here that really can't afford the pricing.   That'll make people want to live in Austin.  Problem solved.   That's still not going to solve the poor white people problem though.    Beginning at what income range?    "Free"    I'd love to hear your solution to the problem.    I assume you're talking about the sticker that says white people and not my comment.    Yeah! We need some Ferguson fires up in here!   /s   Like what? Maybe ban white people?    I believe you're forgetting the Don Lemmon black hole theory.

One thing is clear. That little white dude wasn't trying to highjack a plane.    I'm sure that the SGA murders were still fresh in people's minds once the technology rolled around a mere 10 years later to enable the Moon towers.       Nice human suit you have on.       You know. For research!    What a fascist wingnut.   We're talking about handing Iran the bomb, right?    That's why you stock up on ammo.    911 was an inside hand job.    South by South blast!   Question from someone who doesn't know how colorization works. How do you know what color everything should be?    That jacket is gray, not black.    Srry to hear that, man.    You effectively eliminate all of the tax attorneys, bean counters, etc. No write-offs for anyone. Your percent is auto-deducted from your check.    Flat tax. Or fair tax. Neither requires an IRS.    How long have you been sober?    They sound ridiculously liberal.   Or just liberal in a college setting.    Yeah, I don't honestly care that much but also don't want people to off themselves. Oh well, I guess they're on their own!    No one will question DeNiro or Christian Bale for sacrificing for their craft.

Sometimes you just lose your job! LOL!    Yeah, but now they are arguing amongst themselves about whether or not we can be trusted. This combined with Netanyahu's praise of the Obama admin doing more than will ever be known with the Israelis behind the scenes is more than enough to undermine that shit deal.   Thank God.

It's a different game from college to pro especially at QB, so volatility should be expected.    Quinn and Russel sold jerseys and generated ticket sales and increased team interest.  They returned their investment and then some I'm guessing.    A plagiarized one?

 I'm on mac but found the folder. Unfortunately, the adding them back and having to select the download destination for all of them was what I was hoping to avoid as I have 1000+ torrents across 4 different hard drives. Oh well, lesson learned.     Sorry should have specified. On mac, didn't have that option checked (which sucks), but I found the equivalent folder and at least all of the torrents files are there.    No, just the torrents, but now I have manually add back 1000 torrents across like 4 different hard drives... not a happy camper right now.    Sometimes I need to stop all my torrents so I will select all and hit the stop button up top... except this time, while sleep deprived at 4:30 AM in the morning, I accidentally hit the remove button besides it and thus removing ALL of my completed/seeding torrents. Is there an undo function or cache somewhere of these torrents? I literally had 1,000+ torrents and will not be feasible for me to go individually download all of the .torrent files over again.   Thanks in advance for any advice!    I'm going to try my darnest to finish my stupid work Sunday morning so I can be there at 2.   Sorry it wasn't when I originally loaded the page. Will delete.

I'm so glad that she's finally get the recognition she deserves. I've been defending her for years by pointing out she's classically trained and showing people her NYU vid. But now with the Tony Bennett collaboration and this highly visible Oscar performance, I think more and more people will finally realize exactly how talented she is as a musician.      She recently released one with Tony Bennett: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek_to_Cheek_%28album%29   Completely agree with you. Jake's been on a roll lately: Prisoners, Enemies, and now Nightcrawler. I think we're going to see great things to come.    And for anyone else interested in some more of Lady Gaga's less mainstream material :)    * Bang Bang: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-huNrHAou-E  * Anything Goes (w/ Tony Bennett): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg1meK-IgOM  * NYU Talent Competition: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NM51qOpwcIM     For anyone else interested in some more of Lady Gaga's less mainstream material :)    * Bang Bang: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-huNrHAou-E  * Anything Goes (w/ Tony Bennett): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg1meK-IgOM  * NYU Talent Competition: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NM51qOpwcIM     Pawel Pawlikowski was a just a boss at denying that playoff music.

So sweet. Wes Anderson is definitely deserving of an Oscar though.    Grand Budapest not winning original screenplay (or directing). :(   Wes Anderson really deserves an Oscar. His entire crew who won awards and thanking him all night was really sweet.    Neil Patrick Harris did an awesome job with the Oscar opening number, but I still think his best one was from the 2011 Tony's: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6S5caRGpK4   As an added bonus, that was the same show he did this duet with Hugh Jackman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJxyuTMMog      I'm so glad that she's finally get the recognition she deserves.

I thought I hated gingham, but after going through your inspo album, I've just realized it can work in so many different ways. Thanks for the post!    Yes! This was the one I was looking for. I'm going to make sure to save it this time around so I can always remember the Raleigh Snowpocalypse of 2014 fondly.    Which comic is your description from?    Does anyone have the AT-AT shop of this pic?    The show might only last 3 more seasons, but it'll take George another decade to finish the book series no doubt.    This pretty much confirms I can't watch anymore of the TV show for the next decade or so and I have to unsub from /r/gameofthrones.     Sigh, if only.    Sorry don't have the day off either. :/    In no particular order:   * C T Wok (Morrisville) * Banana Leaf (Cary)  * Super Wok (Cary)  * Grand Asia (Hot Bar) (Cary)  * Shanghai (Durham)    Those are two completely different places with the same name. The one in Cary is authenic Sichuan food and the one in CH is just a Chinese buffet (or at least was the one time I went there a few years ago).    Hey! 25/F here also. Love eating, drinking, movies/tv, shows (theater/musicals) and general adventures. Seems like there are quite of few of us in this thread - would you be interested in organizing something for all of us to meet up and grab food or drinks? I can't do this weekend, but will be available the following weekend. Otherwise, feel free to hit me up.       I'll be there in a few.    There was an eBay like this one on Black Friday. I saw it when I was buying my PS4.    I'll be there.    YISSSS. Now we just need a timeline and which areas are getting it first.    You could try setting something up for a different night too.    I totally misread this as "The Martian Chronicles" (by Ray Bradbury). Also amazing btw - you should check it out.    What a shame... I consider Mozart to be one of my composers of all time and his body of work, even in his short life, is amazing. I think it would have been fascinating to see how similar or different the works between the two siblings would have been.    Just came here to echo all the other comments - my absolute favorite book of all time. There's just nothing quite like an epic tale of revenge spanning decades in the making.    It's awesome that he's working out in his SHIELD swag. Guess he's really using that method acting.    Anyone know where to watch the French version of this show? I'm really interested in seeing the original after watching this.   EDIT link here: http://full-stream.net/5920-19-2-saison-2.html   FYI the French scene is literally 100% the same tracking shot wise (and even shot in the same school). There are some minor differences in terms of acting and timing. The French version seems to close the shot a little better (dialogue wise), again the shot is the same.    Also this picture here, confirmation with proof: pic.twitter.com/lUSHtpDfmc   My favorite numbers so far (titles are just made up by me):   * Galavant Main Theme (Ep 1)   * Hero's Journey (Ep 2)  * Together (Ep 4)  * Maybe You're Not the Worst Thing (Ep 4)     Stop with the pointless remakes of good British shows. (I'm looking at you Gracepoint.)    Holy shit this cast is amazing!   Grace's Cafe on Duke campus also has a pretty good bubble tea, but I don't believe there are any stand alone bubble tea places in this area.    I made sure I didn't have any other plans or commitments tonight for this.    Great article - well written and well researched.    Sounds good. Probably won't be there at 2, but expect me sometime around 2:30.    Yes! That would be awesome. :)    Way too much was cut and the movie looses so much in terms of tone and theme of the original musical. The worse offense being both the act 1 ending number "Ever After" and the act 2 opening number "Once Upon a Time...Later" which is the entire premise of the story as being what happens after the typical "fairy tale" ending. Also, unnecessary change on the death of the Baker's Wife.   I would really recommend people see another version of this, whether it be live on stage or the recorded version of the original stage production. This is one of my favorite musicals, but so many of the best songs are cut in the movie and it looses so much of it's humor and story in the process.   Such a shame. Rob Marshall did an excellent job with Chicago... what happened here?   That 2nd photo is 100% pure Dorian.    Ha, I did my romance research before I picked a gender. Dorian's the reason I went male.   Ah ok - awesome. I was starting to worry a little bit.       I'll be there - just let me know when you guys decide to start.    Can't really help with your question (other than maybe it's fabric) but I did want to give you kudos on your excellent paint drawings - they made me chuckle.   Ditto here. I used to live about a mile away from my elementary school and I walked home from school most days starting when I was in 3rd grade. This was only roughly 10 years ago. Cops really just have nothing better to do these days.   What do they plan to do with the entire space? I remember hearing something about a park, but 308 acres is a lot.    Completely agree. This is why I've given up on award shows a long time ago. I mean like Bradley Cooper and all, but he doesn't hold a candle to Jake Gyllenhaal in Nightcrawler. Or really Jake Gyllenhaal on any day.    Wow, is this for every performance?   EDIT: it is!    For dancing, Architect (top 40s with some random older stuff thrown in) and Zinda's (EDM/house) are really your two best options in downtown Raleigh.    Still a good deal as long as you don't hate tofu.    How much did this all cost?   Yup, that was my point exactly.   BUT The Interview wasn't planned as a VoD release either... so maybe studios would be willing to approve a smaller budget film with a targeted VoD release. In my opinion, not every film demands a moving theater going experience (especially with the prices of tickets these days), but for smaller films or dramas will little action that necessitates a big screen viewing, this could be a great way to capture revenue from people who might otherwise just pirate it or watch it TV or rent it later.    All the movies here are great recs - I just want to add two more: Incendies (by the same director as Prisoners and Enemy) and The Drop.    This is impressive considering how unplanned the VOD release was. However, you have to temper that with the fact that this movie had HUGE publicity proceeding it, beyond what they planned on marketing so at the end of the day, this will still be a bit of an anomaly.   Still, it will be interesting to see if Hollywood decides to use this as a case study and attempt to do more VOD related releases (whether it be stand alone or simultaneous with a big screen release).    The /r/trianglegamers group meets in Morrisville if you want to give it a shot - we're actually looking for some new people as a few people moved away recently. We start Sundays around 5 - come check it out! I've been going for over a year now and it's a great group.   The group meets in Morrisville now if you want to give it a shot - we're actually looking for some new people as a few people moved away recently. We start Sundays around 5 - come check it out! I've been going for over a year now.    I've never been to one of these Raleigh meetups, but I think I might check this one out.    I won't be back from the winter break until next weekend so I'll see you guys next week.    Any experience or comments about this process? Do they always have tickets available for day of?    Hi guys, so I've heard a lot of things are closed during this period - just wondering how bad it is. I'm visiting with my family - do we need to make reservations or probably just be able to wander about and just find a place to eat whenever we feel like breaking? I'm asking in particular about the night of Dec 24th and Dec 25th.   Also, are all places and shops closed on Dec 25th or are some things still open. Do you guys have any recommended areas for these days (aside from touristy sights like cathedrals or museums).   Thanks!    Death of a fan favorite character?    Yes, please.    I didn't get the gift card that was supposed to come with the PS4 - I ordered online though.    Is it all night or just before a certain time?          Aannd still working... might be a no show this week.    I've got a lot of work to do today, but I'll try to make it. I probably won't be there until 7 or 8 at the earliest, but I'll update this post later today with my status.    Upload to imgur and link here.    Might be interested - can you post a pic?    It's ok, I bought here: http://www.ebay.com/itm/111546676176?_trksid=p2059210.m2749.l2649 ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT   Only $20!    Ugh. Seller "relisted" at $10 more.    Can you imagine the shock if you just happened to drop in for a burger and turn around and see the entire cast of AoS sitting nonchalantly there? I'm pretty sure I would shit my pants, stare at them for a bit, squeal, and then run over to say hi.    Completely agree on It's Always Sunny - I just don't like humor/comedy that lies on stupidity. It's just sort of tragic and cringe inducing in my books. Same reason I couldn't get into Arrested Development.    Ditto - it took me 5 tries to get into Mad Men. It's still not my favorite, but once I got through the first season and a half or so, the show just really started to flow for me.    Judging from his expressions, Colbert's life is now complete.    cc me too! Thanks!    Now let's hope some of this recognition will translate to increased viewers and Bryan Fuller can complete his vision of the TV show.       I'm not quite as far as you, but I would say the first 25 hours of play was relatively fine for me as well (banter was a little lower than usual but not alarmingly so). But after I got to Skyhold, shit just started breaking. Hours 25-40 has been buggy as hell (and basically no banter now) and I've actually had to stop playing because it's so bad.    I really hope by fixing some of these audio issues, it improves the banter/bgm bugs by extension somehow.    Second this. The fifty shades of bald did not impress me.    Ditto happened to me. He confirms and nothing changes and the options reappear.    Joining the military? Psh please - I'm leading an inquisition here.    Won't make it this week.   As much as I love all of you guys... I just got a PS4 and Dragon Age Inquisition this week... see you all in roughly 150 hours or so.   This guarantees that I will watch this.     This is motherfucking AWESOME.     Completely agree on this. That's what I plan to do for my future wedding. At least that way they can get a dress of a style they want.    Wtf - Target Australia has actually pulled this game off shelves due to this?    Bridesmaid dresses are different. For some weddings, the bride is very specific about the exact dress or exact color and style of dress that she wants her bridesmaids to wear. In this situation, you are forced to buy a dress that you never wear again because of how impractical it is or if it's ugly and not really your style. These are the sacrifices you make for friendship.    I'm super excited but I'll reserve judgement until I either see gameplay or play it myself. Plus it's a little weird to see Sledgehammer making COD zombies instead of Treyarch so let's see how they do.       I love it - this is amazing!    I'll be there around 530. With soup.   Thanks! You're awesome!    Thanks! You're awesome!   	124

  awesome keep recommending sliders when you stumble across one of the many "new rider, need advice" threads. i made post to raise awareness   nope. but i'll go back and check the threads i saved   i heard that for a beginner, one day at the track improves your riding as much as six months on the road   i guess my point is i just wanted to bring this to the attention of other beginners   i should say that i've never ridden a motorcycle but am about to get one. i just don't understand how someone knows when to counter-steer at low speeds   but i don't want to be one of those people. i like living   but at what speed does counter-steering take over? say i decide to lane split and have only one direction to go (right), should i counter-steer to go right or turn the bars right? at what speed does this change?   so anything above 10 mph i should counter-steer? i don't get how someone would know if they should steer "normally" or counter-steer. say i'm lane splitting and going 10 to 15-20 mph and want to turn, which way should i turn the bars?   also at what speed does it change from normal steering to counter-steering? how would i know if i should steer right to go right, or to counter-steer before it's too late?      i also want to know if i can sit on a bike without it tipping over.    i hate deer more than any other animal.    sorry im drunk. made me chuckle to myself. didn't mean it tho i'll detele it now   did you have to wear one of those sheets that muslim women wear?

       6/10 - pretty basic looking but cute.   And having big man breasts and low testosterone is super manly and straight.   I'll have to look into that. Barnes   Noble has a great reference section I'll be able to use to do my research.  Thanks.      If four years is "entry level" what's two years?   I made it a point of not turning down interviews I got from attending on campus recruiting events close to graduation.  There were many booths for "Financial Advisers" that were open to all majors. Being open to all majors is a red flag on its own but I did research into what they actually did.  Some houses are more legit than others, but most get you to resell life insurance to family and friends.  As soon as they started asking me about my network of fam and friends I politely excused myself and walked out.   Barnes   Noble. I don't buy anything there but I like sitting in their chairs and reading magazines.  If only there were a place similar to B N that I could visit and perhaps borrow some books or magazines, take them home for a bit, or read them there, then return them at my convenience.     VII / X   It's a tough call because you're making a duck face in both pictures.   In the second photo, the larger zoom makes it harder to see your duck face but it also reveals the large urine stain on your mattress.   It's a really hard decision. Personally, I'd go with #2, as the urine stain is less embarrassing than the closeup duck face.   Physical attraction trumps emotional connection. (In most cases involving males)      Those calves...   I'm no expert on lady attire but it looks like you have nice legs and I'm assuming a nice butt - so anything that would highlight that?     Look at her legs; she definitely does some kind of sport.   I don't do English breakfast, this is Murika. It's also missing the beans. And blood pudding is gross.     On the left.  I used purple potatoes so their camouflaged.     They're those little purple potatoes with onions and rosemary.    Math is hard sometimes. Forgot that betes multiplier.       6/10 - You look older than 18. You also look like you're pretty fit but your clothing isn't complimenting that at all.  Teeth.   Solid 9. You're fit and pretty.   But 2,000 calories *is* 2,000 calories.     Low and slow. Like for 30-35 min at 225. Spice to taste.       This kind of ignorance makes my skin crawl. I had some idiot on Yelp! message me saying that the racist bar tender that wouldn't serve me wasn't racist because I'm white.   Happy to report I've only bought beer from Whole Foods.    Try steal cut oats!!! Sorry I got excited. I add blueberries and a tiny bit of cocoanut oil.   Almost everything I make has onions.   not at all.   5.5 / 10.  You'd do very well to get in shape.   You look like a young Peter Griffin. It seems like there is a handsome young man hiding under all that fat. The biggest improvement you can make is to get in shape. I can give you tips there if you need, otherwise, there are plenty of subs you can use for knowledge and motivation. Current rating: ~2/10   I have some things I do that help me maintain. 1. NEVER eat in front of TV. This robs you of the sense of satisfaction you get from food as your senses are being overwhelmed by light and sound. 2. Learn to recognize when your body is not hungry.  3. Be aware of your sugar consumption. Read food labels of things you eat and notice the addition of sugars. Taper off of sugar. It's basically poison.  	34
  Could a business even have profits of they had to pay for all of this stuff on their own?  Who knows? That means roads are paid for by businesses - but that also means Walmart wouldn't pay billions in taxes. Likely, they would still make plenty of money - but the cost might be passed to the consumer.   Even if that's not correct (and it's really really hypothetical), regular government benefits that Walmart and every other business gets, **is not called a subsidy, and defining it as such is intellectually dishonest**.   Geeze tell me about it.   I FUCKING KNOW I AM FULL SCREEN DAMMIT GOOGLE!   The problem is politics. Democrats would never propose this because Republicans would actually vote yes to it - that would make Republicans look good. Well, Democrats can't have that.  Republicans won't propose this because... well frankly, because they are stupid as balls. Why the hell don't they propose something like this?   I hate politicians, even the ones I tend to agree with.   What would happen if those employees receiving partial welfare subsidies didn't have a job at Walmart?   Answer: they would have to **receive even more subsidies from the government, costing the taxpayer more money**. I would argue Walmart is saving the taxpayer money.    Um they pay taxes, which supports roads, municipal services and everything else. It's quite a stretch to say Walmart gets 'subsidies'. Then we can say every business gets 'subsidies'. In fact, **you** get subsidies because you use the road!  Sounds absurd.   What subsidies? Are you pulling this out your ass?    1. Change laws to make this much more difficult, if not impossible to happen.  2. Lower corporate tax rate to make sure this doesn't happen.  This will increase revenue from WalMart and companies like Apple, Google, etc. At a 35% tax rate, and with laws that allow you to take money overseas easily, is there any surprise? Instead of getting 35%, we end up getting significantly less. So then what's the point of the 35% tax rate if it forces companies overseas? It is self defeating.       That's megabytes or megabits? I always forget how the capitalization works.   Well so was Lebron when he was on Miami. This year too - just his two top guys got injured.   No duh. Its just a funny comparison      In this case I probably want to sell. I'm sure the people who bought yesterday will be happy with a 30% gain. Ya maybe I'll sell if it goes down more than 5% tomorrow.   Wait so this guys posts on twitter and the stock goes up 40%?   Why does having a small group of people with concentrated wealth imply that there is a large group of poor people?  Practically speaking, they usually come together, but one doesn't imply the other. That's what I don't understand.  EDIT: Have not watched video yet.   Can someone actually explain why income/wealth inequality is bad?   I see no news at all about the company, yet it went up 38%. I bought this stock at $.34 or so. Maybe it's time to cash out. Not sure what to do.   *  *  From the bottom of [this page](http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=25 daf=9 format=pdf)    Am I better off converting conservative and then once I'm in a place where I can afford to live alone, finally going full blown orthodox?  I think that would make it much more difficult for Orthodox Rabbis to take you seriously.    Amen   The counterargument is "We need to stimulate the economy, and *spend more* on the lower class". What you said doesn't seem like a counterargument.   I say spend less, you say 'we can't pay the interest' - so what are you trying to say? Don't spend less?    Good point. Although the austerity measures on Greece is not really a function of 'trickle down' thinking - it's more of a function of "were going bankrupt, and we can't spend this money".   Whether the IMF is right or wrong, how is this any different than any economist making such a statement? Or a college, or some other group?   Money does trickle down. Just not that much. Like a user said above, much less money is injected into the economy when given to wealthy - but **some** is - just not that much.   Well not exactly. It's more about how much (or really, how little) wealth trickles down. Even when the wealthy keeps their money in a bank account, it helps the lower class in someway (banks can lend more for example).   Not saying it justifies certain policies. But saying it doesn't exist at all is simply not true. It trickles down, just not as much as some would have us think.   Well at least the karma I got for this point kinda made up for it...  I was actually surprised that was my most downvoted comment. I thought it would have been one of my conservative leaning comments.   I guess I did too good of a job - because that was the point. But I used an example that is so farfetched, that no one in their right mind should think I'm being serious. I was trying to use anti-vaxxer logic to the extreme.   I have no idea. Here is what I was responding to:  http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2x9ww2/law_requiring_california_parents_to_vaccinate/coy93br   This.   Someone link that comment from a guy who was a boy, but his psycho mom told him he was a girl. Dressed him like a girl - and he thought he was a girl until he was like 8 years old. He thought his penis would just fall off eventually.   The Legend of Zelda and Doom   My most downvoted comment? For making a joke that was making fun of anti-vaxxers. Except people couldn't tell that I was joking, and thought I was serious.    I believe that shooting people in the kidneys is good for their health. Who are you to tell me otherwise?   I downvoted that comment.   Hello, I am a recruiter from Google. We were interested in interviewing you for a managerial position. We regret to inform you that we are forced to rescind our offer. We do not believe you will fit within our culture.   Giving head? What does 'making her own decisions' even mean?   Repost from /u/maniactigwelder   I have had 2 fathers in my lifetime. My biological father and my Step-Father. My biological dad was diagnosed with skin cancer in 2003 and died in 2005 from said disease, which then absolutely crushed my mom. She then got remarried in 2009 to my step dad. In 2011 he was in a work related accident that ended with him drowning in a storm drain due to a careless driver. I was 17 at the time, and when we received the news, my mom went borderline catatonic. All she did was exist as a shell of herself, and manage to go to her job. So I had to step up and (literally) be the man of the house for her and my sister who was living at home at the time. I cooked, cleaned, and did all the housework, in tandem with finishing highschool, and working nearly full-time. Did that for nearly 2 years before she came back out of her funk, but that whole experience really prepared my for the harsh reality that is life.   It was absolutely horrendous. I'm glad. Don't fuck with my bookmarks.   I had the same problem as you. I couldn't really learn anything on my own unless it was being taught to me. However eventually, when you spend enough time learning, you will be able to learn on your own. It might just take a while.  But if you really can never figure out how to learn on your own, you are probably screwed.   There is a moment...   Reallly? Can we please make an announcement when this happens?    Umm okay that's going to far. There is a moment ...   Buy everything I could possibly want, obviously. Then in the 9th year, buy a bagillion Visa gift cards. Then declare bankruptcy when the money is due. But no one will know about my visa gift cards. Keep living the high life. Done.   People who drive the speed limit in the left lane.   **GET OUT OF THE LEFT LANE OR I WILL MURDER YOUR CHILDREN**   I love STI/WRXs. One of my favorite cars I drove was an older WRX. Have fun dude.   You wanna roll up in my Mercedes?   I own makkos, as well as others. I wanted a digital copy because I left mine at home. but thanks for the unsolicited advice.   I am on tes amud aleph now. Learning with a chabura. Going very very slow. Its a chabura of balei tshuva. Most of us weren't able to spend enough time in yeshiva. And we are all Russian.   Strawman.    a fitting theme for someone who became a billionaire by buying and selling companies.  Except he is not a billionaire. A glaring mistake in the first paragraph. Kind of sounds like a biased, butt-hurt Quinn supporter pretending to be a journalist.   Or an Obama   "Plenty of slaves for my robot colony"  And of course,  "There is a moment..."   This   Amargo went full white-girl: he couldn't even.   A little late to the game, but here it goes...  **I once was sent to the principals office in 1st grade because I was "Innapropriately using the hand dryer" in the bathroom.**  And no, it's not what you are thinking. The teacher pulled me aside after I got out of the bathroom and started yelling at me. I think maybe I was slapping the front of the dryer. Honestly I was confused the whole time. While she was yelling at me she said, "YOU HEAR THAT?" - pointing back at that bathroom - "That's what you were doing!!".   I honestly had no idea what she was talking about. And if that was the case, why didn't she go and pull the student who just came out of the bathroom.  My Mom got a phone call about it. She had no idea what to even think. We laugh about it to this day.   Ha I like that the cold hearted litvak linked this.   /u/namer98 has posted quite a few anti-orthodox articles here. Let's stop taking his post seriously.    Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.   So basically he wants Orthodox Judaism to become Conservative Judaism? So after 3000 years of tradition, Orthodox Jews will change their stances simply because a bunch of immoral liberals tell them to? I certainly hope not.   I find a lot of translations into English, but I am having trouble finding digital versions of the actual text of the Talmud. Specifically, I am looking for Tractate Makkos.    I thought not having legends was part of the joke - turns out it is just bad graph making.  LABEL YOUR DAMN CHARTS.  And thanks for the explanation. Would have never realized we were talking about 'hash'.   I don't get it.   How is this useful? Who has a resolution monitor that high?   There is a moment...   I think this is more because Cooper didn't go just to save humanity. He was also going because he hated farming - "You were good at something, and you never had a chance to use it". I think she felt he was abandoning her to pursue his dreams.   This goes well in parallel with Dr. Brand's idea to go to Dr. Edmund's planet. She says she wanted to go there because it was more likely to support life - but really she wanted to see Dr. Edmund. Same thing with Cooper. He said he was going to help save humanity - but really just wanted to do what he loved. And Muprh felt that.   There is a moment...   Jesus fucking Google it.   I think that's the definition of premature optimization.   To remind you, because you seem to have forgotten, my comment was in response to this:   You know, like the ones its always trying to manufacture for countries it attempts to apply special double standards upon?  Israel is the example. Did I compare the actions of Israel or any country to 200-300 prostitution cases? You made a classical strawman argument, and somehow at least 2 idiots agreed with you.   He lost me at 'this'   Most obvious example would be israel   Cough Israel cough   Former TGI Fridays employee here.

Oh you motherfucker   There is a moment...   Yea that's quite a stretch. The 'minute' might have relatively changed  compared to Earth's minutes - but that's really irrelevant even if that was true (which it is probably not, because they don't mention any time loss in regards to Dr. Mann's planet) - as there is no reason for TARS to change the rpm to match 'real time'.

You actually didn't answer the question.   I thought it was pronounced "youler", not "oiler". Am I wrong?   Another movie with a fantastic soundtrack   No - the cost of having 'the survival skills of boy scouts'.    Hey look another way for us to dig ourselves into debt.   Considering Harvard is sitting on the biggest endowment in the country ($36 billion), this seems like a colossal waste of money.      Calling this 'cyberpunk' is an insult to Hans Zimmer.   This was entertaining.   I was corrected, it was actually mission to mars.  But there is also a self sacrifice in red planet.   Shoot you're right, Red Planet is that one with Val Kilmer and the matrix girl.    I feel like Gravity coming out a year earlier was bad for Interstellar, honestly. It looked like 'another space film' so people were maybe less interested. I've met a lot of people who saw Gravity but not Interstellar. Just unfortunate really.  Before I saw this movie - that's also what I thought. I barely read any reviews. I just heard that it was a good movie. I was shocked by how *good* Interstellar actually was. That'd be very sad if someone saw Gravity and not Interstellar. Gravity is a joke compared to Interstellar.   I really missed out huh. I wonder if they'll ever air it again in IMAX.   I think the biggest thing is not just the lack of winners, but the lack of depth to Nadal's forehand. You see anytime Nadal hit the ball slightly short, Djokavic would move and play the net (very well I might add). I think if Nadal fixes that up, and gets his confidence back, he can easily win next year.   Never go full retard   Lol no are you kidding? I saw him post this for the 18th time yesterday. I was wondering if that's a number he pulled out of his hat, but he is actually counting. The point is:  **MAKE A FUCKING STICKY ALREADY**    Orbital velocities are a significant fraction of c near the event horizon. Coupled with time dilation even more intense than on Miller's world, Endurance's flyby lasted minutes for the crew.  It is my understanding that supermassive black holes are *light years* wide. Some are thousands of light years wide. So it would have taken them *years*, even at near speed of light.   Ooh interesting. Never thought of that.    Just some observations/questions  I have about the movie (and no, I won't ask how it's possible that the future humans can... )  1. **The music might be the best part of the movie**. I mean really, it's phenominal. I've been listening to it at work. I highly suggest listening to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBfk37Fa3H0) from beginning to end. It will make you appreciate the movie even more.  2. **Doyle killed himself**. He could have easily ran into the ranger after Case went to get Dr. Brand. It's really his own damn fault for dying. He waited too long, and then took an extra glance at the wave before dying.  3. **What happened to the spaghetti effect?** So I've read that larger black holes might not have this effect - *but if it is a supermassive black hole, then they wouldn't have been able to 'slingshot' around it - that would have taken years*. Maybe I'm missing something. Either the spaghetti effect should have happened, or they should not have been able to slingshot around the black hole  4. **Murph's reaction to seeing her father**. I get that she was a peace, and old, and didn't need closure anymore. However, I would think she would ask the questions, "Hey Dad, how did you send a message across space and time? And how did you figure out the gravity problem? And where have you been? Why aren't you with Dr. Brand?"  5. **Dr. Brand's poem - Rage against the dying of the light**. I found it interesting that both Dr. Brand (sr.) and Dr. Mann seemed to really liked this poem. The poem seemed to be about fighting against 'the dying of the light' - or the extermination of the humans. Ironically, they are the two characters in the movie that actually *gave up* on plan A - saving the humans. Instead, they *give up*, and opt for just continuing the race - but not saving the people. It seems that *they both did not 'rage against the dying of the light', despite their love for that poem*.  6. **The very cliche "man sacrifices himself to save woman in space"** - I can think of two other times I've seen this in movies. In Red Planet, one character opens his helmet, so his wife doesn't die trying to save him (Tim Robbins). In Gravity, George Clooney cuts the cord in order to save the woman (Sandra Bullock). And here, Cooper detaches to save Dr. Brand. Cliche? Sexist a bit? Doesn't bother me much, just thought about it.  7. **If this movie was released earlier, it probably would have been named 'Gravity'**. Well I'm not sure, but it's a possibility.   From the /u/the_hiding answer:   It's essentially, for whatever reason, definite to happen  That is literally the definition of the Predestination Paradox - which is not really a paradox at all. But that's what it's called. We need to make a sticky on this subreddit explaining this.    But in the end it's all irrelevant. Once he's done in the Tesseract, "they" can put Cooper back into our spacetime wherever and whenever they choose.  COOPER: They have access to infinite time and space...  In the end "they" decided to put him back within range of Cooper Station at around the same time that Brand was arriving at Edmunds' world.  This.   Will people stop saying it's the bootstrap paradox? It's not. It is a [predestination paradox] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination_paradox) - which is not actually a paradox.  	113
                                                                                                          Nate Silver shows us why Megan McArdle is likely to maintain her perfect record of being wrong 100% of the time.                           @Righteousbros--Hmm, too bad. I frequently upvoted his posts. I wonder where to go from here?       @two_xjs-- why was wang_banger banned?                              Is it Opposite Day or are we on Planet Bizarro?                  @12Monkeys--Your recommendation to call 911 also presupposes certain behaviors from both parties.      You're saying that black people are apes?   @12Monkies--Don't you think if Martin had attempted to use his cell phone to call 911 after he confronted Zimmerman and asked him why he was following him, he would have ended up just as dead? Zimmerman would just have said he had to shoot him because he thought the cell phone was a weapon and he feared for his life.   That should read " brother," not "bother." Must've been a Freudian slip.                                                                                                                                                                                    European companies on board, American ones not so much.                             	136
 I'm still on my way to realizing my dream now and i will appreciate you for sharing your experience with me and give me some inspiration.    Yes! You're right! I love her, too!    I really enjoy these photos and I appreciate your sharing.    One flower girl once got the chance to get language training and later become an elegant lady.    Glad to see some of the movies I like are on the list like The Fair Lady and Forrest Gump.    Seems like if you were the superman, you would be very busy.    OK, i see. :)   What does your step 3 mean?   Yeah, it's reasonable. More robots will make our life easier and since making things is faster cheaper, people won't have so much pressure as they have now. Automation will do good to our society in some aspects. But don't you think it will also have some side effects?    But if there are robots every where to do things for human, or when the things being done by human become being done by robots or other automatic machines, the unemployment rate will rise. what are the things for human beings to do?    Superman, Batman, Captain American, these are all the heroes in the movies. if you become one of them one day, what will you do?    It seems like the reasonable analysis. So you are for the idea of making as many robots as possible to help us in our life?    Taking over the world may seem cool, but I don't think it will be fun. From the perspective of human beings, you have so many responsibilities and you should consider so many things for human beings, too. But I believe you will be the machine king one day. Try to make machines that will help us at that time.    The dialogue between the father and son when they were playing the basketball in the Pursuit of Happiness.  " You got a dream, you gotta protect it." " Don't ever let somebody tell you you can't do something, not even me. "    Wow, it seems you will take a lot responsibilities on saving the world. Keep going then! :)  	15

 I think it was that the placenta didn't deliver and the maid was too inexperienced to know  this was a serious problem so before they realused Marin was unwell it was too late(septicaemia).   I hope they left a small circle at the base of their spines unpainted ...  	2
 I've always heard that when a dog turns sideways to another dog/animal, it means he is acknowledging that it is your territory, but it is still asserting itself. Apparently if you turn your back to a dog it shows submissiveness and youre more likely to be attacked. Can anyone confirm? Dog specifically?   Oooo you know what that made me think of a great one with dogs! But great input!   I read the comments to a cat video the other day and someone mentioned the cats tail between its legs, moving the way it was, means the cats pissed. What are some other good signs to know that animals give? (humans included)    Get the fuck out of there   I'd just take the seizures thank you   Name so relevant    that's all i was trying to say. I mean I dont think anyone deserves to be physically assaulted for something so petty. But rewind before the woman assaulted her, put an older, more handicap person in the other vehicle and now who's the asshole?    Deserved it by no means, means did not deserve it fyi. I can give two shits about downvotes, but seriously like the other guy said she tried stealing the spot from another handicap person. Shes a dick. If shes not a dick, she obviously shouldnt be driving if she was unaware of what was going on. I mean youre all on her side because shes the victim, but what if the person in the other car was older or more handicap? Then you'd all be bashing her. So whatever spin you'd like to take go for it, I still stand by my argument that she put herself in that situation, did she deserve it? by no means. By no means did she deserve it. Deserve it she did not. She did not deserve it. Theyre ya go, now back to watching your VHS thunderdome tapes.   Am I the only one who thinks she kinda was asking for it? I mean she straight up jacked someones spot at walmart. Thats like walking through a whore a house and being shocked when you get your junk grabbed. Deserved it by no means.   hmm... you have my attention... What was in the box?? some beanie babies?   I like this article. I own quite a few guns, from pistols to shotguns to rifles. But I also believe in some sort of system that should be in place for weapon ownership. I respect weapons, but I'm ex military and at one point I had a concealed carry license. I know the laws on weapons. I've seen the damage they can do firsthand. I am not the typical gun owner though. Like everything, the more educated you are about something, the less you're likely to abuse it ignorantly.    He's in the military now.       Anal   I used to love the guy. Then about a year back I read an article about him blocking some lawsuit from environmentalist groups against the oil industry with some bullshit excuse about jobs and keeping the industry here. Then he went did his little guest appearance on Duck Dynasty. Kinda opened up my eyes, like what the fuck is our Governor doing on Duck Dynasty?    i disagree  	16
 ik, and ill be sure to update it once further progress is made. :)   Firstly, i know thats not how heightdata works, its just a basic placeholder so i know where i will eventually put them, and build around them and not worry about elevation. And thanks for the additional tips, ill be sure to keep them in mind   Ill be sure to take a look at those videos soon, but for the moment i added some mountains/hills that are actually in ireland, its not pretty, but it will do the job  http://imgur.com/Vi3g66d   So i have added some new ideas to my map (it is still just a drawing that i have moved from paint into paint.net to allow me to have more freedom to do assorted things) First, some 'story' about parts of the map. the northern most city, "North City" has a tall wall going around the surrounding area. Players will need special clothes in order to survive the radiation of north city for more than a minute. North City will have lots of military loot and will (hopefully) be a hotspot for players to go to to get good gear. This idea isn't even 10% done, so any feedback would be highly appreciated.  http://imgur.com/dhDhOZO   If i were ever to make it it would be somewhat smaller than altis, its just the shape that i am getting from ireland   i can always just make it smaller if i ever end up actually making it   The terrain is a 70% replication of the island of Ireland, rotated 90* to the left. I have some basic ideas on where mountains will be, but haven't given much thought into choke points yet. no cities or towns have been added yet, as i am having trouble designing them   So i gave up on making the design for this map awhile ago, but recently started working on it again. Here is the basic drawing: http://imgur.com/lWDKGJp Each square is 1 Km by 1 Km, at the longest points it is 14 Km horizontally, and 12 Km vertically. Soon i will add mountains and elevation lines. all feedback is wanted.   yep, because as long as its in alpha, it still applies    So at the moment i have a basic map i made in Paint, and i want to know what software i need to make it look like the maps of chernarus and other maps, any and all help is highly appreciated.  my map - http://imgur.com/wkkgzit reference map - http://imgur.com/m70sWow   what i really like is the gloomy clouds and the street lamps, as well as the flooded area. its good, and i look forward to exploring its depths. (you should put some easter eggs like hidden areas or messages)   http://imgur.com/AN9Mw1e   how can you not like the dayz mod, ive heard of people not liking standalone, but never the mod   good   http://lmgtfy.com/?q=DayZ+Standalone+changlogs   get better   get better   how about you quit bitching, and get better so you dont have a horde of zombies  behind you   http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Are+you+dumb%3F   http://lmgtfy.com/?q=nobody+cares   http://lmgtfy.com/?q=no.   http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Why+am+i+so+bad+at+DayZ%3F   http://lmgtfy.com/?q=where+do+jerry+cans+spawn+dayz+sa%3F  	23

 Isn't this a meme and thus a violation of this thread's rules, though? Serious question, for the record.   Any thoughts on this?   If so, then I'm sorry, but please deal with it. ;)    your don't hear anyone saying euro American  No, but you do hear people saying that they are Italian-American, Polish-American, and/or et cetera.   No; why?   Your mom's house, obviously, for being *way* too naughty there. ;)   So basically bear evolution, correct?   Huh ... looks like Al Gore was right. ;)   They look like rednecks to me, though. ;)         There are valid arguments for both of these things.   If so, then Sweet Charlie must have an incredibly powerful pimp hand. ;)   Actually, pimping is only easy if your pimp hand is way strong. ;)   What can I say? It pays to be a pimp! ;)  # badjoke   Mother I'd Like to Plow Hard. ;)   OGs?   Very true; of course, Israeli Jews's total fertility rate relative to that of Israeli Arabs now appears to be pretty favorable.   I was obviously talking about the technical aspects of this, though. Frankly, I would personally support any man who wants to wear female panties.   Any thoughts on this?   I saw some other memes on here, though.   Pussycats. ;)   Well, your parents probably felt that abandoning you in a corn field would be an insult to this corn field. ;)   If so, then you're thinking of Belarus, rather than Russia, here. ;)   Well, maybe Russia can look at Israel to see what exactly Israel is doing right in regards to this. After all, the current fertility rate among Israeli *Jews* is currently 30.1 or 3.1 children per woman. :)   Actually, Russia is my daddy. ;)   Fuck yeah, she is! :)   So basically, Russia wants Kinder fur Der Reich, correct? ;)   You're straight? Are you sure about that? ;)   That joke is fucking awful!         What if you were born intersex, though?   Agreed.      There is none; I am just saying that some clothes, such as some panties, are especially made for certain people; else, they wouldn't literally be uncomfortable to wear for (many) men with penises.      Actually, I was talking about it in a literal sense--these panties might literally not have enough room for penises. Seriously.   Actually, he might be happy now that he realizes that he might get his 72 virgins earlier than he previously expected. ;)   Great! :) Now, hopefully they will enjoy their 72 male nerd virgins ;) :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dxpMTFBg48     Female panties (often) aren't mean to be worn by males with penises, though. ;)   http://omniatlas.com/  A great atlas for post-1818 maps. :)   Yep, though I think that having Colorado do this was legal. After all, don't the states themselves determine how to pick electors?    I'm not so sure... I guess "Was the Redemption inevitable" is one of those unknowable questions of history.  Do you honestly think that the North would have had the will to keep large numbers of U.S. troops in the South for decades, though?   Either way, "You'll let us terrorize, disenfranchise and persecute black citizens, and we'll make your guy president" is pretty awful.  That already began to occur before the 1876 election, though. In fact, I think that there were only 3 Southern states where federal U.S. troops were still stationed in 1876.   Why not cross-dressers, though?    Maybe, but then the south wouldn't have been left to the redeemers.  Actually, I don't think that the North would have been willing to keep large amounts of federal troops stationed in the Southern U.S. eventually.  This election was so crooked it fucked up free elections for nearly 100 years.  Frankly, I am extremely skeptical of this due to the fact that I think that Redeemer rule in the South would have eventually been inevitable either way for the reason which I stated above.   Ah, Yes, Kazakhstan, Home of Borat! ;)   "No, No, No--what exactly is that American flag bikini doing here?" ;)   Wow! I can't believe that it took them this long to do this! ;)   Actually, Hayes might have won if this election would have been completely free and fair due to the fact that Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina all had a Black-majority population back then.   Understood.   Wow! He sounds a lot like myself in many respects. :) Seriously.      Out of curiosity, though--what exactly was your ex-husband's sexuality?   Sure, she's discussing her own lived experiences. However, I stand by my statement that she is hastily generalizing by assuming that *all* cross-dressers only do it for sexual reasons.   Thank you. :) For the record, though, unlike you, I was born with a male body, so yeah.   So jock-straps and the like?    Late 20s.  Understood.   Have you seen a gender therapist?  No, not yet. However, I certainly intend to do this eventually. :)   One can argue that cross-dressers *are* making a type of temporary transition, though.   Yes, I get all of that, but I am unsure that this makes these terms themselves less valid when it comes to cross-dressers.  Also, please let me think about how I best want to express my own thoughts on regards to this. :)    Yeah I basically consider myself "some kind of genderqueer" in my head.  OK.  I've thought about a gender therapist but it's not really a priority right now :)  Well, if you will have the money for it, then at least seriously consider doing this eventually. After all, it might end up helping you out. :)  I am going to be starting a new job later this year though, and definitely want to come up with a more neutral sounding nickname to introduce myself by at the office.  Good luck with this, then! :)  Also, though, out of curiosity--exactly how old are you right now?   So a genderqueer appearance wouldn't be sexually attractive for you?   I certainly understand where exactly you are coming from in regards to this. However, I think that you are hastily generalizing about cross-dressers' motives; after all, I myself would enjoy cross-dressing if I had a nicer and much less hairy body, but my own interest in cross-dressing is primarily non-sexual.   I'm actually very aware of this, but thank you anyway. :)   Insulting in what sense, exactly?   Thanks for sharing this info. :) Also, maybe you are genderqueer. :)  In addition, out of curiosity, did you talk to a gender therapist about this yet? After all, a gender therapist might be able to help you out in regards to this. :)   No, I'm just lazy. ;)   Yeah, I will make sure to ask this question there. :)  However, if I am right in regards to this, then would you be okay with giving me an apology for this?   Frankly, I really should ask transgender people about their views in regards to this.   What you are telling me is actually news to me. Seriously. Thus, here's what I am going to do--I am going to ask transgender people on Reddit and elsewhere their thoughts about using such terms to describe non-transgender cross-dressers. After all, I might as well educate myself on this, no?   Understood.   OK.   Why, though?   What exactly do you mean by "basically"? I'm just curious.   Understood.   What if he wants to be a civil rights activist and to stay where you two currently are and to personally fight this bigotry, though?   Actually, in such a case, you would be an FtM cross-dresser, but not an FtM transgender person.   Great to hear! :)   So you're a lesbian?   So what exactly would they need to do in order to look attractive to you?   What if everything that he is going to ask you to do is to go to public events with him while he is dressed as a woman so that the two of you will look like a lesbian couple? Serious question, for the record.   But what if she wants to present as a male while she is cross-dressing?    I don't see any problem with the way you designated your opposite-sex cross dressers. I can sorta see why other people might not be pleased with it but alas.  Well, Yeah--it's just much more convenient to use short abbreviations for this. :)  And my answer is shit yes I would. I would have a killer time participating, too.  Would you enjoy going with him to public events looking like a lesbian couple, though?    FtM and MtF are terms for binary trans people, not for people who cross dress.  Source, please?  I'd date a woman who cross dressed. Would be awful hypocritical of me not to.  I wouldn't date a woman who cross-dressed and used the term FtM to describe herself or her fashion choices.  Out of curiosity, though--what exactly is your sexuality?   Understood.   Understood.   Understood.   What if it was important that you were involved, though?   Good to hear! :)   Well, there are a few men who are that short.  Also, though, they can buy their own female clothes. :)   Is this invalid terminology for cross-dressers, though? After all, it's much more convenient than writing this out.   Also, it would certainly be nice if one avoids making hasty generalizations, including in regards to my question here.   Out of curiosity--are you very short?   I didn't ask about trans people here, though.  After all, not all cross-dressers are transgender.   Any thoughts on this?         Thanks for clarifying this part.  Also, I am certainly glad that I could be of help to you! :)   Also, no offense, but a Google search might have avoided years of agony for you. Just saying. ;)   No problem! :)   But then the act itself still won't be illegal; rather, simply talking about it might be illegal.   Yes, it is. Also, that book's name might be The Kingdom of Matthias. :)   Yes, it certainly is an attack on free speech; however, it still doesn't make gay sex itself illegal.   That doesn't make homosexuality itself illegal, though.   Putin the Ass:  http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/putin.png     Gay sex *isn't* illegal in Russia, though.   Great news! :) After all, the War on Drugs is obviously a failure and should thus be ended.   Unlike Socrates and Jesus, though, Abraham didn't die for his beliefs--did he?   Any thoughts on this?   Eh ... frankly, I myself like Stewie both ways. :)   OK, cowboy (or cowgirl). ;)   Robots, of course. ;)   If *he* will win the Latino vote, then the KKK will win the Black vote. ;)   So you're a time traveler, eh? ;)   After all, Jesus's and Socrates's life stories have notable similarities.    I don't remember him running around naked in the streets.  Were you actually there, though? ;)   Frankly, this reminds me of Josef Mengele (sp?) giving candy to Jewish children before he conducted *extremely* brutal experiments on them. :(   Actually, we exist because the Flying Spaghetti Monster (a.k.a. His Almighty Noodliness) willed it. ;)   Apparently that part of this article got stuck in his ass; that's right--his ass can tear apart online articles--that's how powerful it is! ;)   "Oh, what a cute little puppy! In fact, it's cute enough for punch!" *Punch!* ;)   Yep! :)      It is worth noting that the U.S. conducted nationwide censuses from 1790, though; in contrast, the first nationwide railroad in the U.S. was only completed in 1869, 79 years later!   Intellectually honest and decent people would nevertheless oppose this, though.   You might very well be correct in regards to this. :(   Do you mean people with the last name Taft?   Then Third Wave Feminists can either get some sense or go to Hell.   Did you see any images of President Taft there, though? ;)   No--rather, like my and my parents' trip to Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands that year. :)   For the record, here is a book about this man: http://www.amazon.com/The-Kingdom-Matthias-Salvation-19th-Century/dp/0199892490      Any thoughts on this?      Because seven eight [ate] nine. ;)   Also, unless men's and women's bodies react to alcohol differently (do they?), I think that if one argues that women with a certain alcohol level in their bodies are too drunk to consent to sex, then men with the same alcohol level in their bodies should likewise be considered to be drunk to consent to sex. After all, it would be fair that way.    What I'm saying is, when rape claims come up, it's less about the chick proving it than it is about the guy proving it didn't happen, he's generally assumed to be guilty even though the IUPG statement is thrown around.  OK, but *why* exactly is this the case? After all, while I didn't pay much attention to this, didn't the Duke Lacrosse team case bring false rape accusations to the attention of the American public?  A chick can claim rape/sex assault and Kickback while the guy's life unravels and unless he miraculously finds a way to prove his innocence, at best he'll be seen as a sketchball for the rest of his life, at worst he'll be locked up and put on a list.  Why the fuck is this the reality, though? After all, if what you are telling is the truth, then this is a *very* dangerous situation!  Someone sincerely for gender equality totally should be against this but since many feminists are really "anti-men" and don't want actual gender equality, theyre not gonna complain.  Unfortunately, you might very well be correct in regards to this. :(  While I support a lot, if not most, of what feminists advocate, I absolutely loathe it when feminists seek revenge for centuries and millenniums of men discriminating against women. Yes, that was certainly a tragedy and it shouldn't have occurred, but we can't wave a magic and and undo the past. Frankly, if I myself had such a revenge-filled mentality, then I would support throwing a whole bunch of nuclear weapons on Germany in revenge for the Nazis previously killing many of my Jewish ancestors and relatives. However, this would obviously be utter madness, which in turn further demonstrates the utter and absolute futility of having a revenge-filled mentality. After all, I think that David Xanatos in Gargoyles said that "revenge is a sucker's game."   Please forgive me if I am missing something, but it seems like for rape, as for all crimes, the burden of proof should be on the *accuser* regardless of his or her gender. After all, it's "innocent until proven guilty," no?   Why the heck is the burden of proof on the male, though? After all, if one is against sexism and in favor of gender equality, then shouldn't one oppose this?   As far as I know, Russia held its first comprehensive/full (meaning that everyone in Russia was enumerated) census in 1897, whereas many other European countries (Britain, France, et cetera) held their first comprehensive/full census several decades, if not more, earlier than this. My question here is this: why exactly did Russia hold its first comprehensive/full census so late in comparison to other European countries? Was it due to the much greater logistical difficulties involved (of course, this didn't stop the U.S. from conducting such censuses decades earlier than Russia), or was there another reason for this?  Thoughts on this?   If this type of policy was implemented everywhere in real life, then there would be *a lot* more rapes going on to the point of undermining and diminishing the importance of *actual* rapes.   Frankly, if a woman tries pulling such shit on a man, then this man should file an accusation and say that this woman is the one who *raped him*.        Yes, it probably did. Basically, if Hamas doesn't fvck with Israel, then Israel isn't going to fvck with Hamas.         Money speaks louder than facts. :( Unsurprising, but certainly shameful. :(      Agreed. Frankly, I despise equating all Muslims with terrorists just as much as I despise equating all Jews with Communists (which is what the Nazis previously did, with extremely tragic consequences afterwards).   RAmen, brother! :)   RAmen, brother! :)   Good! :) Kindness such as this really should be reported about more often! :)   OK--here is my question:  Do you think that elective orchiectomies (castrations) for sterilization purposes should be available to men in a safe, medical setting (as opposed to in a "back-alley")?  This question is not an abstract one; rather, this question is a very real and relevant question for me personally considering that I myself want to become a eunuch in large part for sterilization reasons but also, if possible (after all, I still want to get erections using my penis) for feminization purposes and to reduce my sex drive.  Now--why exactly am I asking this? Well, many pro-choicers, both on Reddit and elsewhere, have told me that they are unwilling to deal with *any* risk of an unwanted offspring being born. Thus, I see absolutely *no* reason for me to be okay with *any* risk of this occurring. However, since I myself obviously don't have the option of abortion (and would *never* rely on *any* woman's word that she will get an abortion *regardless* of whatever promises she made to me beforehand) and consider the idea of abstaining from penis-in-vagina sex with *all* fertile and potentially fertile women to be both utterly unrealistic and utterly unacceptable, there is no other acceptable choice for me in regards to achieving this goal other than castration due to the fact that *all* non-drastic contraceptives and sterilizations have a failure rate.  Also, before someone brings up the "Do no harm" principle, I would like to point out that:  1. This principle was already thrown out of the window when doctors performed many/most medically unnecessary elective surgeries.  2. Self-castration attempts and "back-alley" castration attempts are *much* more dangerous than getting castrated (as in, getting an orchiectomy) in a safe, medical setting.  3. There is *no* other way for a man to get himself sterilized in a way which *cannot ever* fail.  4. The worst effects of castration can be mitigated/dealt with the help of hormone replacement therapy.  Also, in regards to lawsuits, let me say this--first of all, as far as I know, there are waivers for doctors to significantly reduce or eliminate this risk. However, even if one ignores that, it is worth noting that, short of a massive botching of my (planned) castration (orchiectomy), I myself would consider it to be extremely immoral to sue a doctor for performing a castration (orchiectomy) on me. After all, if I will even try suing such a compassionate and caring doctor for doing this, then this doctor might become more hesitant to perform elective castrations in the future, which in turn could very well result in more self-castration attempts and in more back-alley castration attempts (both of which are (much) more dangerous) afterwards. Thus, for me, suing such a doctor for doing this is absolutely intolerable!  In addition to this, please don't lecture me about biological differences! After all, I myself have absolutely *no* intention of being a slave to biology! After all, just because biology is unequal and unfair certainly does *not* mean that we cannot and should not make it more equal and fairer.  Thus, again, my question here is this--do you think that elective orchiectomies (castrations) for sterilization purposes should be available to men in a safe, medical setting (as opposed to in a "back-alley")?  Any thoughts on this?  	152
 This is one of the nicest backyard pool's I've ever seen. I kinda hate that guy now   I think these new TTs look beautiful   I really really like it. Sure, it doesn't look like a Mustang, but it's still a damn sexy car.   You should watch it. It's kind of amazing.    Nope.   One of the optional voices for SR4 is North but the default is Troy. Booker is totally Troy.   I am jealous    When and where did you see ten minutes if the film? What did you see?    That's not the first line though. There's a scene with Bateman and his friends at dinner first, and then they all go out to a nightclub. Then the next morning he does that speech. I think the first line is a waiter describing dinner.   The scene on the highway where they discover Billy is still alive in the trunk comes before that though    Ah yes you're totally right. Forgot about that.  Still, that refinery is massive.   Oh man the voice acting is absolutely hilarious. Everything about this show is so insane and messed up. I love it.   Whoa, the Nostromo and the Sulaco are waaaaayy bigger than I thought.  Also, all the Warhammer ships look like steam trains, and all the Eve ships look like bits of driftwood.   Well it doesn't look like those those penguins off in the distance are miked in any way, so that's probably a bit of a giveaway   It's pretty blatantly obvious    It was definitely the least subtle in Worlds End    Justin Lin (director of F amp;amp;F 3-6) directed an independent movie in 2002 called Better Luck Tomorrow. Sung Kang is in that as well as a character named Han who smokes a lot.    no it wasn't   Shouldn't have shown Cusack in the trailer   That's worse than being racist    This was the first Godzilla movie I ever saw as a kid. And it was terrible. After that I watched Godzilla vs the Sea Monster.  Also terrible. But then I saw Godzilla vs Biollante and it was awesome. And now I've seen them all.    Patton Oswalt just directed a live read of Raising Arizona with Timothy Olyphant and Ron Perlman   This has been posted a thousand times. This is not the final design. They would not have revealed the final design at the Godzilla Experience like this.  The final design seems to be very similar from what we've seen, and I think Gareth said this was fairly close, but the final design seems to be a lot less chunky and possibly with bigger spikes.   Casino, obviously.   Boogie Nights is basically Goodfellas but with porn actors, one of my all time favorites.   The Departed is kinda similar. Not exactly the same but still gangsters and definitely worth watching.  Maybe try Snatch, Donnie Brasco, Carlitos Way, Usual Suspects, Blow, True Romance, Chopper, American Hustle. Scarface is like a crazy cartoon version.   There are a lot of gangster movies out there, but very very few of them are as fast paced and naturalistic with an awesome soundtrack like Goodfellas. Casino and Boogie Nights are definitely the other movies I can think of that are quite the same. Wolf of Wall Street seems to be the most Goodfellasy thing Scorcese has done since Goodfellas.   Black + clear = white?  Buaauhh??    Dom Hemingway and Filth look so incredibly similar I can barely tell them apart. I wonder which will be better   Wasn't it already confirmed a while ago that there will be no other Toho monsters aside from Godzilla, and that the monsters he will be fighting will be entirely new and original?   I didn't realize it was all that different watching the trailer, but it looks like he's definitely lost some weight    You think this is bad?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bFIPa0tIM  I absolutely love Jimmy Neutron and Kung Pow, but christ this dude has made some unbearable garbage   oohhh noo   I have Godzilla 1985 on DVD...    Hey at least it's not Damon Lindelof!   Leo as J Edgar Hoover is teeerrrrible   No they should have Paul Walker crash Dom's Charger, and then get struck by lightning, so then Paul Walker's consciousness is inside of the car. Then Dom can drive Paul Walker around like KITT and they solve mysteries together.   Running Scared should really replace Into The Blue on this list.    The only thing I feel the need to say is that Amir's new round glasses look really bad   Fuck that hit me right in the gut    Won't it be weird conceiving children with your twin?

But you probably don't bring it to meet your girlfriends parents and whip it to try and measure dicks with her father   I think they're both stupid. Threatening people will knives and guns is really immature dumb behavior either way.    You carry a knife around? Do you keep it in your black trenchcoat with your make up and Invader Zim velcro wallet?    This is from Jekyll and Hyde.    I'm an Australian and I drove past midnight on my Ps all the time and never got in trouble    You mean a charity car show   Is this game open world? And is there any car customization?   I feel like nothing will ever scratch my itch for a new Forza Horizon   Didn't the Fast 6 bluray come out a while ago? I've had it for at least a month.   I got a PS4 last night at launch and I was wondering why it seemed so bare.    Obviously the part where she gets blood smeared on her face was a separate take    And then that caused her to bite harder from the pain, which caused you to bite harder from the pain, and then you were both laughing and screaming with your teeth clenched on each other's junk   Might be a quasi sequel to the original and a reboot at the same time, just like the other reboots?   What's this from?    If I get a PS4, will my trophies earned on that system show up on my PS3 and vice versa, or is it just a one time transfer over type deal? Can I keep playing the PS3 and earn trophies that will show up on my PS4? Will my PS4 trophies show up on my PS3?    Scorsese doing a big final gangster movie with DeNiro, Pacino, Pesci and Keitel?   I want that so bad   EDIT: Frank Vincent's gotta be in there too    Sounds like something I should read    The giant killer sperm from The Filth freaked me out. Not especially gory or anything bit it just made me feel dirty.  There were some pretty dark things happening in the first half (good half) of Irredeemable. Mostly kids getting killed in various ways.    There was that terrible Lovecraftian book that Alan Moore wrote where a woman got raped by a fish demon and then later gave him a handjob. That was doubly fucked up because that was the genius behind Watchmen, Killing Joke and V for Vendetta writing that nonsense.  And of course anytime Garth Ennis gets all shock gore crazy, which is usually more fucked up than anything else on my list but I think I've become desensitized to him by now.    Like what?   That series started off really fucked up and great, but then it just sorta went downhill after a while for me    Filming started a while ago and there have been pics from the set floating around here for like 2 months    Jeez. That couldn't have really been the tag line could it?    I'm still super bummed that this isn't a launch game    Yeah slavery was the only injustice black people faced in America and it ended cleanly and simply and there have been no negative race related repercussions since. Get over it already black people. Jeez.    Really? The first one is basically Point Break, the second feels like a cheesy 80s crime movie, the third one is actually about underground street racing in Tokyo, the fourth is an underground Mexican drug cartel movie, the fifth is a bid budget team heist movie, the sixth is a globe trotting crazy spy/mercenaries type action movie, and the seventh will be a revenge movie.    Your Interceptor is stolen at the start of the game and the game is all about getting it back    Apparently neither.    Whoa that's a crazy cast    Single player kinda sucks. But multiplayer is brilliantly fun. Get it on PC or next gen consoles though.    The scheduling conflict was the filming of Hercules, which ended a couple weeks ago, and there's still 2 or 3 months left of shooting for Fast 7. I was hoping this meant The Rock doesn't get left out of most if the action, but it seems like he might.    Does Ghost Protocol really fit?    I do this every night with your son   That is bafflingly hilarious    I dunno, jammed its head through the door way or something   The T-rex wasn't originally in the cargo hold.   It was in that big steel cage that was sitting on the deck of the boat. We see it in that cage after Roland tranquilized it when everyone is leaving the island by helicopter.  Then when Malcolm and Sarah get on the boat you can see that the cage is torn open. The T-rex broke out of the cage, killed a bunch of people, and then chased people into the cargo hold or something, and a dying crew member closed the cargo doors.  There was that one hand inside the captain's cabin holding on to the steering wheel, which was weird, but I guess maybe the T-Rex was able to stick his head through the door to eat that guy or something.   So you're saying being a Brony is not a choice   Well that looks awesome as shit   I haven't seen it yet, but how much screen time does Dean Norris get ?    I would actually love it if the next movie featured a scene where Vin Diesel jumps his Charger over a shark   The cheesy church music and the fact that it seems to be pretending that this is a true historical event make this movie seem way more like a laughable made for TV religious family movie with a big budget.  The clapping didn't help either.  Hopefully this was just a terrible trailer and was not at all representative of the final film...   The meaning for to be the fun of a game wherein we are to be online with friends is the meaning of what it is for us all together.    The school nurse one is crazy hot. Never heard of something like that before    No she wasn't    Wait, who's that guy playing Steve Haines? I could have sworn he was voiced by H Jon Benjamin when I was playing the game   Not really. It's a trilogy of thematically linked films, all about revenge with a very dark twisted tone, but they're completely unrelated in terms of story and characters.  Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Oldboy, and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. Oldboy is absolutely the best one.    It's clearly some sort of weird tiki statue or something, but that doesn't stop it from looking fucking freaky as shit.  Could you imagine accidentally stumbling upon that thing while messing around on Street View.   MMNNAGH MMNAGHGH  BAKKAAGH MMNMAAAGHBBAAH   The Rundown and Fast Five are legitimately fantastic cheesy action movies.   ...Kelsey Grammar?

I bought a tank from the military vehicles website as Trevor, but it's not at my Pillbox Hill garage or any of my safe houses. What gives? Have I just flushed 3 million down the drain?    So did Hank   And then how do you start this mission?   I find them around the movie studio quite a bit   The movie studio usually has nice cars parked inside it. That's where I got mine.    I am so sick of zombies in everything   Definitely agree   God I hope so   Can you continue playing as all three characters once the campaign is over?  I've heard rumors about one if the characters potentially dying. I remember how much it sucked when John died at the end of Red Dead. I mean it worked great for story reasons, but since there was no warning I had to restart and play through the entire game again so that I could create an alternate save before the end so I could keep playing in the open world as John.   So without giving too much away, will I be able to keep playing as all three characters when the story ends, or am I going to have to create an alternate save or something?  	109

Maybe you should read what you post. Bowman bought outbound grain and used glyphosate to select for Monsanto's trait. His actions were a willful and intentional attempt at avoiding paying Monsanto's licensing fees.    Polluting our food supply with their patented genes, and then seizing other farmers' crops when they test positive for those patented genes.    Thank god that has never happened!   Which is why I always try and pay with a card.    If there were RR vegetables on the market I would have no issue consuming them.    [Citation Needed]   What poisonous chemicals?   aggressively pursue farmers that grow these GMO crops despite the fact that they may spread their progeny naturally for miles around    Monsanto has never sued over accidental cross pollination, they only sue over willful and intentional isolation and growing without a licensee. Example being the case cited in Food Inc over Percy Scmeiser.     I'll quote the actual court case.    [In late June or early July of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser and his employee Carlyle Moritz hand sprayed Roundup around power poles and in the ditches along the Bruno road where it bordered fields 1, 2, 3 and 4. This was part of his normal weed control practice. Several days after the spraying, he noticed that a large number of canola plants had survived the spraying. To determine why the canola plants had survived the Roundup spraying, Mr. Schmeiser conducted a test in field 2. Using a machine sprayer set to spray 40 feet, he sprayed Roundup on a section of field 2 in a strip along the road. He made two passes, the first weaving between and around the power poles and the second adjacent to the first pass, parallel to the power poles. He testified that by this means he sprayed a good three acres of field 2. According to Mr. Schmeiser's evidence, after some days, approximately 60% of the canola plants sprayed were still alive, growing in clumps that were thickest near the road and thinner as one moved into the field.[23]At harvest time in 1997 Mr. Schmeiser, who was then recovering from a leg injury, instructed Mr. Moritz to swath and combine field 2. Mr. Moritz did so, harvesting the canola in the field as well as the surviving canola along the roadside. The harvested seed was put into the box of a 1962 Ford pickup truck. The box was covered with a tarp and the truck with its tarped load of canola seed was stored in one of Mr. Schmeiser's buildings over the winter.[24]Mr. Schmeiser testified that in the spring of 1998 the seed from the Ford truck was transferred to another truck and taken to the Humboldt Flour Mill for treatment, a normal process to rid the seeds of disease before planting. The treated seed, mixed with untreated seed from his granary ("bin-run seed"), was planted in all or part of each of his nine fields, for a total of 1,030 acres.](http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2002/2002fca309/2002fca309.html)         His crop did not magically become 95-98% RR canola purity overnight and the court realized this. Schmeiser was not sued over accidental cross pollination, but over intentionally isolating RR canola plants and planting the seed the following year.        There was also the more recent OSGATA V. Monsanto case, in which OSGATA sued Monsanto over aggressive/bullying practices, the judge throughout the case because OSGATA could not prove their claim in court.       From the Court Case.       [Taken together, it is clear that these circumstances do not  amount to a substantial controversy and that there has been no  injury traceable to defendants.

Also about suing farmers, Monsanto only sues over willful and intentional isolation of their license seed. They don't sue over accidental cross pollination.

Yes that's the current drug form GW Pharmaceutical, but that study was not blinded. It's the next stage that is planned to actually test for efficacy of the drug as a treatment for epilepsy.    Just under epilepsy most the the links were 404s and the only one that was at all relevant (blinded) had a really small sample and lack of statistical analysis.    How many of those are clinical controlled studies?   I'm just happy that my ideas are getting the mainstream attention that they deserve.    Alternative medicine is not marketed as a drug because it's illegal to do so the US. Hence why all herbal medicine comes with a disclaimer on the packaging.       [I'd be shocked if either grew.](http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/400/d2/d21d4f32-78f9-4e2a-a3e9-dd99f8ef3057_400.jpg)   I disagree, I believe that its the governments responsibility to ensure safe guards when it comes to medication in order to ensure that there is a threshold of safety and efficacy taken into account. I don't believe that we should allow people to peddle snake oil and alternative medicine as scientifically effective treatments.    Are you saying those dozens of parents are lying and that it is just coincidental ?     Until there is actual controlled data we'll never know. It could be an actual effect, it could be confirmation bias, or it could be a placebo effect.    You mean supporting the current law when it comes to all medical drugs?    We should ban the marketing, selling, and prescription of herbal home remedies as an effective treatment for disease or illness.    I'm not talking about legalization of drugs, I'm talking about the use of a marijuana as medical drug used to effectively treat disease or illness.    A therapeutic index of 1.   There actually is a clinical trial being conducted at the moment looking into MMJ effect on seizures in children. So far there results look promising but the current completed phase wasn't blinded as it was only looking for safety of the concentrate/extract.     Just that things that only feel very good tend to be made more illegal than things just feel ok.  I think this is confirmation bias, for who cares about the things that don't make us feel good that are made illegal.    Again, my issue is with the use of it as a medical drug without the proper testing   studies.     I'm ambivalent to its legalization and support removing it from its current DEA schedule 1 status. I'm against using it to treat disease and illness when there is no strong evidence supporting its efficacy.    Doctors and mmj clinics are prescribing and selling it as a drug in many states.    My stance is simple. MMJ lacks the required clinical evidence to support its use as a drug. Once proper testing is done I'd me fine with it being prescribed by trained professionals.     You are the one who doesn't care about the actual evidence.    Yeah, because I desire adequate evidence before I want to see something marketed and sold as a drug.    [Citation Needed]    No one is claiming that jumping off a sky scraper is going to treat epilepsy.    And I agree, the punishments for marijuana use/possession are way to harsh and there is to much control over research of the plant and its chemicals.    Again, an anecdotal account is not sufficient evidence to base medical policy off of.    I don't believe marijuana is dangerous enough to be classified as a schedule 1 drug.    Deciding what drug to use to treat an illness or disease has nothing to do with DEA scheduling.    US isn't the only country, and many of these studies have been in the work long before the recent rounds of states legalizing it.    I'm not denying that there are too many regulations on the study of cannabis and its chemical derivatives.    And hundreds of families have traveled to Texas to be treated by Burzynski "medicine".    I don't really care what other people consume, I do care that people are marketing marijuana as an effective drug for treating hundreds of illnesses and disease without strong empirical evidence.    I'm not saying marijuana is bad for you, only that the evidence that supports its use as an effective medicine is weak.    GW Pharmaceutical is running trials in the US looking into cannabis as a treatment for epilepsy in children. They also have already put to market a cannabis based medication for the treatment of MS in Europe, and there are several trials looking into using it in cancer patients.    Nope, I just want some strong empirical evidence stemming from controlled clinical trials before I'm comfortable with selling anything as a drug.   Typo, I meant enema     http://www.cancer-treatment-tips.com/coffee-enema.html   It's not, there are several on going trials as we speak.    Most illnesses that mmj is claimed to treat aren't support by controlled clinical trials. This is a fact.   We have anecdotal evidence that coffee edemas cure cancer and vaccines cause autism. Thank god we don't base medical decisions off these accounts.   You are making the assumption that this treatment is actually effective at treating seizures.    It's a lack of clinical controlled studies, the same threshold that any other new drug has to meet before it can be sold as a drug.    Studies are being done.   I'm against the current use of MMJ, from the lack of strong clinical data showing its efficacy to how it's administered/prescribed.    Self reported study and a case report.     There is ample evidence to support further research of cannabis into treating epilepsy in children, but the evidence today is far short of supporting it as a proven medical treatment.    How? Evidence for the effectiveness of MMJ is lacking for many illnesses it is claimed to cure. Just because people have been using marijuana for "decades" doesn't make up for the lack of empirical evidence.    There's actually a current study going on that is looking into the effects of a MMJ extract on epilepsy in children.    [So far they have tested for safety of the extract and they are moving onto effectiveness of the treatment soon.](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150413183743.htm)   No it doesn't.    It's not about not understanding the MoA, it's that most of MMJ health benefits are based on anecdotal accounts that are akin to snake oil and other alternative medicine.

  The district attorneys office declined to file charges against the officers. Deputy Dist. Atty. Rosa Alarcon wrote in a memo about the shooting that Diaz Zeferinos right hand was no longer visible from the officers angle and that it was reasonable for them to believe he was going to reach for a weapon.  This shit needs to stop. This kind of answer is such a common one size fits all answer in regards to unwarranted police shootings, and it seems to fly an alarming majority of the time.   Basically the translation is "Well cops have a dangerous job, they made a split second decision that was well within their rights to make, so no ones getting in trouble."  I'm fucking sorry, but 3 cops shooting someone 8 times point blank where there was no weapon is absolutely unacceptable.  Due to the miscommunication with the dispatcher who mistakenly reported it as a robbery (dispatch here is also very much at fault....) guns trained is understandable. But what it escalated to was absolutely not.   We absolutely need to find a peaceful solution to this type of thing. Police need to stop being able to hide behind their badges and the authority to make tough decisions and be held fucking accountable for their actions.   That depends on way too many unknown factors to provide an accurate answer.   Here's the best I can do:  If you're trying to gain weight, consume more calories than you burn.

I'm certainly no Olympic swimmer, don't get me wrong, but I honestly can't recall a time where swimming was ever difficult for me, it always came naturally and I've grown up around water.

Citizen science rocks, and there is nothing condescending about this statement - I have subscribed to the SETI project in the past, and try to help out with local citizen science projects because they are a great way to learn about other areas of science.  The Clean Energy Project is a great way to make a contribution, and to learn about what is going on.  Never a bad thing to be involved in good science at any level.    This guy doing citizen science got his name on a Science paper: http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/stardust-citizen-scientist-finds-first-dust-from-outside-solar-system-1.2736547  Cool.    Agreed that they will be different.  There will most likely be no magic silver bullet to solve each problem - are you talking portable (vehicle?) storage? Grid-level storage? Remote storage (Antarctica, small village cut off from grid)?  Each will have a different answer, and thus R D for a host of different scenarios is most likely the right approach.     Hi - one thing that you can do is to put your name into the database of reviewers for the journals you like to read, and secondly, write the associate editors of the journal with a quick note, and a brief summary of your background.  We are always looking for people with expertise in all areas of science, as everyone is extremely busy these days.  If someone has published papers in a specific area, it would bode well that you could be a reviewer for that area.  I sometimes call on people in industry who haven't published in a while if I know that they are actively working on research in the area (i.e., I see them at conferences).  	4
 If it was me it would've been an instant divorce right then and there.    I do it every year, always gets a laugh.    I make my mom pick me up still. Last year we almost knocked down the tree! Crossing fingers to get the whole tree down next time.   I joke about being pregnant ever year! My girlfriend doesn't find it funny anymore..   Right now in just gazing at the stars and I was really curious on why stars twinkle and sparkle?       Come on gang, MySpace here we come!   So if I dye my pubes, would it feel like jacking off another dude? Asking for a friend.    I applaud you sir, paybacks a bitch  	9
 That was really neat to watch, thank you for sharing : )   Mysterious Universe is amazing. Clyde Lewis is like a cross between old C2C and Alex Jones, very fun, worth checking out. The Unexplained with Howard Hughes is pretty good.    Definitely! Unfortunately I'm not sure about anything cheap as far as cameras, but I'm sure others can direct you where to look. Have fun watching the skies!   I have seen them. Fuck, I'm of the opinion at this point once you've seen them, you see them more often. Or rather, you learn how to look for them. Good luck with your future viewings, oh, and bring a camera.   Came here to say just that, thank you for beating me to the punch :)   I've never experienced it before or since. Could it just happen once in a lifetime?   I have not visited anyone about hypnosis yet, it is something I am seriously considering tho. And I don't recall 'grabbing a knife', I don't. No recollection, none. I only discovered that after the fact. My friend and I were at a Mormon College in Idaho. (byu-i). I did not have any marks, bruises, cuts, contusions, or anything that would suggest I physically fended off anyone with an intent to harm me or my roommate. We did have activity that we heard both in the apt and in our room. I personally saw a thick, white mist in the hallway billowing towards me at one point. As the only door and all the windows were locked and we were absolutely certain we were alone, we believe it was something else. Whatever it was moved plenty of furniture, opened cabinets, moved silverware, and certainly scared the living shit out of me and my friend. I do think that I may have blocked it b/c of sheer terror and fear, but what could be more scary than what I'd already experienced? Why when we said a prayer did we see a black shadow move across the wall, and the activity stop for about fifteen minutes, enough time so that we started laughing about how weird and creepy that was only to hear grinding/dragging noises in the kitchen as we had originally heard? (that sound, btw, was chairs being dragged thru the kitchen, dining room, and into the living room, so it happened twice.) It was when we said something my Mother had told me to say in the presence of demons (In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to leave!) that is when everything just goes dark. Literally like a curtain being put over my eyes. I remember nothing until the next morning when my roommate woke me up to show me everything was back where it was the night before, like we'd never gone thru the apt and put all the chairs and furniture back. BTW, nothing ever happened in that apt ever again as far as I know. I don't know what it was, and I am pretty skeptical of ghosts, but I cannot discount what happened to me and my friend. I cannot discount what I heard, saw, or the nagging feeling of "i need to know" what happened that night. I am going to really consider what you said about going to psychics. I would prefer having an open minded professional that won't tell me I'm wrong about what I might find in my mind. Like, if they can't handle that I know I saw and heard some things then I wouldn't like to work with them on hypnosis. I need them to be able to listen without me fearing any kind of "you're lying", "you're mistaken", "that couldn't possibly have happened", etc etc. This event really happened, and I am sure it couldn't be just me and my friend that have had something like that happen to them. I just wonder why I blacked out or had missing time. That part bothers me more than any other aspect of that night.     This happens to me when I get drunk and am simultaneously stressed. Freaked me out the first few times, but hasn't happened to me in a few years. I don't think it is terminal as I am still alive! Hizzah!   Without going into too much detail, I had an experience one night many years ago with a roommate. We were talking in her room when a litany of incredible poltergeist activity began ensuing. Apparently, this went on all night. I can't actually say just what happened after one point since I literally remember everything suddenly going back. Since this night I've heard some snippits of things that happened. For instance, my friend who my roommate and I had called and left a voicemail, we asked her to come right away, something really scary was going on. When she arrived in the morning (she worked nights), she found my roommate and i barricaded into her room, huddled in a corner with a knife. She says that when she was able to get thru the barricade that me and my roommate attacked her. I remember absolutely NONE of this. Is there anyone here that has heard of or experienced any such thing? I have looked for years online and have not found anything that connects ghosts with missing time. Only ufos. I don't think this was a ufo abduction, b/c of my friend seeing me and my roommate in that way. Any ideas or comments would be greatly appreciated, this event has caused me to consider undergoing hypnosis to actually recall the events.   yep. i thought so when i saw mine :)   . the misuse of this meme hurts my eyes!   I am here for knowledge. :)   I was mormon. Now I am an atheist and happily so :)   Typically UFO sightings are eerily quiet. So, I would question if this was not something that a military on earth created.  Just my 2 cents!   o.O   so hot   They absolutely appear to be intelligent.   I lived in Rexburg...really strange point in my life.   Oh yeah, she's absolutely IN ON the joke. She was on Chelsea Lately telling about how the college boys'll bring her sausages and ask her to sign em. At first she was embarrassed but now she's says "Bring It On!" = )  I 3 Giada      I decided when I was like 3 that I didn't want to be a babymaker. Nope, not for me. I didn't want to raise children in this life, why the next?   No. Just no.   You right.    Pinworms. They won't kill you and antibiotics can clear em up :)   My parents.   That sucks you should definitely seek counseling if you haven't gotten it already.  also, you can go to [r/exmormon](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon) to share  your experience. I'm sure the folks over there would be interested in your story.   This is hilarious :)   Sure there were Romney trolls asking questions and trying to cause drama. Still tho, there were very good questions that people really wanted answered on that AMA. Things that were deeper than "the white house beer recipe". I understand that certain questions really deserved a more in-depth answer than could be given on an AMA, but to disregard all those important questions is suspect. However, the site crashed, so it's hard to know if he was going to answer.   genius   Excellent article. I am studying for my Exam stateside and am glad to have these tips right from the get-go. Thanks for sharing!   So worth it :)   In Your Opinion   Part of me thinks the reason for this was because she was there for some of these events, and she outright lied about it.   I'm not saying it's a weather balloon, but it might be swamp gas loooool   Yep, looks like a weather balloon to me, too.      Whoa...   Yes...but he spouts the scientific system without knowing what he is 'debunking'. Problem I have with this is people out there are going to just believe him, because he is a magazine writer...   YES   It really seems like the skeptic has never really looked into the phenomena deeply. I've been studying it for years, and yes, there is physical evidence. It's trace, but damnit it's there. On top of that, he sounds like an idiot. The picture they showed, while old, is famous and very well documented as a real *something*. He didn't even seem to recognize it. How can you have a skeptic that doesn't know the ins and outs of a phenomena he is so sure doesn't exist? I mean, let me give an example: I used to be religious. I know the ins and outs of the religion that I was a part of and when I was coming out of that religion to what I am now, I was able to look at all the facets and realize how every point was untrue. I can point to part of the religion and explain why it's false, I can PROVE it's false. This skeptic, couldn't do that. He couldn't prove his assertion. He just blindly stood by it. Pathetic. And yes, a Naysayer.   Nice digging!   Stay strong and STAY IN CONTACT.   That part confused me as well. What actual NON-humans are deciding elections? Is it my dog?   You guys need some reformation out there, stat.   it's an unknown!!   Let the addicts go into crazy withdrawl. They'll eventually be cut out of existence. Harsh? Yeah. But I never have had a moral problem with people taking care of other people, with or without Police assistance. And I am sure that they are uncontrollable, and no one needs violent addicts in their community, whether it be in the slums or not.  Also, I heard that Brazilian police are corrupt as all hell. They only take care of their own, and the people have learned to fend for themselves. Sadly, it looks like with the police bruatlity in America, it's slowly turning that way here, too.   Yeah, when you tell them your neighbor stole your girlfriend, of course they are going to back you! You failed to mention the weight gain, the slothfulness you live in now, the fact that your hoarding caused a large part of the rat infestation, that the HOA had to come in and clean up because You Wouldn't. You have a problem Bob, go get counseling. And, no, that isn't code for "go think while you mine for gold ore in Feralas" and gripe to your guild.    Honestly, I'd rather deal with a coke-head than a crack-head. If they don't want to sell a worse drug, even if it's just for monetary purposes, fuck it, I'm for it. Crack is bad, mmmkay?   Reports of UFO's have been around since LONG before Chris Carter (creator of X-Files) was even born. And even before we had planes. I don't know why exactly the UFO's are interested in the US, you are right, there are more REPORTED sightings here. There are woodcuts from Nuremberg, Germany depicting battles in the sky between flying things from 1561.  Also, I would say that more people probably believe in ET's and UFO's in this day because of the sheer improvement in knowledge. We know that we're made of stardust, we know that the universe is incredibly old, we know that the building blocks of life are scattered throughout the universe. We know now about Panspermia. The chances of us being alone are nil. It's either us or there is a lot of life universally. So, if you start there, universe being old and filled with building blocks of life. Then you add in that we humans are barely a Type 1 civilization, and if you can imagine there may be Type 2 or even 3 civilizations, then it becomes harder to conceive that they wouldn't have technology to bend/fold/manipulate time and space.  So much to think about. But truthfully, the best thing I can tell you to do is look up. If you have access to GOOD Night Vision Binoculars, that will help too, as many of these crafts are only visible outside of our visual spectrum. Which could mean they are inter-dimensional or from another universe(maybe). It's just, honestly, super unlikely that we are alone. I think, you should start there. Contemplate: Could it just be us? Could this vast universe filled with the building blocks of life only have harbored life on Earth? I think if you consider it in those terms you will find that the odds are quite small we could be alone. Of course, if you are looking for a dead body and DNA, I am unable to produce that.   Also, I don't know if the government is maliciously hiding information on this subject. I mean, I don't have special insider knowledge. BUT, I will say this: Our government HAS reported UFO's over nuke sites, these craft seemingly disabled (individually and remotely) their equipment. Also, you should look into the Rendlesham Forest Incident. Lots of military personnel reported seeing something strange over a few nights there, too. You can view the documents thru the FOIA. These are well-documented cases, too. The Mexican military also has RELEASED information and video concerning unknown flying objects over their skies as well. You can see this as easily as going to Youtube.   Maybe because we don't share their media? And, honestly, MUFON is just one of the many UFO reporting networks. I don't speak Chinese, so I don't know what reporting networks they have out there that I might be missing.  Have you heard about the Hessdalen Lights? Those are in Norway. They have sightings in Australia that are frequently reported.   Could really be a language barrier and that US media is USA biased in that they report mostly on things happening in the bubble of USA.   When you see an accident, do you call the UK police? Or do you call the American police? I think if you consider that sort of thinking it might make more sense to what I'm trying to convey. But I'm certain these events happen worldwide...imagine what happens over the oceans that no one ever sees?  OOOH and if you notice, most sightings that are reported happen in first world countries. So, that is another thing. Do they only hapen over FWC's? Probably not, we just have the ability to do so. That guy in the African bush isn't gonna get on his Iphone to take photos and upload em to Facebook and Twitter. India is mostly a 3rd world coutnry, people are too poor to really report, and China? I mean, it's communist, so it's very possible a lot of info doesn't even reach us.  Food for thought. I'm exhausted and going to bed. Take care and good luck with your search!!   I'm not going to make any excuses for you anymore, Bob. You have a serious problem, and it needs to be addressed. However,  you cannot have your girlfriend back, she's mine.   Addiction comes in all forms. Just because Bob is addicted to WoW, lost his girlfriend, job, dog, truck, gained 145lbs in two years, lives in filth, doesn't mean that Jake, next door, who also plays WoW on occasion, raises his daughter as a single parent and is quite stable, shouldn't be allowed it due to Bob's problem.  Insert a name of a drug for WoW (crack, meth, alcohol...) and you will see that it's all relative.    I would be very surprised if this was a terrestrial entity/craft/what-have-you. I didn't get any real direct impression about the intelligence it may or may not have possessed. For all I know it was a ball of energy that is sentient. I just do not know.   That is a difficult question to answer. In a way, it seemed biological, so if it was an "intelligence", it's different from humans. Really hard to quantify without more information, tho.   That is my point. If you have an inherent problem with drugs than that is your own prerogative, but I don't find drugs a 'bad' thing. meh. i was just stating how i felt.    That's right. I mean, I don't do the stuff myself. But I don't think it inherently makes one bad or a druggie if they occasionally enjoy a sniff or two.   LoooooooL   Honestly, in small amounts, cocaine isn't really that bad. Of course, I know that some people ruin their lives over that white lady, but some people are perfectly functioning members of society who enjoy it on occasion.    That's right!   It confirmed my belief in that we are not the only intelligent creatures in this universe. I always 'knew' that, but this got me hook, line, and sinker. It was absolute.   I'm not even mad, bro    THAT is a really interesting point!   I'm absolutely not ignoring my life. Not even a little. This post was about my lover. As for me, I am getting my life on track and getting a career, and a lot of it is actually because of this person. They have inspired me to do better in my life and go after things that I strive for. In so many ways, he's been good for me. :)  And it's ok that you made me cry, it's hard to hear the blunt truth about life sometimes. But I am giving it my best, and so is he. If it works out that'll be wonderful, but if not, I'll know why. So it's not so bad. I just got emotional when I found out he was leaving is all.   Disclosure won't happen, it's a myth promoted by Greer. They won't even admit it if an Independence Day scenario played out, with giant 'motherships' over cities. They'll just say, "we have a new threat...."   http://www.presidentialufo.com/   Thank you! I feel very lucky to have witnessed such a sight! It was truly unbelievable, but yet, there it was...right in front of me. And, had I had better wits about me I would have taken out my camera phone and video'd or at least taken pictures. I don't know who that officer is, but I know s/he saw it, too, and I know it had to be life changing for them, it definitely was for me. I was always a believer but actually seeing it...it's vastly different.   I think I have a bit of a crush on the intelligence this woman has. *blush*   Good guy drug dealer bans crack b/c he doesn't want to destabilize his community.  Fuck yeah!   I have posted it here in r/ufos  I have also reported it to MUFON and was contacted by their lead investigator, Denise (out of Florida) You can read the report [here](http://ufostalker.com/ufostalker/UFO+Sighting+in+Orlando+Florida+United+States+on+April+2nd+2007/20161)     It is possible they were orbs. They do not look like chinese lanterns as they'd be freaking HUGE compared to the distance.  I'm also not saying this is definitively alien, not at all, I'm just saying that the video in and of itself, is real.  But, I do think it might be orbs. Only because I've seen one, and know others who have seen them. They aren't some new phenomena, either.   Yep, their humor and bullshit filters are fantastic! Definitely some of the funnest guys to listen to on the net right now.  hahaha, hipster contactee :P priceless   Hey now, this looks pretty legit. O.O   You are most welcome, Bangaa! I only share what I love :)   looool, you right   . fuck im sorry..Mo...many apologies   It's been proven time and time again that Marijuana is not addictive. Therefore, this post is not from an 'addict'. If you don't like marijuana, get off our green green lawn!   Because they obviously are advanced creatures who aren't afraid of our primitive technology interfering with them.       btw, reading that made me cry more...but it's ok. i just want what's best for him, it's important for him to ensure he has a stable future.    *sigh* I know it's going to be hard. And I am realistic, I know it may not work. Doesn't mean I won't give it a hearty shot tho.    Very awesome story. Have you thought about reporting this to MUFON? If not you should absolutely do so!   [UFO Stalker](http://www.ufostalker.com) check out that site. The map shows reports from all corners of the globe,and NO, visitation does not only occur in the USA.  Also, not all photos or videos are blurry, either. During my sighting I wish I had taken a photo or video, but I was much much too engrossed in the object merely 25 feet in front of me to really consider doing so. It can be quite the awe-inspiring experience :)   Sorry, made this in a bit of haste.  EDIT: Book Writer should read "Author"   I laughed way too hard at that!   That is sooo cool :)      Welcome :)   http://www.kfi640am.com is based out of California, they have a live player that you can listen to Noorey live, without interference, and they also have some fun other shows too. Hope this helps!   No. I want him to succeed. It's something I have to just deal with. However, I do wish I could go with him, but I can't. :(   If you want to give your money to a really great broadcast, you can try getting a Plus+ Club Account for Mysterious Universe.  You can see their extensive archive [here](http://www.http://mysteriousuniverse.org/tag/podcast/)|  These guys are based out of Austrailia, are hilarious, and they have some of the most interesting programming I've encountered in a while. It's like $9/month for the Plus+ Club, but it's worth it.    Hence why I ventured out of C2C...and landed in Ground Zero   You should! This week they are not broadcasting live, but they are playing back shows that are fantastic! Next week will resume normal programming and later this month they are going syndicated by Premiere Networks, the same company that syndicates C2C. I really hope you enjoy it as much as I do. I really think this guy could be our next "Art Bell".   I used to listen to C2C, but when Noory took over as host he kinda, well, sucked. I continued to listen but I got bored of the content, and missed Art. I've since started listening to Ground Zero Radio with Clyde Lewis. His program and guests are awesome and Clyde is a fantastic host. He brings elements of Art and even Alex Jones (but much less shouting), and has that 'spooky' factor that I'm looking for :)   Depending on how things turn out, it may or may not matter. As of right now, it matters a whole helluva lot.   My lover is leaving for college for the next 1 1/2 - 2 years. He won't have a car with him and I own no car. I am currently saving up for one, but it's going to still be a bit before I can see him. This is upsetting as I just found out Sunday and he leaves Friday. Words cannot express how much I will miss him and how much I also am proud of him, too. Such a mix of emotions that I am going thru. So much is up in the air. I worry, will he find someone else? Will he forget about me? Will he decide that a long distance relationship does not work for him? I wish I had a crystal ball, but I don't think I could peer into it thru my misty, watery eyes.   I, for one, welcome that date being pushed back. I wonder what it'll do to the elections???   If anyone knew his SN we could absolutely ask him to do this, it's amazing.

It's just some generic circles and triangles.   Creative directors (in my experience) are middle managers that know nothing about design.  Well just call me a unicorn. My experience is in the material arts in the 80's, graphic arts in the mid 90's, digital design experience leading to the founding 2 graphic arts and web design companies in NY. During this period I was a contracted as a writer and graphic arts developer for Jupiter Media (Graphics.com) and started designing advertising and developing marketing programs for the Palms in Vegas, among others.   Then got an offer as Executive Creative Director with a company on the west coast.   An Executive Creative Director that doesn't know design is like a doctor that doesn't know anatomy.       That *one* line in my post was in *response* to business-woman bashing. If you are smart enough to breathe and type at the same time you know that. If not, deal with it.    So are you saying that like;  "But usually they're retarded." ?  or   "They type with their dicks." ?   And with resource shortages looming with climate change, keeping as many people poor as possible (less resource competition) while controlled and contained. This is my sneaking suspicion as to why they are militarizing local police forces.   The ones on high horses were the ones attacking this woman and casting unfounded and unreasonable accusations at her, when she was obviously wronged.  Coincidence? Did you even bother to go read the news articles or [look at the image](http://www.opposingviews.com/i/social/oregon-woman-finds-her-t-shirt-design-sold-target-without-her-permission)? It's exact.   I isolated the design and did a google image compare: there are no designs out there exactly like this besides the one at Target.   And 'it happens' is no excuse when fucking with someones livelihood. Kicking someone when they are already down, from the safety of your keyboard anonymity, is cowardly and horrendous.  It's' also clear to me that the design is copyrighted to her under the electronic copyright act.  Source: I am an Executive Creative Director.   Nope - she is very attractive: http://www.opposingviews.com/i/social/oregon-woman-finds-her-t-shirt-design-sold-target-without-her-permission  The only reason I even mentioned it was because of the neanderthalic "She needs to stfu and get back to the kitchen" sort of remarks.   No, assholes who kick people when they are down or on the basis of half-formed bullshit make reddit bad. I don't care if they are male, female or donkey.    "Absolutely not. In fact, I'd increase it if I could..because I could care less about this place or the people here. As long as I can keep paying for my 7 mansions in other places in the world, fuck California."   Fixed it.    I was - 30 yrs ago. He stuck the bag in his pocket and sent me on my way. That moment killed my naivet about how the world really works.   Perfect OP name for this.   Why not? He can afford to live wherever he wants with the proceeds of fucking CA in the ass. And he certainly won't live someplace that is dried up. Same with all of these assholes who are profiting from wrecking the planet one area at a time.    http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/35pq9j/my_friend_who_sells_tshirts_through_etsy_found/   Like the young woman yesterday who had her best selling t-shirt design obviously and without doubt being printed and sold by Target.   Redditors viciously attacked her, attacked the design as 'ugly' and 'unoriginal' (as if their fine sense of aesthetics mattered), attacked everyone selling on Etsy, attacked Etsy itself, claimed repeatedly that she didn't have a leg to stand on (when attorneys in the news articles that said she *did* have a case).   Worst of all the top poster, doing the usual shitty job of playing reddit detective, claimed that she ripped off the Tootsie Roll Indian (on another shirt). That design is actually over 80 yrs old and has been in public domain for years. Despite this being pointed out, hundreds of neck bearded assholes jumped on the bandwagon, calling her a thief and worse. They were so horrible that she literally pulled that shirt from her store.   This lady is supporting her kids from her screen printing operation in her garage. And these fuckwads attacked her - viciously.   For what? Being female? Starting her own business? For doing more with her life than whacking it in moms basement? It was inexcusable and inexplicable. You would have thought half the commenters worked for Target. I am wondering if it ended up having a negative impact on her livelihood.   I am just about fucking done.   Maybe I should have put an 'Irony Warning' at the bottom of the post to clarify it for people such as yourself.   And if you aren't terrified already- here is everything they didn't (dare) teach you in school about this great country.   http://www.historyisaweapon.com/zinnapeopleshistory.html   They are doing what they can to make it illegal to be poor. At least to make their lives as much a living hell as possible.    And according to [Gary Webb](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-levin/gary-webb-was-right_b_6024530.html), and now accepted as fact, the CIA helped bring crack, heroin and cocaine into the US to sell to poor communities to finance the Iran Contra Affair.   The results of this was [horrifying for south america and us](https://youtu.be/azYxPf_Ahp4). That song was written by Bruce after visiting SA during the wars being brought there from the US. Some surviving villagers told him of the villages people being locked into their church and it being set on fire- children and old people to burning alive. We brought utter hell down on those people - and it was Reagans boys who did it.     If God turns out to be a woman.. you are in deep trouble, boy.   Revelations was written by the Apostle John of a series of visions he had of the "end of days".   There certainly weren't enough people on earth when it was written to have a huge environmental impact. That is why it fascinates me. Because now we do have enough people and are having a drastic impact.   Strong's Concordance states the translation for 'earth' basically means: 4a) the earth as opposed to the heavens   And the word 'destroy' (the earth):   to rot thoroughly, to ruin (decay utterly, destroy, perish).

Well, I hope so.  The Indian is over 80 yrs old.     And the largest disaster NASA had was when they underestimated the effect of weather on an O-ring seal.  And now these insane Koch whores at congress want NASA to get out of 'Earth based science'?   ...the head of the Senate committee overseeing NASA claimed the agency should stop doing earth-science and focus only on space exploration.   http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/33jvhg/man_survives_2nd_bear_attack_in_4_years_bit_more/   I had no idea, until this moment, that my 'religion' had a name.   The average American woman miscarries at least 12 times over a normal lifetime. Most of the time they don't even know it has happened.   Or as I used to ask people who asked my opinion on legalization:  "Would you rather run into some Hells Angels high on pot or drunk on Jack Daniels?"   This pope has been different about the whole 'rich lifestyle' thing. He got rid of the papal throne - the gilded robes - drives his own old car and lives in a 2 room apartment instead of the luxurious papal residence. At that apartment, filled with priests and bishops, he eats at the cafeteria with everyone else. He also 'fired' a bishop in the states for spending a lot of money refinishing an upscale residence.   Maybe you should read up on someone before just automatically blasting them. You might be surprised.   http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/03/13/pope-francis-remains-humble-one-year-in/   Actually, it is related to one of Gods last acts toward man, according to Revelations:   The nations were angry, and your wrath has come.     The time has come for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your people who revere your name, both great and small--     and for destroying those who destroyeth the earth."    Rev. 11:18   The Tootsie Roll Indian is over 80 yrs old and in the Public Domain. Glad you aren't on my jury team. ffs.   I am not talking about the victims. I am talking about the News paper. I have 100% sympathy for the victims.   I just think that the news organization was stupid for trying to turn this into some sort of spiritual event using this part of James 1 about two people who died horribly in a storm.    It's labeled 'Tootsie Roll Indian' and that Indian is in the public domain. It's over 80 years old ffs.   Actually no, she doesn't. She talks about purchasing good quality, high thread count t-shirts to use as a base for her designs on her website.    Whose work did she take credit for?   Maybe she should buy some sheep. loom the wool. make the shirt. grow some cotton etc etc.  Yes she hand screen prints the shirts. Exactly as advertised.   ffs. You would think reddit absolutely hates everyone who even tries.    Who did she steal them from? Link to designs or designers? Anything? You are accusing someone in an open court of opinion here. Prove your accusation.   And the Indian is over 80 years of age and is in the public domain- so that does not count.    It's only strong enough for her to support her children on out of her garage workshop.   Not only do you not admire that- you are obviously an asshole on a circle jerk. Let's see some of your brilliant designs.    It's public domain. Once again Reddit hangs an already hurting person from the nearest tree. Nice.    She is. The Indian is a public domain image.    It's a public domain image. No harm no foul. Except for the knee jerks kicking her on reddit. Fucking classic though.    Someone thinks its cool looking - she is supporting her kids on the proceeds instead of being on welfare.   Your edit came a little too late - now hundreds of people are blowing this off because they think she 'stole' the indian design.    Context and intonation- which you weren't there for.     A lot of people also claim they've already seen that #MERICA design on other shirts from other businesses.  That reason?  oh ok.  Too bad that absolutely 0 claims of this were accompanied by links to images.    yw   It isn't an American Flag with the word 'America' on it.   It's a minimalist design of the bars with #MERICA in the space of the stars. And the design she made a year ago is copied exactly by Target- right down to the font type.  Here is a successful and similar lawsuit won by an original artist against American Eagle:  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/29/aholsniffsglue-american-eagle-artist-lawsuit-copyright_n_5627862.html       You can say the same for Marvel Comics Capt. America t-shirt designs with the American Flag. Does this mean she deserves to be ripped off and they don't?   Oh- the American Flag has been used before - so we don't have to license your design.   Or- I don't like the design- so it deserves to be ripped off and monetized by this multinational corporation.  Doesn't fly.    Show me where her exact design has been done and I will agree with you. So far I haven't seen it. A lot of companies use variations of the US flag- and all of their art is protected. Why shouldn't hers be? Because she isn't Marvel Comics or the NFL?    And neither does the 'artistry' of the design. Yet that argument is throughout this thread.    Then tell the licensees of Capt. America flag t-shirts that they no longer have to pay for that particular style. Captains, America, and Flags are everywhere- right?

Since you didn't bother to read it, how you could be so self-assured in attacking this person and her small business?   Obviously I didn't ask for a selfie.   I haven't seen any other shirt design like hers yet- outside of Target.   18 years ago the use of the term 'merica' was unheard of as well as the use of a hashtag.   So I am very doubtful of everything you posted previously.   I am familiar with US design copyright law having known a person who did a design for fabric wall hanging sales- and found her design on an online poster sale site - a clear rip - just as what happened here.   She did sue successfully. Hopefully this woman will be successful as well.    Obviously you didn't read the story or watch the ABC News video.   http://abcnews.go.com/US/oregon-woman-accuses-target-graphic-shirt/story?id=30983944    that she may have even conciously or subconciously 'borrowed' from someone else  I haven't seen it.     http://copyright.gov/circs/circ40.pdf   Copyright is a form of protection provided by U.S. law to authors of original works of authorship, including pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works.

Hers has a hashtag on the front of the Merica- she has a whole line of these.

I am seriously thinking that Target has done the same thing that other corporations have that have negatively hit the front page. Sent in a PR team to lead the conversation against the small business owner and manipulate the up/down votes.    There is copyright on the art.

It depends - you want a shirt that lasts a few months or a few years?  If you read the article or watched the ABC news video you would see that her t-shirts are individually screen printed by hand using  high-end inks on t-shirts with a much higher thread count than Targets. In other words- her shirts will last much longer than Targets.      Wrong. She has been selling this design for over a year on Etsy - to help support her kids rather than going on welfare.    I bet they don't steal NFL logos. And why should the NFL have any more protection than any small business owner in America?

There are multiple sites out there that give the data what are best sellers on Etsy in different departments. Don't need to google it.    So reddit converges on this magazine- viciously attacking it on their twitter feed and Facebook feed over lack of attribution to the band- and it's a pr stunt by the band.  And then this same 'reddit community', a few days later, viciously attacks a woman whose art was actually ripped off and monetized by a major corporation?  I smell a big fat PR team rat.    We have a woman successfully supporting her children by creating designs (whether it's to your taste or not doesn't matter) and screen printing them, individually, by hand, in her garage. Then selling them on an online outlet.   We have a multi-billion dollar, multinational corporation finding the design, probably using [one of the sites that lists the top selling items on Etsy](http://www.handmadeology.com/top-100-handmade-etsy-sellers-2014-by-number-of-sales/), copying it and profiting by selling it nationwide.   What is your 'Case in point' that makes the small business owner wrong and subject to ridiculous attacks while reddit absolves the multinational corporation? I really want to see it.   Obviously she is protected by law against this sort of thing. Or did Target send some PR teams in to lead this circle jerk attacking her, attacking Etsy and even attacking Etsy sellers? It won't be the first time a major corporation has manipulated reddit.   Electronic copyright law says she is protected.

Now we have a multinational corporate box store stealing this persons design and selling it nationwide, at a profit, and the 'top' posters on the Reddit story are excoriating and attacking:  a.

But I don't think he is still here.   Testing of Your Faith  2 Count it all joy, my brothers,[b] when you meet trials of various kinds, 3 for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. 4 And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.  5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. 6 *But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. 7 For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; 8 he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.*  9 Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation, 10 and the rich in his humiliation, because like a flower of the grass[c] he will pass away. 11 *For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.*  12 Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him. 13 Let no one say when he is tempted, I am being tempted by God, for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one. 14 *But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. 15 Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.*  https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1 version=ESV  16 Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers. 17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.[d] 18 Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.               I live in a rather bohemian city (very small) in the mountains. This was a new, small business- so I decided to go there in support. We do crazy liberal stuff like that.   So the guy is talking about how he had a shop in L.A. but decided to move here because it was 'cooler' (literally- we are in the mountains). Then he started talking about local politics in a kind of denigrating manner (while enjoying a glass of the cleanest tap water in the US and breathing some of the cleanest air).  I just maintained a neutral face, to see how far he would go. He apparently took that for acquiescence and said something about how we needed to get rid of all those 'hippies' to "change the liberal politics 'round here".   Despite the fact that those 'hippies' are the ones bringing in entertainment, creating businesses, painting cool murals, holding art events, fairs and farmers markets, promoting local growth and keeping out the big box stores- everything that brings people here in droves to drop a lot of money into the local economy.  And so I knew where he was going from there - and I was done.   [Like this.](http://kochwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kochbrothers.jpg)   I assumed it was a selfie.   They used to call themselves 'Tea Baggers' until they found out what it meant.   Reminds me of the last right wing whacko I met - a guy who cut my hair. I actually pulled off the smock about half way through and walked out. Told friends to not even go there. I don't think he is in business any longer.   I had no idea Kansas had a liberal oasis. Kind of like Austin in Texas? I guess I wouldn't mind living in Kansas.   We still have the guild. It's one of the oldest ones in the game. Pretty retired though. A few old players pop in to say hey every once in a while. I am not going to close shop though till the game ends because we have a few members who passed away (accidents/cancer, etc) and I promised their families.   Could it be a foreigner with a new drivers license?    This is exactly what we were asking for.    Hey. I have chicken thawing right now to make chicken and dumplings.    I was there. This vid gave me chills. He also showed up at Ironforge and that was a helluva fight at the gates.  Also remember flying on a taxi bird to Winterspring and saw below this giant flame dog farting and belching smoke and flame. I rode back to where I had seen it and all of a sudden there was this boss, Kruul, walking toward town. Called on guilds and we took him on, about 20 of us. Wiped us completely out. So we called on some more people and ended up in a 40man competition raid with the Horde to see who got him first.   We wiped- They wiped  Then we brought him down.   edit- found a vid some group made https://youtu.be/knwZl7my-NY   Exactly.

Pitcher for Reds, Cardinals and finally for the Giants during the 1917 World Series 'Black Sox' Scandal. [His picture.](http://i.imgur.com/nACpt.jpg)  Slim barely spent a calm, normal day of his life. Constantly in trouble from the day he was born:  When the routine of practice got too strenuous, Sallee would leave St. Louis' League Park and walk across the street to a social club known as the "Grass Eaters", housed only 100 feet away from the clubhouse. Sallee often "exercised his rights as a member" of this social club. One clubhouse boy said that during games Sallee would lower a bucket over the fence on a rope to a confederate who would fill it (with beer) at the social club.  The players were not allowed to drink, by contract. But Harry would tell stories of being hung out of hotel rooms by the other players, run to a bar and get liquor and come back to the hotel and climb up bedsheets to the room.      Not with over 40% of Americans now living on Minimum wage. I am sure they are eating anything they can afford; mostly high fat, high sugar crap.  Where are you from, Mars?   Chicken.   Sorry, it's proven that people in the US are getting fatter and fatter from eating poorer foods and trying to make up for vitamin/mineral deficiencies by eating more. Also the food choices for the poor are overloaded with fats and sugars to make cheap bulk.    Just wait.. they are going from fat shaming to poor shaming. Just as bad and as likely they will end up there the way things are going.  I don't know what has happened to reddit lately either- but the most shameful thing is the attitudes.  One note- Poverty is the living, breathing proof of failure of the political and corporate system in a country. To set people up to blame the poor is absolving the politicians and corporate heads of their failure. Don't do it.   I knew a woman from West Virginia who moved to a northern city. She married at 13 and had her first child in WV. She didn't know what birth control was or how to prevent pregnancies- knew nothing about it whatsoever- until her first visit to a northern city doctor with her third pregnancy a little over 3 years after the first birth.  This was in the early 1960's.   Uh huh.   Then they should lie to assholes like this about incipient testicular cancer to prevent them from breeding.   Here is another one. [This was hysterically funny.](http://i.imgur.com/eA2QeC0.jpg)  When they first made snowballs in the game the targeted toon would flip over onto it's back. Everyone loved them.   Also, as I discovered when my friends and I went to have a snowball fight on the SW/IF Tram, snowballs travelled at exactly the same speed as the tram. So the result was that once everyone got off the tram they would be hit by every snowball thrown at them during the ride.   BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM - the target would be doing flips in the air, totally stun-locked.  So we would lurk around the station, wait till some poor, unsuspecting player got on, get on the last tram car and start pelting snowballs at them. I'm laughing right now thinking about it.   Also we discovered that if you threw a snowball at a target at the moment they mounted a taxi bird, the snowballs would hit them as soon as they landed - anywhere.   And blizzard stopped it.. such a bummer.   I have a very strong suspicion that all of these new people Activision hired are people who have never actually been able to afford to play the game. Maybe in India or another code sweatshop type operation.    You reminded me of [this.](http://i.imgur.com/WkD6yNt.jpg).  My second toon I made a few months after beta -she ended up being a 19 twink and had her little rogue partner (usually my daughter or hubby at the helm of that one.)  Best story I have is;  "Back in the day, mages had unlimited sheeps on the battleground. You also had set battlegroups and would regularly play against the same players.  One day this Troll was speed hacking (a method where they would dc quickly/repeatedly and lag the game for other players) and we caught him alone in a hut on WSG. So I repeat sheeped his ass in the hut while my rogue partner stunlocked and killed everything that tried to come rescue him.   We laughed ourselves into hysterics.   Next time we encountered him we did the same thing. From then on out - until they changed the battlegroup system, it was game-on between me and him in every bg we ended up in together.    Leveled 3 100's. The rest of my alts I have locked at 90. Not going there. Unsubbing before my next pay date.   That's because old school players are accustomed to getting things like Ulduar, Firelands, new zones, Emerald Dream Dragons and Blackrock in a patch. Not selfie cameras.   Maybe he is a blizz employee.   I am not referring to the 'floating dead' aspect. I am referring to the lack of education, regulation and poverty that let's this continue.  Corporate/Banking groups (mostly multinationals now) are spending millions lobbying for low wages, ending the EPA, ending pollution regulations, ending work safety regulations, destroying what is left of labor power, ending supplemental health care, etc.  This is all part of the "Make gub'ment smaller!" movement.  The result of this, if they are successful, is exactly what you see in India and Bangladesh. Very few ultra rich at the top, wholly unregulated (who never see these streets) and masses of people in poverty.  EDIT: If you have an alternate point to make, man up and debate this instead of dv it.     Believe it or not- poor people in America are shitting in the streets now. They just haven't been doing it long enough yet to do it in the open.   Uh huh?   How about a debate?    Corporate/Banking groups (mostly multinationals now) are spending millions lobbying for low wages, ending the EPA, ending pollution regulations, ending work safety regulations, destroying what is left of labor power, ending supplemental health care, etc.  This is all part of the "Make gub'ment smaller!" movement.  The result of this, if they are successful, is the exactly what you see in India and Bangladesh.   Everything you said, and:  Second, ungate professions. Put fixed gem slots back on gear. Give us our enchants back. I don't understand why reforging, meta gems, and most enchant slots were removed. I LIKED having to invest some time and resources into my character. These days, getting gear is boring as hell.  I will add; "Slow Down", and reserve Heirloom gear to a few slots, like trinkets, gloves and belts.  Leveling speed and ease is ridiculous. Now there is no reason to level professions, because why bother to slot a gem or enchant or make a piece of gear you or your customer will only use for a couple of hours? This also means none of the made items can sell on the AH. When leveling and moving through new areas/dungeons was challenging, these items were important. Now you never die.  So now there is no reason to revisit old raids and dungeons where rare patterns drop. Or travel to different areas to farm materials, gain various faction rep for some recipes and make special items. That's a huge chunk of the game that is just gone.  I have 10 yr old toons with enchanting, alchemy, leatherworking, who have rare and very cool old school recipes that are now worthless. There was no reason to take this away from players- and it is a slap in the face of those who have invested time and money.   A few stacks of dynamite and a bic.    Go through the old patches from back in the day. Every few months brought major new content: http://www.wowwiki.com/Patches/1.x  At bottom of the page you can click on 2.x, 3.x etc to see those patches.    10 yr player. I already feel burned.    The farm was cute- but anti-social and had nothing personalized about it. Fixing just those two things and anchoring it in SW or IF (for ally) would have been awesome. For personalization you could get plaques with achieves or pics of some of your fav screenshots on the walls.    They did not give us exactly what we wanted. What we requested was the option to have a 'place' that we could bring others into; up to and including our guild members. That's all.   We didn't want mind numbing missions that virtual followers would go adventuring on. We wanted missions that our groups/guild would go adventuring on. We didn't want them to kill professions along the way, either.   Never did buy this. Wow is not a 'closed ended' game that you 'finish'. I remember we (me and my beta partners) deliberately took our time to level up- no rush. Why should there be? We wanted to explore - quest and see *everything* the game offered.   This whole 'people too busy now to play long time' is a fallacy that has led blizz to believe everyone needs to be able to lvl to max in a week, when we took months.    Content content content. This is why wow was exciting:  Patch 1.6.0  Blackwing Lair introduced  Darkmoon Faire introduced  Battlemasters introduced  Patch 1.8.0  Dragons of Nightmare - The four corrupted dragons from the Emerald Dream. (encouraging spontaneous 40 man groupings to kill them- and they were tough.)  Silithus - Totally revamped zone for level 60 solo players and 5-man parties.

Patch 6.1. ... barf ...       **Patch 3.1**  1. Ulduar  2. The full Argent Plaza and Argent Tournament  3. New ways of gaining reputation with capital cities.  4. All new daily quests, achievements and titles.  5. New rare and epic items, tabards, pets, banners, faction shirts and mounts.  6. Players level 40 and higher able to visit their trainer to pay a one-time fee (of 1,000Gold) and access the dual talent specialization feature.  **Patch 6.1.**   1. Selfie Camera.   *I have no idea how any player can support this bullshit*.      A lot of old school players, including myself, (after hitting 100 on a couple of toons) have locked their other alts at 90 and don't go to Draenor.   I'm the hahahaha person. I think it's all funny, regardless.   I'm fucking terrified. Nightmare material right there.      Geologist told me in 2001 that a side effect of climate change could be heating of sub-surface gasses, leading to an increase in volcanos and earthquakes. Been thinking about that lately.                           I came here to say just this. It was acting like an elderly scientist when I first entered. I kind of knew this was going to happen though as soon as Walmart started selling home computers.    Hope everything is ok. You in Oklahoma?   I have seen fresh cut wood in the Sierras the past two years that looked like it had been kiln seasoned- it was that dry. Fresh cut.    Many have been wondering why all these countries (including the US) have been militarizing police and doing home based 'Urban exercises' with the military.  I came to the conclusion that it had to do with future, climate related disasters a long time ago.   And here we are.    Another story http://www.dw.de/tornado-devastates-btzow-in-northern-germany/a-18430793      America is only awesome as long as we prevent the banks and corporations from impoverishing us to this point- while insisting the government provide safety nets.    "Hey lol (I'm hitting front page with this shit)"   12? Not cringe. 22? Serious cringe.     If you think about it- every new 'hate the poor' law so far this decade leads directly to this for everyone. I never remember growing up or in my 20s to 40's ever having an issue finding a public restroom. They were a matter of course. Now- everywhere- no public bathrooms? Ok.  This is the end result of that stupid bullshit.    This is why Jews have no moral qualms with running some of the most massive porn industries on earth. They use Goyim (non-jewish) women whom they are obligated to respect about as much as cattle.   The word 'Chick' is actually a derivative of very nasty word- it comes from Shiksa or 'prostitute'. It was first used for women in a movie directed and produced by a jewish film group. People have no idea.     I know someone who has been a registered sex offender for 10 years. His crime? Having sex with his 17 yr old girlfriend after he turned 21.   And the girlfriend started dating the prosecuting attorney and ended up marrying him a year after sentencing.   Meanwhile, the 'sex offender' can't get a job because it reads as 'rape of a minor'. They had been dating for over a year.    But I'm pretty sure they can be [tarred and feathered.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarring_and_feathering)    Tar and Feather= we need to bring this back big time.

Empathy for living things (I call it love) to a near pathological degree.    Flourishing? I am ready to start inventing recipes. Shrimp Chips, anyone?   I am not sure. This is a non co2, planted tank that has an Eco Complete substrate (20b) layered with some natural sand / dirt from the river out back (Sierra glacial stream) + fluorite (20lb).   ph 7. Other parameters good. Temp around 77-78. 10-15% water change once a week or so. I use a little flourish once a month + plant tabs at base of larger plants.   I have several different kinds of mosses- normal java moss, subwassertang and some mini fissidens that I got to attach to the castle roof.  They eat whatever they can scavenge plus 3 algae tabs 2-3x a week. Wardley Pleco tabs- aspirin sized ones.   The shrimp were a couple of baby hitchhikers that came in on a little bundle of plants. Took me a while to figure out where they came from.  Now I have a colony in my low tech 29 bowfront. Must have hitchhiked over when I was moving / trimming plants.   You are saying we torture animals because some people are egotistical, arrogant dumbasses.  Gotcha    The top line (8 degrees) is if we do nothing at all.  The other two values (2 and 4 degrees) are what we get with slowing and stopping carbon fuel burning combined with a massive, global geoengineering program to recapture CO2 using technology that hasn't been invented yet.   None of these take methane release due to melt or any other feedback mechanism into account.   I need a hug.        Absolutely. They should be cut out of the 21st century- onward- completely. How dare they think they can live like modern human beings?  Starbucks it is, friend.    It's not my 'assertion'. It's NASA's + many other studies combined. Check the video I posted.   Your post just gave me a flash remembrance of something I read decades ago. Just now looked it up and it is how I remembered it.    In Russia there comes the hope of the world, not as that sometimes termed of the communistic, or Bolshevik, no; but freedom, freedom! That each man will live for his fellow man! The principle has been born. It will take years for it to be crystallised, but out of Russia comes again the hope of the world. (1944) No. 3976-29 Edgar Cayce.  Now when he spoke this and even when I read it (in the 70's) Russia was the great evil on the earth.    I have noticed the ones that use that word the most are the ones who ultimately vote to keep the most unpatriotic things in place. With the GOP stacking congress/senate we are screwed.   This is the entire point to developing a fascist system. And it is exactly why they get entrenched and are hard to remove.   The whole 'bad women' and 'crazy feminists' stories started hitting about 6 months ago. Right about the time Hilary started hinting at a run for office. I believe it is deliberate astroturfing by GOP PR groups.    Zero growth rates are only a part of the equation. [Right now we are on track toward an 8 degree C warming.](https://youtu.be/8akSfOIsU2Y) That's a planet killer. Right now the 'survivable' 2 degree mark relies on development of a carbon sequestration technology that doesn't exist and isn't even being worked on by any scientific organization or country.    I think we should make them all use tin cans with string.  And we can take their drivers licenses and cars away. And make them wear flour sacks with a yellow 'P' (for Peon) sewn on so we can tell them from the real citizens. Then once they are completely castigated from the rest of society we can put them in labor camps.       All mosses can help with the nitrate cycle.

In this one the heater is under the substrate.   One option is to get a couple of java/marimo moss balls to keep in the tank. http://www.fishlore.com/fishforum/aquarium-plants/103662-what-point-moss-ball.html  It will help your tank re-cycle and in the future help prevent another crash if you lose power again.   It is wonderful to see goldfish in a proper environment. These guys have suffered from so much disinformation over the years it's mind boggling.   They are gorgeous.      Thank you Kate. I was wondering about that this morning.    So weird how the second the word 'nuclear' is in a post there are suddenly more comments than usual - pretty rapidly too.  I have actually tested this on long dead threads and seen an influx of nuclear supportive type comments within minutes.  You would think there was some kind of alert bot running on reddit.     Hi. The 'lacy' moss is plain Java moss tied on with cotton thread. By the time the cotton rots away the moss is imbedded on the driftwood. The little grassy plant is a micro sword.   The floating plants are common duckweed (Lemnia Minor) and Miniature Water Lettuce (Pistea). The water lettuce has the longer roots.   Red plant- as long as lighting and fert. requirements are met, Alternanthera Reineckii var. mini is nice. If it gets too big just trim it. I have the large type in the big tank. Another option is a mini Cryptocoryne. They tend to be more brown than red usually.  The thing with red plants is the proper fertilizer balance to maintain the color.   Also- none of my tanks have Co2. I cover them during the day with fitted plexiglass and run a light bubbler at night.    Thank you! I started working at it when I was 12. Started a couple of other businesses some years ago but I will always be a hobby keeper. It is living art.   http://i.imgur.com/Hg5aKMk.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/tqnl1nH.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/PjOAMN7.jpg   Anubias are low light plants. Even though some lights look bright to the human eye, the key for plants is the correct spectrum. This is also a very deep tank, which is going to make a big difference on your lighting needs.   Also Anubias don't need the correct strata for rooting.   If you want a planted tank, a few suggestions.  Make sure you have the correct base for them to root in.  Research lighting and apply it (could be a bit expensive).  Research fertilizers and apply. (also slightly expensive).  Don't keep soft plant eating fish if you want plants such as anacharis.   You can never add too many plants at once. Stock it up.   10 hours of lighting will lead to an algae nightmare. No more than 5 hours of correct spectrum lighting a day.   Otherwise you can stick with low light plants, such as anubias. Research low light plants if you plan on only having two tubes on the tank.   Definitely change out your bulbs for a plant spectrum bulbs, regardless.   Here's the deal with 'hungry' fish. Since they have to hunt for food most of their waking hours (in the wild) just to stay alive, they do not have a 'shut off' switch in their brain telling them that they are 'full' -like humans do. They don't need one.   Since you are artificially feeding them please ignore the begging if you know they are actually eating every day. Check bellies after dinner. Unfortunately, consistent food begging by fish has killed more than I like to think about.    Very pretty! Nice job. And bettas never hold still. Had to figure out high speed settings to take pics of my fish.   /u/msgreyson got it. One more thing with mystery deaths to check is cleaning products. Turn off filters before using heavily scented or odorous cleaning products, dust spray, bleach, ammonia, etc. Always make sure soap is rinsed off the hands before contact with tank water.    Do you have a water softener?  One thing you can do is add a very small piece of (dead and bleached) branching coral to the tank to add a bit more naturally dissolved calcium. About an inch per 10g. You can also add a level teaspoon of pure epsom salts per 20g. This can help with snails with thin shells as well. Just keep an eye on your ph.   Beautiful! Wonderful that you have given them a proper habitat.  I was working at Byerly's when these were first imported to the states. Back then only males in breeding mode would color that nicely.    Because people get mad when you fuck with their internal fantasy worlds? Ya thanks, was in the tropical/salt fish business for 30 yrs.   Bet you fed the guinea pig lettuce.   	198

Top sourcery   And he's just social-engineered you into acting a fool when you could have avoided it, had you known about social engineering.    You don't have to be funny all the time. I had this problem, always trying to think of a joke. It meant that interactions with people I like sometimes became awkward, or I was stuck in my head thinking of what to say next.   You don't need to crack a joke every time you speak. Relax your mind, roll with the conversation, focus on what the other person is actually saying and keep the conversation going with leading questions.  You'll find that opportunities for witticisms will present themselves.    How do you pronounce 'based'?  Is it like 'he was based in Seattle', or like 'bastard' said differently (bah-sed)?  I've never listened to Lil B so what does based god mean.    Joe Pesci as main chararcter.    TL;DR: Friend had mole, Peeps would troll, Threats on the doc, Surgery, Mole stop.   My friend had a mole on his face that he wanted removing. After 'Austin Powers: Goldmember' came out in 2002, people everywhere would point at his mole and say "...Moley, moley, mole." Strangers on the train, people outside the clubs, a taxi driver, his school friends. He used to get in fights about it on a Saturday. Some fella in the kebab shop, havin' it large with the lads. Gets a bit cocky waiting for his chips. Jumps up from his chair and spins to look at his crew. They all look up at him and he starts to point across the room at the mole, dancing a little jig towards my friend with his finger outstretched. More people start to look. Conversations stop. Silence in the kebab shop. One of the kebab dudes actually turned off the spinning meat cooker. Everyones looking at the pointing guy then he announces, "Minstrel." The roof blows off the kebab shop (yet to be found) and my friend has an unwanted nickname for the rest of his life. He said his mole wasn't as big as a Minstrel.   He got sick of the harassment so went to the doctor to get it removed. They said it wasn't dangerous, "we'll put you on the list." He asked them how long the list is. They said it was two years. He left the Doctor's surgery, mole intact, and tried to ignore the receptionist, who had taken the time to find the 'Goldmember' mole clip on YouTube and was now showing it to that dentist from the adjacent building.  He decided enough was enough and marched back into the doctor's office and explained that the mole was giving him hell and if they didn't operate immediately, he was going to whip it off himself. He maintains he would've. The doctor fast-tracked him to a senior surgeon and they had it off within the hour.  Now he's just a bloke with a scar on his face.    Chances are he'll be in a high-security wing away from people that want to kill him. Unless the screws turn a blind eye to child abusers.    Thanks for playing.

I just hoped there would be more soulful singing, but I guess this is just the refinement of his sound.   Edit: Accidentally a word   Good idea.   Hey, u/wedidthis, do you want to help me dispose of this dead hooker by digging the hole or holding the torch?   Those dudes just socially engineered you into apologising.    Thank you. Internet kisses x   Dude, this is crazy   explain please :)   Yes, and cyanide kills you by inhibiting those ATP things.    This sounds very interesting, I hope someone can shed some light on it for you!    Yes, and it's agreed.    That is pathetic.   	38
    Conrad was an unbelievably good person. Not only did he raise awareness of these atrocities, he also used satire to show up the do-gooders of his time who said they cared about Leopold's abuses in the Congo even though most of these people didn't consider the Africans fully human.   Another massive hero in bringing these killings to light was [E.D. Morel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._D._Morel) who was a shipping agent in Liverpool who figured out that something was wrong from inconsistencies in shipping manifests. He did some detective work and uncovered the mass killings.            Thanks. Blackwater/XE or whatever name they go by now is insanely creepy. It's like an independent kingdom with its own warlord and mercenary army. I think any connection to the hijackers from 911 is disconcerting in the extreme.   Imagine all these lizard people turning on one another. It would be like Godzilla vs Gamera in a fight to the death.      That is truly astonishing. Can this be verified as a real document? Not much shocks me anymore, but if this is real, I am seriously shocked. It's like a worm hole inside the rabbit hole.   This is bullshit. Sepp Blatter and FIFA? Somke kid with a website where people sell weed? Why don't the so called authorities go after some real criminals like the ones who crashed the economy?      How many of these sick fuckers are there? Maybe at this point it would just be easier and quicker if we compiled a list of the few people in power who don't like to have sex with children?    Yes for public logs   Astonishing fact I learned recently: the majority of rape victims in the US every year are male. This is due to the rape epidemic in the prison system and in the military both of which affect men more than women.      It's pretty pervasive and international, but I think there are still a few decent people even in government. Otherwise we would never hear about any of this.   But those types of users tend to have newer accounts. Voat doesn't let people vote down until they've had 100 upvotes. It seems like that must be harder to game. Reddit in comparison is still pretty easy to manipulate.   That sounds reasonable. As long as restrictions are transparent and evenly applied. In this case, there's no arbitrary decision for mods to make. Same rule applies to everyone. I don't see the problem.      I don't know about the comment, but it sounds like he was talking about the Franklin Coverup in Nebraska, and the Presidio case with Col Aquino in the case of the military base. England might be the ongoing parliamentary investigation into fallout from Jimmy Savile and other people in entertainment and in politics who have been outed as pedophiles.

A great place to learn about his life and the terrible treatment he received is: [johnallegro.org](http://www.johnallegro.org/)  Allegro's books themselves first of all because they are mindblowing. Here's a PDF of his: [Sacred Mushroom and the Cross](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=71B938446A8AF6363AF73D19876AFE40) Also the Dead Sea Scrolls is an excellent read. His conclusions about Christianity are radical and highly controversial but backed up by his philological mastery. He believes that Christianity formed out of a cult that used hallucinogens, in particular the fly agaric mushroom. He makes a wild case for this with the original language of the Gospels.    I get all my news from the US military, don't you worry about that.   That is fucking wild. Hats off to the Yemenis. The planet needs way more of this shit.   While I find Jan Irvin a bit hit and miss, anyone who supports John Allegro is fine in my books. Allegro was an absolute genius who was destroyed by some very powerful people owing to his conclusions about early Christianity formed while working on the Dead Sea scrolls. He was a MAJOR scholar of ancient religion and language who was demonized and broken. Everyone on this sub should know about his story, this is the archetype of a conspiracy. I'll definitely listen to this.         Because Google isn't creepy enough already.         And just came across this while I was looking for another conspiracy I half remember from Australia: [Nazi pedophile ring in Australia](https://independentaustralia.net/life/life-display/trapped-inside-australias-vast-child-abuse-network-part-1,6460)   American Buddha is good. He's been around forever and has a huge index of weird books on esoteric and radical topics. He's out of the goofy sixties underground which tends to be pretty reliable. The sources are cited in the article like Victor Marchetti who wrote a classic text exposing the CIA. Their involvement is really well established but info on recent decades is very hard to come by. Info was more freely available thirty or forty years ago, ironically!   This guy really seems like a hero.   Try this: [CIA in Australia](http://www.american-buddha.com/cia.australia.htm)      I really appreciated your use of bullet points. It made your argument both clear and presentable. Well done.               That's good to know. I think I stated that wrong. Apple cider vinegar was used by Greek protestors to prevent breathing in tear gas. They would soak bandanas and apparently it helped to prevent getting any tear gas breathed in.         Censor this Ellen.      Fuck Ellen Pao.   Now that is one funky looking mushroom. I may look into this.      I can attest to this. Very good thing to start taking. I've also used a couple of drops in my Neti pot to absolutely cure sinusitis. It's supposed to be the best antidote to tear gas though I haven't tested that out. Everyone should be taking this stuff.            Yes but it would be nice if you could actually comment on this specific article.   Can't see anything wrong with that. Why not read the article and then comment on the specifics of what they're saying about Obama's policies? Counterpunch is always well argued. Give a good argument back if you disagree with what they're saying.   I've been reading it for years and basically consider it left wing libertarian, but mostly they're iconoclasts.   I grew up in DC and was around a lot of people at the top of the food chain earlier in life. They are usually really smart but incredibly unquestioning. It's a weird combination that you'll find is very prevalent at Ivy League schools. There's an almost cult like aspect to their failure to ever question whatever echo chamber they happen to be in. In my opinion, the smartest people don't tend to get a sniff at the higher levels of power unless they have a degree of sociopathy about them. People with a high emotional IQ don't get anywhere near those jobs. They don't usually get into Harvard or Yale. Really brilliant people from STEM backgrounds might climb the ladder within a think tank or NASA or some research facility but they'll hit the wall at a certain point when politics comes into play especially regarding getting funded.      Expect a few shills on this. Big Pharma needs to be covered a lot more on this sub. Here's a good documentary that gives an intro to the history behind the modern medical establishment: [Origins of Medical Industry Corruption ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheKUW6kGuY)   Please take them! Just leave us Neil Young and we're good.      That movie Source Code felt like someone was using predictive programming to prepare the audience for an attack on Chicago. Or maybe the shadow government gets inspiration for its black ops from these stupid movies.    Sadly, we are still fighting those battles, whether here in the USA in Ferguson or Baltimore, or in Gaza or the Negev, wherever the oppressed need us to raise our voices unafraid.  We need to stand shoulder to shoulder with them, our brothers and sisters, until true equality and justice are won.   Interesting point here. Maybe other countries should consider a cultural boycott of the US until we get our shit together? If the Canadians ever pull out, our entertainment industry is fucked.         This absolutely scares the living shit out of me like nothing else I've read on this sub. People have no idea what's about to happen to them.      The British public has done pretty damn well over the years with revolts. Look up the Poll Tax riots for a good recent example. Weapons aren't as important in revolt as will.      Britain and Canada are increasingly following the American model in treating their citizens as criminals in need of constant monitoring. Irish people in the UK already went through this process back in the 70s, then it calmed down a bit and seems to be coming back with a vengeance targeting not only Muslims but also anyone outside mainstream politics.   Great quote from him: "I'm into science policy." Bet that works as a terrific chat up line in the  bars.      I've come to the conclusion that it's way more important to vote in local elections. Town council seats can be decided by dozens of votes and have a massive effect on how local communities are able to live. We have no say with the big stuff unless we organize at street level.            Shouldn't there be a distinction between skeptic and debunker? I'm paranoid by nature and thus skeptical of everything but most of all debunkers. Popular Mechanics, I'm looking at you.   Fair enough, but I think those misdeeds do shed some light on the culture these people grew up in which is extremely elitist.   I'm reading a good book on him now by Gary Lachman. I don't think Crowley was evil but I do think he was more damaged than the average mystic and I don't trust him. He's fascinating, but at the same time he makes me suspicious of his motives.  And while it may well be nonsense, is the Bush stuff really so crazy? I mean she looks JUST like him.   Exactly. War is about the people who already have more money than they know what to do with. They want toys. Instead of toy soldiers and model planes and tanks, they get to use the real thing. Just listen to how flushed and excited they get when they go on their stupid jaunts where the general shows off the latest gadgets. People who want to enter the highest levels of power all get addicted to the feeling of being able to use real people as playthings.   The irony is that the times I've received abuse have been outside this sub. This place has been relatively civil, but I'm sure the people coming up with these rules have us in their cross hairs.   Thanks. Interesting article. I'm still blown away by the interaction between American companies and Germany after the war started in Europe. Chemicals and pharmaceuticals, banking, information management systems, everything. We helped them a great deal well into the war.   While the Independent is right that the Rothschilds didn't make a killing on the stock market in the hours after Waterloo, they massively benefited from the economic downturn that followed it due to the winding down of the wartime economy. They were very wealthy before Waterloo and stratospherically wealthy after. This is similar to the way people like the Rockefellers benefitted from the stock market crash in 1929 by being the only ones with capital who could buy up basically sound companies that were faltering because of temporary liquidity problems. Capitalism makes these excesses inevitable and always leads to economic/political elites.   I get that, but it also means he has broken some serious federal laws and shouldn't be able to influence American elections to the extent that he does.   I posted this article because I found it interesting. If you want to see those articles, then go find them and post them. I will very happily read them.    What tip?   I largely agree with you though think it might just be possible. It only matters in so far as it shows the weird kind of synchronicities that happen when looking at elites. I'd be more freaked out if the Bush's had a genetic connection to Ayn Rand.   Brazil sounds fucking amazing.   That's awesome.  	92
 Try this forum thread out...  http://www.hearingaidforums.com/showthread.php?15640-Costco-Kirkland-Signature-5-0   Don't enjoy intoxication myself; can't really stand being around intoxicated people.   I think you meant to say, on a private test track in an unknown location, no?   Don't forget to update your flair!  Welcome one and all!   I meant it as a general suggestion, not necessarily for you specifically. Too many 86s have been wrapped around trees by wannabe Paul Walkers not familiar with the dynamics of RWD platforms.   Comparisons on car pricing among different countries are fallacious at best.  Tariffs can vary wildly depending on country of origin.  To say nothing of currency valuation, as you noted.  And then you have market pricing, import quantity, etc. etc.  And neither of our countries are the country of origin for the platform in this case.   It only comes on the BRZ Limited standard; it is an option on the Premium.  The FR-S has an entirely different spoiler (optional 2013 and 2014 base, standard 2014 Monogram, optional 2015 base).  The Release Series 1.0 2015 has a standard spoiler that is a three piece lip design, totally different from all other models in the US.    OP is a Canadian ;)  It'd be more of a joke if s/he didn't have winter tires.   "Upcoming" is pretty open-ended.  When the 6S comes out Fall 2015 I'm sure the 5s will be free or $1; ditto when the 7 comes out in Fall 2016 regarding the 6.  :)   Yes, on an engine designed for high octane, when you use lower octane, you get less performance.  I said exactly that.  It won't hurt anything, however, which was my main point.   No one's sure really but when you let the clutch it faster you'll find it doesn't do it as much/at all.  But obviously that it didn't do it in the beginning means something is changing in the transmission and/or clutch.   First thing you should do after getting a twin is learn how to drive it so you don't have an unfortunate accident as many people new to sports cars tend to do.   The RS 1.0 has a body kit, lowering springs and an axleback exhaust (i.e. different muffler).  There are some other minor interior appearance things but really, that's about it.  The engine and transmission are identical to every other FR-S/BRZ.   It will adjust its timing for running on lower quality gas - all cars do that.  Unless you run a tune that truly requires a specific octane, all you will get from lower octane gas is lower performance.   The Mustang and Miata are "equally good"?  Say, wha?  If you really think that please get a Mustang as the point of a Miata or an FR-S/BRZ is in no way the same as a Mustang, aside from the moving from Pt. A to Pt. B thing.   Nope, it happens when shifting too slowly (well, releasing the clutch too slowly).  Cars like being shifted fast, it's actually less stressful as everything is closer to matching speeds.   That's this sound.  http://www.ft86club.com/forums/showthread.php?t=19308  I don't think anyone is certain what it is yet, but the clutch being the thing that makes it is pretty certain.   Have a look at this chart:  http://www.ft86club.com/forums/showpost.php?p=238340 postcount=2   The crickets from the fuel pump and the AC chirp are separate things - one doesn't cause the other.  The fuel pump will be basically constant once warmed up - the AC is a periodic chirp/squeak that happens every 7-10 seconds when the AC is on or the windshield defrost is on.   I thought the discount was only live until the phone is paid for completely?   There are two chirps your car will make.  One is the high pressure fuel pump, which will be a near constant chirp/squeak once warmed up and we call crickets.  The other is the AC compressor which will chirp every 10 seconds or so when the AC is on (or front window defrost is on, as the AC is running then as well).  Both are totally normal.   My suggestion exactly - same on all sides and back, nothing on front.  35% is plenty dark for Nebraska.   Heh, yep.  Good people share this sort of info over on NASIOC ;)   Well my theory originally was to run the LWCP until I could afford a nice clutch/LWFW and tearing into the transmission.  However just recently a member started a survey thread about running both pulley and flywheel and there are plenty of folks who do without problem.  It's likely a combination of other mods like FI contributed to the problem, as well as being a holdover from other Subie engines (where it really was a bad thing to do).  http://www.ft86club.com/forums/poll.php?do=showresults pollid=956   Well I mean when my lease is up I'll have the option to keep it or turn it in.  Just haven't decided yet.  Obviously I've got a while to figure it out.  This is my car: http://www.ft86club.com/forums/showthread.php?t=67902   Yeah, what I've been wrestling with turning the FR-S in in 2017 when my lease is up or keeping it.  I am hoping to buy a new house in 2018 if not sooner so it's a lot to think about.    They'll do for now.  Working on a 2017 plan.  Need to be good for a while.  :)   A Tundra, at the time.  Since then I've also had a Mercedes C350, a GMC Sierra 1500, a different Tundra and now my FR-S and my girlfriend's Hyundai Sonata.  And three different motorcycles.  And a Focus, Taurus and Corolla that were all driven by my ex-fiancee (that breakup was why the first Tundra went away as well...memories).  So yeah, I have a problem with buying vehicles heh.  I keep motorcycles the longest, till they're paid.  The GTO I owned the longest, not quite four years.  Then the first Tundra right about three.   Nope, disagree.  I did my research on all seasons and for the little bit of snow we get here they're ideal.  I bought the highest all-around performing all seasons as tested by Tire Rack - Hankook ventus s1 noble2s.  Working great.  Better than the stock summers in the dry as well.  I may get dedicated snows out in the future but these will more than meet my needs this season.  Especially given my ability to telework.   Zero hour...Nine AM.

I also kept breaking it, well, little reliability problems here and there that just annoyed for it being my only four wheeled vehicle.   I sold her back in 08; recently saw her back for sale again when I was at my old home on business.  Mod wise she had a roots supercharger (Magnacharger) with a two size down pulley, ported and polished throttle body, carbon fiber intake, gauge pod and taillights imported from Oz, full exhaust (JBA shorties and high flow cats, custom catback), built torque converter, spoiler delete, carbon fiber hood for a bit (because stocker was damaged by some jerk's hitch at work), 05+ rear conversion, and custom tuning by Magnaflow (by their chief engineer in their dyno cell).  The last time it was on the dyno with me it was over 480whp, but that was before the intake and TB work. Through the 4L60E it was just over 600bhp.     [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Ey7CMCE.jpg)   I figured the strut clearance thing would be an issue given the springs vice coilovers...I think most folks running that wheel are on coilovers.  Also I wasn't talking about the poke (how far the wheel sticks out) but stretch (how the tire doesn't go all the way to the edge of the rim).  I ran 245s on 8 inch wide rims on my GTO back in the day.  Enjoy your ride :)   That's funny - I just read through your build yesterday.  I like the new wheels.  I would've gone with narrower (or wider tires) as I'm not a big fan of the stretched look, but to each their own.   This makes me sick, and incredibly sad.

That said, as soon as more Raw camera apps are available the choice for Lollipop will be..well, it won't be a choice.   I've got an OFT as well but just a track pipe as far as exhaust goes.  Intake pipe, filter, strut bar, master cylinder brace, lithium battery, spare tire deleted and different tires are about the size of it for me right now.  Lighter is better if my philosophy though I'm not a weight Nazi.   Run it empty, fill up, flash tune.  Details abound on ft86club.   What's your full exhaust configuration?  Also, any tuning?

 good point about space operas being expensive   hmmmm westworld   hmmm, westworld   but maddaddam is like a dystopian future show theres enough of those on tv already im talking a space opera, with spaceships, aliens, battles, and evil badguys, and maybe an empire too   or sci-fi shows period, i dont care what its about, instead its like "oh you need a GOT fix and that movie you didnt see in the theater, but still want to see plays next month, well instead heres some more guilt exploiting documentaries about global warming, and homophobia, and AIDS themed miniseries, because we need more emmys and golden globes and youll nominate them because youll feel like a huge jackass if you dont!! because THATS how we do it!." i mean seriously i mean global warming and all that stuff is a serious issue but whoever owns HBO right now if youre reading this, please consider a sci-fi show (preferably space opera), thank you.   you don't call them she, and they're not male   they lie and lie and lie and LIE, like recently there was an article on why beinga movie buff ruins your life, and i say whoever wrote that article YOURE EVIL AND I HATE YOU being a movie buff is great!!!!!!! theres just liars and liars and more liars, they ruin EVERYTHING about cinema, and they should be launched into space into the sun!!! anyone who disagrees please state why now, thank you   Dora the Explorer spanish      if john munch appeared   this episode taught me that 'cannoli' can be plural AND singular apparently   touche   i mean seriously, i watch the show and reddit is bombarded with bitching, whining, nitpicking little babies, that dont find a thing to their liking. the show is like an awesome vacation spot, and reddit after the episodes is like coming back home finding out your hometown is overrun by zombies that wanna kill you, imagine that each and every week!! its miserable is what im trying to say   how many awards have YOU won, hmmmmm?   hellraiser was cool, but thats not what im asking, im asking who you think doug JONES can play   i'm not talking about andy serkis (don't get me wrong i like his work but) im talking about DOUG JONES, so who do you think he should play?   the first movie was decent, so i guess i can check it out,    the question is which character? id prefer if he'd play a pokemon and i have a good idea which one, can you guess? heres some links to both help you out, and to let you know who im talking about:  http://imgur.com/gallery/h8A09QY  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMVJnWd4idE   im so fucking sick of transformers comparisons id rather commit suicide if i hear it ONE MORE TIME!!   yes i have and i like the new movies, and quit judging people!   I like mystery men, I only watched the first 20 minutes of bowfinger (I watched GOLDfinger though) bowfinger seemed pretty funny though   Hes won nearly 20 awards though,   Benedict is a good actor though   Persecution complex you say? You may be on to something.   how do you keep finding me?   oh christ your one of those people who say 'nutrek', thats like a trend that shouldve passed in 2011, its hopeless, ill never have a civil discussion about ''nutrek'' as you call it. theres just no hope   see this is what i never understood, i have zero complaints about a movie, but its made hard to enjoy because people keep pointing out the flaws, like going out to get gourmet chocolate pudding with friends and enjoying it, and then you hear the people you were with at the time complain about it either looking like a doggie doodie, or not being flavored to their liking? it wears you down  EDIT: btw this isnt grammar class i can type stuff however i please   but why cant i have an opinion? :(   without being seen as a bully, i mean i like them and no one can take that away, people can complain about them not being made to their liking, or the classic "they dont follow genes vision" excuse but we have the franchise back and thats something that a sci fi fan can appreciate. also i think we should give bob orci a chance, i mean think about it, the new movies got rave reviews, and we have 2 new movies already i wanna know what dont people like about the new movies, and ill share why i like them, and i like them because they bring life into this franchise with these talented actors in beautiful action packed fight scenes. and thats why i like them, and now why cant i have that opinion i ask? explain why, itll give me clarity to this kerfuffel  EDIT: i swear to god if i hear ONE MORE COMPARISON TO TRANSFORMERS ill flip a shit!!      FOR FUCKS SAKE!!! were only like 3 episodes into the show people!! 91% on rotten tomatoes dont come from fucking review fairies!!! like you think bruno heller made a wish one day and was like,"starlight starbright and all that shit, i wish my new show had a good tomatometer rating!"? reviews come from critics with age and experience!!!    ok so i CLEARLY implied that im sick of hearing those words. How to you did that translate to "give it a try ill, like that very much" explain to me please   you know what im done talking to you, go piss someone else off i dont have time for you, what about YOUR mother knowing what you do on the internet? i am looking forward to episode 7 and i think jj abrams is the right man for the job, no further discussion is required!!!! so stfu go bother someone else, i bet your mother is very proud of you!   I don't have time or punctuations, and my mother loves me very much   ok the answers to your questions is because YOU SUCK!!! there all done, well its been real see ya around, adios!   oh god SHUT UP ill have to report you for harassment!!   i asked for advice to deal with assholes not INVITE any. also i think jj abrams is a great director and will make a great star wars!!!!    maybe i seem to notice the nitpicking more, its like an overpowering sauce in a soup it takes away the flavor   im fucking sick of it!! especially when people complain that they arent 'subtle' if they werent subtle how would you know what villains they were? subtlety sucks!!! thats how the show is DEAL WITH IT!! either start accepting that or stop watching it! hell im still amazed my sister still claims shes into harry potter but nitpicks about it any chance she gets. same thing with star wars fans or trekkers. i swear to god if i hear ONE MORE TIME about the fucking villain name dropping im gonna LOSE MY SHIT!!! you cant stop people liking a tv show. i swear the people who criticize this show are the worst!   that isnt what i asked!   FUCK OFF!!! He's great!!! Are you TheSolarSailor by any chance?   badly   i thought i WAS being the bigger man  EDIT: besides if i didnt call them out how will they know hes causing people misery and know when to stop?   Because I don't have an imdb account of my own, and God help if I get an intelligent answer there   Because man there are so many users on imdb like TheSolarSailor, he SAYS he doesn't care about Star Wars or Star Trek but CONSTANTLY picks on people of they like it especially episode 7, he even said he's looking forward to picking on all the disappointed people when it comes out. TheSolarSailor if you're reading this I HATE YOU Motherfucker! People like you give movie buffs a bad name. There's gonna be Star Wars fans whether you like it or not!!!! If anyone has advice either for me or TheSolarSailor don't hesitate to give it, thank you! At the very least at least tell TheSolarSailor to stop being an asshole.   That titles reminds me o that part in that Ed, edd, n eddy episode where they make that city in the alley out of cardboard boxes. And at one point Ed says "I was the balloon guy"   I thought it was just fine they've just fallen under the haters spell.  EDIT:ok maybe I overeacted a little    Cmon people!!! This is a subreddit for Gotham but you still make fun of it?!? How is that possible?!? And don't downvote me for liking the show that started this subreddit!   i mean its like the world is trying to convince me that "you are not allowed to like this show, people wont like you for it!" type of thing, and its like the rave reviews dont come from review fairies people!! (bruno heller: i wish my new show had rave reviews. Fairie: your wish has been granted) theyre from all natural real human persons!!! i hate what i hear from you people "its bad because theres no batman" "some actors arent the right age" i mean its bad enough that there are people who dislike the marvel universe movies (and i avoid them as much as possible, and if i DO come across them, they make an enemy for life.) am i bad for liking a show? i swear to god if i hear ONE MORE TIME it doesnt meet your petty expectations or there's too many Easter eggs or too many cameos there'll be HELL TO PAY and you'll make an enemy FOR LIFE!! if anyone has a good reason why i should or shouldnt like gotham, dont hesitate to explain why. thank you  EDIT:dear god, why do i keep asking for permission to like stuff i should know better by now, I'm probably better of binging my money and time on booze  	49
                         great responsibility    I hope he can do some justice, even if it a minor script it will have the Kubrick tag on it         the holocaust?    Pavlova tastes better to me after a few days.   What terrible responses largely   OP has point, majorly, not supposed to be used like that yet many people still do.       Do they normally like hats?   LOL   What a handsome dog   What type of dog is that?   If the money is there for it they might.          Too many kids you mean. I don't see dad jokes at all.    Bambi   Dark Knight   Sure, but there is divisions, such as chick-lit, and when discussion on the paper literature means literary works normally.    When you have 10 copies to get out before lunch minor mistakes over ancient mythos in comic books are not that important. You gave one example about dc and gay green lantern but are there others? Or is that the only fault in the thing?   I was not wrong. The article explains it all. It says 2011. In fact every point made against it was in the article   So I am right. I knew I was.   I didn't downvote you, but don't whine about bullying on reddit  That is more bullying.    Yes people have said this and I said you are complaining about a title when you don't read the article which says all of this. It is just bullying.    I just really like first movie a lot    What is misleading about it? I am confused. I am being downvoted. I have shown the link which states that it was only yesterday that he was officially confirmed. You are the 5th person at least to say this and every time I say yes he has been here since 2011 but only officially confirmed as the new spiderman for the new universe http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/marvel-inclusion-biracial-spider-man-article-1.2265591 I didn't want link them as find them tabloidy  now downvote for asking why I am so wrong   You got some links to that one?   Money, which is my normal answer   Manspreading    6 years.   When he left.   magic beans   I am error   Yes the article says that. It also says  yesterday, officially announced by writer as being the new spiderman. This is the news. I am confused why people don't understand that. I have said it many times. This news is from yesterday.    Right now comic book fans.   Some say Matrix sequels. Others say Godfather. I say Robocop.   Yes and everytime I explain to them that it came out officially yesterday. The writer confirmed it yesterday. Sorry but you are wrong. This announcement officially came out yesterday. It is a fact that cannot be argued. And it is sad that you are trying because you only read the headline.    No the news was officially announced yesterday. I already pasted the passage and the link is in the article. This is a fact. This is undeniable and you are just being desperate now because someone called you out on not actually reading it. I posted it in comicbooks too.   It would be great if they could afford a comic book journalist on the payroll but with the way things are in the paper business impossible. The journalist is very knowledgeable about literature but comics are a different subject   I did, you wrote "Even though they state that he has been out since 2011, the articile is misleading."  When in fact if you read the entire article it clearly explains that it was only confirmed yesterday he is due to become the *official Spider-Man*    You didn't, because your comments completely missed the main point of the article. I'll lay it out for you - Behind the times? The news came out *yesterday.*         I think she is not a comic book person Ms. Flood   What is wrong with it?  I have been downvoted almost 100 times because of an article I did not write which actually states nearly every single answer to the comments made here complaining about it. It answers all the things in it.   So the writer of it officially confirming this news is not news at all? That makes no sense.   Morales, who has an African American father and a Puerto Rican mother, has worn the Spider-Man suit since 2011 in Marvels offshoot Ultimate Universe line, set in an alternate reality where Peter Parker died. **Writer Brian Bendis confirmed to the New York Daily News on Sunday that he is due to become the official Spider-Man from this autumn**, with an adult Peter Parker as his mentor.  I said read the article, not just the first paragraph.  Why downvote this? I am right. Person did not read the article only the headline. The news is that. It was announced yesterday.   So this is brigading is it. My first I think.   [There will be blood](http://media.giphy.com/media/oKIivZsxoveRa/giphy.gif)   Read the article please. Thx   It was confirmed yesterday. Still fairly breaking.   I don't know, to get people to read, or maybe referencing the official nature of the new Spiderman    Morales, who has an African American father and a Puerto Rican mother, has worn the Spider-Man suit since 2011 in Marvels offshoot Ultimate Universe line, set in an alternate reality where Peter Parker died. Writer Brian Bendis confirmed to the New York Daily News on Sunday that he is due to become the official Spider-Man from this autumn, with an adult Peter Parker as his mentor.  Does anyone else hate people that don't even read the article they bitch about?                  I haven't seen the movie               I aged three weeks just this morning                               No better man.      Be dead soon so don't worry      and that makes it ok?  The amount of edgy scum cunts in this thread. I didn't know there were so many teenagers on reddit.         The fact Jim Crace just won the Impac award has 3 upvotes. It was posted about an hour earlier than this.                   The Government wants to look progressive. They can stop it.      It is primarily 1 I think from the responses.      What is wrong with exorcisms?    The long history of dog and humans and the fact that some people do consume them as food is confusing to you?  You are trying to be clever with the wrong person. I see through stupidity quite easily.    So? No one argued that. Read the article or at least the comments or shut up.   Dogs have a long history with humans. Far more complex than any other animal. Anthropological, genetic, hormonal studies connect us.   I'm getting very pissed off at people thinking they are being clever by saying these stupid comments. No one would want to see a pig treated like that either. Or any animal.     Thank you. Why people are downvoting the post I can't understand.                      I remember this.                  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015WR017349/full paper            Paper http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015WR017349/full            Robert Sheehan will step in now.

 Miss-terious   I'm a detention officer at the maximum security jail. 36k a year 600 saved but I'm about to buy a new gun.. sooo... nothing saved. Lol   Lol no you fucking retard. I'm saying that mat 90 is not a pre-requisite for any education degree...or any degree.. it's only because you fucked up on your assessment test.   No.. it is not..   MAT 90 is because the student didn't do well on the assessment test. College level math starts at 101. Students interested in teaching, and any degree really, are required to take math classes to a certain point to satisfy their general requirements.   When they go to their program of study, in this case education, they will take other classes that focus on how to teach it among other things.  Here is an education major at a university in my city. This is the math requirements for a degree in their program:  MAT-150 Mathematics for Elementary Teachers I This is the first in a two-course sequence designed for prospective elementary school teachers. Concepts include set theory, functions, numeration systems, number theory and properties of the natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, ratios, proportions, decimals, and percents, with an emphasis on problem solving and critical thinking. Prerequisites: Grade of C or better in MAT 134 or 3 years of high school algebra with a grade of C or better. 4 MAT-151 Mathematics for Elementary Teachers II This is the second in a two-course sequence designed for prospective elementary school teachers. Concepts of elementary probability, data analysis, descriptive statistics, geometry of shapes in two and three dimensions, congruence and similarity, measurement, and geometric transformations, with an emphasis on problem solving and critical thinking. Prerequisite: MAT 150. 4 MAT-250 College Algebra and Trigonometry This course is a unified study of fundamental concepts from algebra and trigonometry that provide the necessary background for the study of calculus. Topics include modeling linear equations and inequalities; functions and their graphs; polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions; systems of equations and inequalities; matrices and determinants; and conic sections. There is an emphasis on developing both a fundamental understanding of these concepts as well as their application to real-world problem solving. Prerequisites: Grade of C or better in MAT 134 or 3 years of high school algebra with a grade of C or better.   Math 90....  Good for you...   Big 10 Title incoming!   Diamonds... she'll pretty much "have to"   You'll probably never top that game in your lifetime! lol    In my line of work we call this "racial tension" and get our tasers and pepper spray ready with a smile Lol     Maybe you should change your name?   I vote OP bring some Lafayette Coney Island or at the very least some white castle with him!   I started sleeping on the couch because of those stupid bed sheets.  You win bed..you win!   his name is officer gooch....  lolz.   Best comment:  Keyser Sze 1 hour ago I would buy two mobile homes from that brunette. Then make stains in both of them with her.   I love hockey. My favorite sport.. I am curious to know who he is :)   The heart   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJzwAswDzns feature=youtube_gdata_player  	17
 I read it a few years ago. I was just completely blown away by it. The writing style is amazing especially the focalisation on the main character. I loved how the novel captures the grey area of morality in modern society.    My high school philosophy teacher gave me the myth of Sisyphus at a dark time in my life. It was a very interesting book. Since then I've read a few others including the stranger. I would recommend reading the collection of Camus's notebooks.    I think 14 is a good age to read that book. Its around those years which you begin to consider the depths of morality. I found the book enthralling and I still enjoy it. Though I read The Great Gatsby  at 18, and all though I found it to be well written, the themes and messages were things I had already considered through other media. Of course this shows the impact of the novel on society, I'm just saying that some of those novels written in a different time or place are more significant at younger ages.    Thank you for the time you invested in writing this post. I appreciate the advice very much.  I agree with you wholeheartedly! Especially concerning skepticism when it comes to the kindness of friends opinions. I do want to one day be a great writer. I think I just have to learn to stay on the self assessment side, because being a defeatist will get me nowhere.    I have, it's quite heavy, but it certainly opened my eyes to a side of philosophy that i had not previously considered.   	5

The internet is right.   Growing up, I was a pretty typical 90s kid in America. I loved playing outside, whether it's sports or playing in a creek, but I also loved playing video games with friends and especially playing against them in Pokemon. Days would wisp by as a child, with no cares in the world other than my family, friends, and video games. I had a few close friends in the neighborhood I grew up around, even the one kid who was a little younger that had lived in the borderline condemnable house, well call him Jack. A house with plain-sight cracks to foundation, old, dingy siding hanging off partial tears from the wall, and almost every window how some extent of damage to it. He didnt have much, but he had us, his friends. He would be ecstatic to come over for dinner and video games, as he didnt get the greatest of either at home. A small part of me as a child felt empathy, but he was such a good friend that it would always be overlooked that he is poor, he was one of us. Jack was an integral part of the small circle of neighborhood kids we had created over the years.    One curious thing about Jack is that, although he was older, he seemed to be failing at aging, if at all. We were always told as kids that he had some complicated disorder that made him LOOK that way, but he always seemed wise beyond his years. He would always give advice that youd want to hear from an adult figure like an adult brother, but not quite a parent. The type of advice that was right, but wasnt coming from an authority figure like a parent, so you would actually TRY to listen to them.  Sometimes, he would say weird things and would immediately apologize, saying that he slipped. We never saw him fall, but he would always tell us he slipped. I remember him doing this quite often, and one time in particular, made me relatively uneasy.   Now we were all close friends, a small family if you will, so what Jack did this day was completely unexpected. As we were playing around tossing a football amongst each other, Jack just started shaking his head. It was a slow shake, until he looked down and started shaking his head in a more rapid manner. We all immediately cease what we were doing to help him, but it was already lost at this point. His head is furiously shaking, while he clutches his hair, to the point we thought he would rip it right from his scalp. It was this moment I will never forget, it turned my life upside down and inside out. It still affects me as I write this. In that moment, Jack stopped shaking, he looked at all of us with a look weve never seen, this wasnt Jack anymoreit looked like Jack aged 15 years in that 30 second time frame.     STOP THIS RIGHT NOW! IM DONE, ITS OVER! WAKE THE FUCK UP! Jack shouted, in a sad, but angry tone. I chime in after the dust of shock settled. S-stop what Jack? We were only tossing a football I was still shaking as Jacks voice rattled each and every one of us to the core. I saidWAKE THE FUCK UP TIM! Jack rattled again, this time directed right at me. I am now terrified of what is coming or, what may have already happen. I am enveloped by the emotional cocktail of fear, sadness, angst, and even anger. What are you talking about Jack, Im right here in front of you, wide awake, just like every day. Do you want me to get your Mom, or mine, or Tylers? I questioned him, still shaking in emotion. No Tim, I want you to wake up. I cant live here any longer, I want to grow up again. He replied, with tears welling up in his eyes. Im scared Jack, what are you talking about?? I said, completely enveloped by fear at this moment. Jacks knees became weak as he crippled to the ground, overcome with emotion, he seems angry but he is full on crying. After a few moments, he managed to mutter out a few words.     Thisnone of this is real Timmy. I hurt you, I hurt you bad. You wont wake up, and all I want you to do is wake up. I want to apologize to the real you.     In this moment, I was frozen. Not paralyzed, more so frozen in complete terror.  Out of nowhere, my head feels as if it was an overinflated balloon ready to pop. Writhing in pain a get a few words out to Jack, Whats.happening. My head, its going to explode! Jacks head perks up, with his eyes wide open now, he wipes away the tears and starts looking around. As the pain finally subsides after what seemed to be hours, I notice something odd. Everyoneeverything is gone except Jack and myself. Dead silence, I feel nothing, no emotion, no painnothing. It appeared that Jack had the same feeling take over him.     I tried Timmy, I really did. You werent supposed to hurt anyone else. I tried to stop ityouyoure just a monster.     Its back. The pain, the grueling headache I had just moments ago. I can only squeeze my eyes shut so hard, this is unbearable. I finally gain the strength to open my eyes and standing in front of me in a dimly lit, borderline-condemnable house, was Jack. The same, rapidly aged Jack I was just speaking to. Except I wasnt a child anymore, and we werent outside throwing a football. With very little light in this room, I could make out some electronics laying around, with a few wires attached to both myself and Jack, but I cant make out what is all over me. Jack sadly lowers his head as he begins taking off the wires. Whatthefuck Jack. WHAT IS GOING ON?! I inquire, with my voice getting louder with rage every time a new word is muttered. I feel it, the rageits taking over. Is this what Jack was talking about? What did I do? Who did I   FREEZE! DOWN ON THE GROUND NOW JACK! WE WILL SHOOT IF YOU MAKE ANY SUDDEN MOVEMENTS! WHAT THE FUCK? Who are these people and how do they know Jack? Better yet, why are they pointing their guns at me? Jack is right in front of me. Im not a monster of any sorts. It was then I realizedIm a liar. I instantly black out, and now Im covered in blood, and the light from the sun is peaking through an old doorway. I see bodies everywhere, but no Jack. I see my childhood friends, SWAT officers, a preacherand so many more. Who did this? As I question myself, I notice a dusty, half covered mirror catch a small ray of sunshine from his corner. I uncover it, and I know who I see in the mirror, but its not Tim. Tim is dead, they are all dead. I.amJack, and I will never be stopped. I am in every single one of you, dont suppress your Jack, or I will be the next thing you see in the mirror.      See you soon.   Smoke a lot of weed.   Eminem   I want the truth!!!   Did you do it?   Did you order the code red?   Don't care if I'm working, I'm always down to help!   It IS the truth though.   I was dead, but thanks to amazing surgeons and modern science, I was revived after being born dead and I'm perfectly healthy today. Well, I'm a Redditor, so I'm not perfect.   Your Grandmom looks like Lindsay Lohan, after the drugs.   Out of all games, RE4? I would beat that shit at least 12 times in a week before my gaming career would end.   Could be a board game, video game, card game, etc.  	43
                Something that makes me go "WTF", and by WTF I mean WHAT THE FUCK, not Wow, That's Fascinating... I don't come here to be fascinated, I want to be shocked in some way whether it's gore or somebody who accidentally took a shit in their pants at a Dunkin Donuts. I primarily enjoy the latter.              Sorry, I meant it in the sense that there are epic stunts where the camera doesn't cut.    Ew FUCK RUSSIA right now.    Which cow? I think I missed it. The standing birth almost made me sick but she caught her baby and then it was kinda beautiful.                                                       When we get some mods that know CSS or whatever we'll add a FAKE tag.             It has been a very long time since I was actually grossed out by something on this sub. Thank you.                Damnnnnnnn. Also, upvote for Austin Powers reference.       The ladder one wasn't anybody's fault but the blonde bitch.    I'm not abuckley...    I invited MrGhost1 to be a mod but he hasn't been able to accept yet. Are you good at CSS? Message me.    Call this number now. I implore you.       Damn. That was crazy! It would have hit the reporter in the head!                        Basically what the title says. It's gonna be a subreddit to post things that are just totally epic. Think a guy fighting a bear with his bare hands and winning or something... Evil Knievel shit... etc... Hope we can get some great content. Please message me /r/EAF   Epic as fuck. Not really WTF but have an upvote anyway.    Oh my god. Kill it with fire.    His voice sounds so young he might be... He has to be a great actor to play that bad of an actor.    I didn't cringe. That is all.    Absolutely no cringe. Pure genius.   How did you do the dough, and how did you bake it? Do you have a pizza oven? Looks great.    very strong cringe   Meh.       Very WTF.    I hope you beat it but at the same time hope you don't.   Pure Art.    It's like if Stevie from Eastbound and Down became a stoner to impress Kenny.    It wasn't that bad... The audio was kinda shitty, but you are definitely talented at drawing.    That was hilarious.    8 Oz. of Organic Chicken breast   1/2 Cup of OrganicVille Marinara Sauce   2 Slices of Organic Mozzarella Cheese   4 Cloves of Organic Garlic    Cook the chicken breast with sliced up garlic using pam or some zero calorie spray on a pan, add salt and pepper to your liking. I use a lot of pepper. Add tomato sauce at last minute. Take Chicken off pan and put it on a plate. Mix garlic with sauce and pour ontop of chicken, place slices of cheese on top. Add salt and pepper. Put plate into oven on Broil and remove when it is to your liking.  Also, not pictured I added two table spoons of Parmasan afterwards.    She looks like a Michael Jackson pumpkin carving.       Why the fuck is it still bitching? You got a good face, asshole.   Who loves Shrek this much??   This hurts. He's the best.   I'm sane. I say that not expecting you to believe that. No offense, but you're hurting me with that look. See, I'll tell you the truth but let me say everything that's on my mind before you pass any judgement. I mean, I know you'll pass judgement but reserve your final judgement until I tell you everything.   I hear voices. In my head. Like real voices and they're really mean. AND THEY'RE NOT ME. I know my voice, my voice is the one talking to you. My voice is from my heart. These voices are like ghosts or demons that live in my head.   I'm so scared. Sorry, I love you. Please, don't say anything. Just. Like. I'm afraid you're not gonna believe me. This is so painful for me.   See, like, I hear the voices. But I ignore them. I know they're not me but they won't go away. I used to fight them and tell them to get out or to go die or to fuck themselves but then they would attack me. They know my every insecurity and they say stuff at times you wouldn't be able to understand how painful it gets.   I just heard one laugh. Now they're whispering. I swear this is real. I hear them. I don't think they're me, if they told me to kill somebody I would never do it! I swear! Joann, please believe me. They're laughing even harder now. I just want this to stop. I just want to go back to normal. I hate it here. The voices aren't going away. Their treatment isn't working!    I'm sorry. I'll stop crying.   Thank you. Thank you.   The doctors say i'm insane, but it's the voices that are insane.      I don't care about fat, it's about calories. I read a 3 second spray is about 15 calories which is still a fraction of the amount of calories compared to olive oil. I looked it up after posting this so I guess the dish is closer to 470 calories.   http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fats-and-oils/9751/2  still way less than olive oil.    It says it's blocked in my country. I've been using spectrum cold pressed organic olive oil spray from whole foods. I prefer the taste of olive oil but it's very high in calories so I've switched to the spray and I've been losing weight.    I think maybe if they both get really close to death and he saves them she might say it. I really doubt it though. She's really broken.    This sounds exactly like it. I wish I could find it.    I want to see Skyler say I love you to Walt. I don't know why. Maybe she doesn't... It's just so sad.    There was a movie / show I saw on the Sci-Fi channel in the mid nineties when I was about 9 where a guy took a girl to his bed to sleep with her and then the bed ate her and the guy was like "Seriously, bed, you ate another girl I like?" and I think the bed said, "Phil, she wasn't right for you." or something. It scared the living shit out of me. I would love to see it again if anybody know what it is.    I mean if Joel Shumacher could shoot this show well I'm sure Jodie will be able to.    8 Oz. of Organic Chicken breast - 250 Calories.  1/2 Cup of OrganicVille Marinara Sauce - 40 Calories.   2 Slices of Organic Mozzarella Cheese - 140 Calories  4 Cloves of Garlic - 15 Calories  Cook the chicken breast with sliced up garlic using pam or some zero calorie spray on a pan, add salt and pepper to your liking. I use a lot of pepper. Add tomato sauce at last minute. Take Chicken off pan and put it on a plate. Mix garlic with sauce and pour ontop of chicken, place slices of cheese on top. Add salt and pepper. Put plate into oven on Broil and removes when it is to your liking.      That sounds delicious.    Reminds me of the chokey.    It might have been Voldemort.    I love this movie.    I mean... It could be for intimidation... But yeah... We all felt it... Walt is willing to take Jesse out... Perhaps.. I'd like to believe he really couldn't... .Oh god... *tears begin swelling*   Link to the original wallpaper?   I eat it for dinner several nights a week.    Fuckin' Heisenberg.    I would cry my eyes out. I almost did tonight because I really thought any second Walt was about to kill Jesse. God, if he does this I will never forgive him and I will completely hope he dies.    I would love this... All the things I'm scared of happening such as Walt killing Jesse or Walt's family getting hurt wouldn't happen and all this awesomeness would happen. The show is truly unpredictable but I would be satisfied with your story.    That... that was beautiful. What a true inspiration.    That's scary to me. The whole thing is sad.    How is this funny?   Yeah.. When he said nobody else in Hollywood is more up for the role than BA I LOL'd. They better have a good script. S'all I'm sayin.    It's a great tasty meal for dieting. Thus it's in Fit Meals and not FoodPorn.       Yeah.. it was fun... But it was nowhere near what Rare would have done. The music alone was terrible in comparison. Still, it was fun and I'm going to get that tropical freeze one or whatever it's called. But damn... Imagine a world with the same old rare.    I mean... I didn't cringe... He shouldn't have said he didn't want to talk about Bradley Manning, should have made a small point and continues but what's going on in Russia is pretty despicable and should be a topic of discussion especially considering the fucking olympics are happening there and there are many gay athletes.    THATS WHAT I THINK. I'm ready to say, OH DIE MARK, how dare you call one of the greatest artists of our time, A DISASTER ARTIST. If THE ROOM is a disaster, you sir are more retarded than Denny, because The Room is a masterpiece, you philistine prick.    i really don't want walt to kill anybody hes related to, or jesse, or saul... everybody else is free game... but i love everyone too much.    Unless part of her still loves Walt, and she's been afraid of it this whole time. I hope so. But possibly not. It would be nice, though.    I felt bad for her but now it seems she's growing some balls, which I hope makes her worth loving. I really felt she might say, in the most recent episode "I love you, Walt.", and I would have just died.    Yeah, that sucked ass.    I'm not sure if it was in Breaking Bad, but I'm pretty sure Walt is talking to Jesse about how lies put up invisible barriers between people, and with Jane, Walt could never be truly honest with Jesse ever again... I think that was the beginning of Walt and Jesse's emotional alienation. I believe.    That.... was amazing.    Amazing. Made me want to start smoking weed and stay up all night again. Those were the days.    She could just go all Monica Lewinsky on him... Probably would ruin her career though.    WTF, that was pretty stupid.    I agree with you mostly. She wants a higher quality product with Todd, yet standards won't be high enough, so somehow she's going to try to get Walt back in, and she won't be able to so she might need to persuade him some how, which could involve hurting those he loves. I would be really sad if Walt's family is hurt. Really sad. I really like Skyler now. I want the Whites to live.    That's totally what's going to happen.    Also, Voldemort is like really evil.. Like really really evil. He's like the most evil wizard in the world and like, he wanted Snape to suffer. You know, just for the lols.    There were lots of parallels to the pilot in this episode. Seeing Walt in his underwear, and him passing out in the bathroom. I totally felt like they were trying to evoke the pilot.    blue balls is all i can say. major fuckin blue balls.    my dog started barking like crazy when i started playing this. he never barks. and he's outside. i'm so scared right now.    I'm actually agnostic.    Holy Shit, you deserve gold. PLEASE DO MORE. 11/10.    That was awesome! And so is God Dangit, Bobby!    The Room really is one of the greatest films of all time.    It's a really terrible piece of fiction.    That was sad.    God, that scene is so funny. Charlie Kaufman is a genius.    Emma said the Bible? WTHHH  	127
 Back door BBQ sluts 5   I can clearly see this is where the dicks hang out   I'd bang her so hard that time would reverse all the way back to before OP was born. then I could bang her and poke OP in the head with my thunderous shlong thrust.   	3
 You would think something like this would get more attention, same way as the TPP.    Before I posted this I had also posted the article of the Intercept on /r/news and only got 2 up votes. I'm fairly new to Reddit and I've noticed that TPP articles don't come up on the front page.          8 inches?! And flaccid?!? Holy fuck!  	5
       Seemed to me like the author did a decent job of summing up the research and then applying a critical, skeptical mindset to the results, which any decent science journalist should do.  Any scientific research is limited in scope in some fashion, but the point of comparing a one-off study like this to prior research is to give perspective. Sure, maybe the prior research had some limitations, but a whole lot of it also seemed to have reached the opposite conclusion as the current study, which is very important to know!                                                               The results of this study really aren't surprising. If teens start using nicotine before adulthood, they're more likely to crave nicotine throughout their lives. Prior research has demonstrated that brain development is altered with nicotine use.   A major limitation of the study to keep in mind: "The studys cross-sectional nature didnt allow the researchers to identify whether most youths initiated with conventional cigarettes or e-cigarettes."  That's a pretty big drawback.      Fooled a lot of people:  "That is so dope but did you filter that or something? Looks almost too good haha"  "Sweet car man, New York?"       Fantastic!            Taco Bell... breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  But in all honesty, [this](http://www.gastro.org/patient-center/digestive-conditions/gas-in-the-digestive-tract#Foods%20 %20Gas) guide from the American Gastroenterological Association lists foods like cauliflower, brussels sprouts, dried beans, broccoli, cabbage, bran, dairy, and fructose. Sounds like a lot of vegetarian diets are probably high-flatulogenic.    You're right to be skeptical. The picture the article paints is somewhat bleak. But there's a tinge of hopefulness at the end.                     Studies like these prompt a lot of boneheaded, insensitive comments, which attract the ~~sharks~~ amazing and awesome mods. :D        	42
 A lot of people are dicks, but know that not everyone is.  If you ever wanna talk, you can pm me :)   Even cis white males?   I would say chocolate but I hate it cuz it's so tempting and it makes me fat.   My name is Pablo Diego Jose Fransisco...  	4
 Can anyone tell me if this is a fake? Can i get banned for using something like this? http://csgo.gamebanana.com/tools/5684   You don't learn if you get destroyed every round. If both teams have one "smurf" as a coach, then I guess it would be fair cause they could give advice from both sides.   If your friend sucks - let it be. He may be Silver, but he will learn in time and rank up to the rank he deserves.   I mean, that's my personal opinion. I'm not again'st teaching. Boosting is not the same thing as teaching.    I was thinking maybe adding doors to squeeky-room from outside would make it better? You could basically fake-outside and sit like ducks, and then push to A.  I don't know, just an idea.   "I'm smurfing to avoid cheaters and play with my low ranked friends."  Reality is, 90% of smurfs I meet usually start shit-talking after a few rounds of destroying. It always ends up that the low ranked friends stand clueless while their smurf friends "unintentionally" boost them, making the ranking system useless. When I go with my main, and my friend is Silver we get enemies in-between Nova 2-4, which is perfect for both my friend and me. But buying another account just to destroy low ranked people is just a stupid pretext.  "If you play again'st smurfs you get a chance to improve!"  Smurfs are bad for new players, just like cheaters are bad to smurfs. Please think about it. Also, as stupid as it is, cheaters are everywhere. You simply CANNOT avoid cheaters unless Volvo adds shadow-banning or something along those lines.      What are you trying to scam here!? Too low!  P.S: Kappa   FUNC_VEHICLE IS A RIGHT NOT A PRIVILEGE   we need server pl0xerino   And i just got banned cause of time-out. Probably related.   The glitch when the match ends but it shows as if you disconnected from it, if you press reconnect you go to an empty scoreboard with bots and you can't leave cause you will get a ban.   cyka blyat   Someone has to edit this with mortal kombat music   Imho I doubt about Hotel Gellert. It looks too good to be consistent with other maps, also considering the amount of custom content it uses (Everything, actually).  No hate, just saying it's kind of an artwork rather than a competitive beast map.     Masks are nowhere associated with that.  It's a problem with the Source engine in general. Ever saw someones gun barrel sticking through the door in CS:GO? Yes, It's that. I doubt it can be fixed without any major engine changes.   Go to prop properties and choose collision box as none. Then, you must add clipping brushes in a shape of the helicopter. Clip brushes are basically invisible solid walls that do not act as nodraw.   Forgot to mention these ;) ak-47 fire serpent awp corticera glock water elemental   It's because they are not creative at all. You know, having a sip is good, but having too much is just absolutely disgusting. Asiimov is unique in it's own way, because it's one of the first "flashy" skins released. I don't have any problem with fire serpent, corticera or any of that kind either - They are simplistic but they have a unique art of their own. It just looks like cyrex..  I don't see what's unique about all of those. I can't see what sets them apart besides different color and the way stripes are placed. Look, even guardian has a CT logo on it.   I still have 4 days to go, posted about it a while back. Did not receive many attention though. Hope Volvo unbans and fixes pl0x   more tron skins pls   Great. Aliens develop a cure for us.   Hey! It's simple. The timezone table above shows when it's gonna be up, you connect to the IP and play the game, that's all! Preferably, you can choose to join Teamspeak as well. And no, there's no skill minimum, people join to have fun.  GL!   Just so that someone in the world on the internet could ask "cool... but why?"   "Oh, so this is what 128 tick feels like!"   Well, that escalated quickly. What was the chat after? Did they say anything? :P   It's a glitch in Source engine when you Alt-Tab.    Stop SoloQ'ing. That helped me.   A lot of people will reply usual stuff like "learn nades, practice aim ETC", and it's true on some part, but you're stuck on a thing called ELO hell. I was stuck on it a while ago, i had to win 15 matches in a row to rank straight back up.   Have you referred to the related thread? Definitely not.   Exactly what happened. Yours is not as bad as mine, unfortunately, as I got 7 day ban. :/    Agreed, 7 day ban was imminent as I left few matches back due to a cheater.   I did not really know I had to wait so much, so It feels bad rather. It's really silly. It should not have happened in the first place.   When the match ended, I noticed something was wrong. My rank did not appear, even though I was supposed to rank up. I got automatically dropped to main menu as usual. However, I noticed a button reconnect (Even though i didn't disconnect manually as the match ended) and i pressed it. There were only bots and a scoreboard, as I exited i got a 7 day ban. It never happened before.  It's absolutely outrageously unfair, I just won a match and then i got a 7 day ban? TL:DR; The match ended and it shown as if I abandoned the match, got a 7 day cooldown.  EDIT: Yes, I filled steam support ticket, but they usually reply something silly like: "Have you tried verifying your game cache?" "We're sorry but cooldown bans are not lifted." It all happened due to a glitch, and I won't be able to play just because of something so silly. Next week I will be busy, and I really wan't to enjoy CS:GO by that time. This is a question if anyone has the same problem and a bug report. Reddit can give a lot of attention to the developers, so hopefully I'll find my way out. Thanks.  DOUBLE EDIT:  "Steam Support cannot modify or reverse a matchmaking cooldown or ban, regardless of the circumstances under which it was issued."  So I'm screwed. Thanks, Valve.   TRIPLE EDIT (WOMBO COMBO): It appears like I'm not the only one on Steam discussions, let's have our fingers crossed Valve will remove the bans issued. (A lot of lately discussions on the same subject, same problem)   The map is great, most definitely. (The layout, after all, it did win the CEVO contest) The only problem I find personally, is the theme. No hate, great map, just a little bit lack of creativity on design side.   Or just a leftover from Source engine?   Outside lighting could be changed, I'd suggest go with night time setting.  Add lamps on the building, it makes no sense having lights appear out of nowhere :P (Use model light_inset or somethin' like that, scale down brightness and add an env_sprite) Also, add more prop models.. Trash bins ETC. The map looks blocky ATM, add more detail and depth to your brushes (geometry), such as engravings and stuff. There's a lot more to say, but there's still room for general improvement so good luck. Also, add more colors to the lighting and change the ambient color in light_environment.   They should bring back the mode in general.   has juan deag gone too far?   It has to be at least longer than five dududududu's   You shall never rush gods gift... How dare you.   Kickception   There was a riot shield in 1.6 too, babies ;)   Make it cost more than Negev, then we're talking.   RIP OP   There are a few possible answers. First one, is that it might be the update problem. Second, your FPS might be capped. Use fps_max 0 to uncap. (Capping makes it worse for me) Last answer, and hopefully the correct one is your ventilator. The cooling system. When I used to play on my laptop and turned off noise from ventilator it started having periodical chockes on framerate. Really, clean it, change it, try it. One more - Try right clicking CSGO and launching using Nvidia GPU.    They are very close minded, but if you speak a little Russian and answer to what they ask you, trust me, they are good at stuff they do. Not most of the time, unfortunately.    I don't see a problem making a map with a familiar layout as long as it's not 1-1 copy.    Will do.    Why? I wanna see it!   Thanks Valve, just met at least one cheater 5 matches in a row.   Add tagging instead of aimpunch?   Func_vehicle is a right, not a privilege!   Spent milking Dota2 Kappa   Find out in the next episode of Dragon Ball GO!   Can't tell if OP trolling or just...   I'm salivating just by looking at the screenshot   Where's Gaben? I didn't find Waldo, though. :(   If you hate the smoke, you might as well as turn down the graphics settings? Cause that's what causes it.  (Particles don't have shadow support in Source engine. Or so i think.)   Decoy bomb would be a better idea. - "Guys! Bomb is dropped on B! Come quick!" - Bomb has been planted - "Cyka blyat"   It does, unfortunately for bump maps to look good you have to have a cubemap in each corresponding area, thus having a HUGE performance drop. This technique should be only used sparingly, such as for tiles. (Ever thought why tunnels is the only place having reflectivity in Dust2?)  There's some hope, though, if you add $detail to a wall texture coming close up to it it will look a lot more detailed, so for let's say wood we'd do $detail wood. Anyways, if you use Pakrat and look up the textures you can modify them, so I'm gonna do that and possibly make a "texture" mod for Tuscan.  Lastly, If you open console and write "fogui" you'll get a menu to edit fog, try without it. Looks a lot better. Damn it Brute, If you are a mapper you should also consider learning to make textures!   It does, it's just dead. L2su (Learn 2 set up)   gr8 map m8 i r8 8/8 i hop u dunt h8   It's remade already. I hope people will start using workshop one day. :P   My dear friend... I hope you realize that the map looked waaay better before? The only reason it wasn't really "widely" accepted is because you put a lot of unnecessary stuff on spawns. Other than that, it's an amazing map. I applaud you for your effort! I'm just trying to express that i liked it way before this update, no offence.   Nostalgia, rather.   Backalley has been already remade, check out workshop.   Hook me up with modeller/texture artist for neon signs and I'll do it.    I don't think anyone should be aiming for the operation. Everyone should be aiming for feedback, Leagues and players enjoying the map. Remember on CS 1.6 golden era where the best maps were Surf, FY ETC? Everyone made the maps to ENJOY them.   Gamebreaking*   The only problem with Torn is it's size. It's ENORMOUS.   It's because i had low anti-aliasing on screenshots. All of the little bumps you see are detail brushes, I'll re-upload screenshots later.   It's fine, just let me know what makes it look like a CSS map and what i could improve on. I'm open for opinions and improvements!  	70
 This is a very good interview (8 min) with **Michael Hudson** (a Distinguished Research Professor of Economics at the University of Missouri, Kansas City, and author of *The Bubble and Beyond and Finance Capitalism and its Discontents* and *Killing the Host: How Financial Parasites and Debt Bondage Destroy the Global Economy*) and **William K. Black** (author of *The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One*, professor of economics and law at the University of Missouri Kansas City).  Edit: Part 2 of the interview is also *very* good.   NATO, Europe and the US have mutual interest in not allowing Russia's continued expansionist position. Putin needs to be stopped.    too many laws have to be changed to make bankruptcy possible  And, it would change the terms of debt that was issued, with investors understanding that bankruptcy was *not* a possibility.    [And 2014's Worst Currency Was...Bitcoin](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-12-23/and-2014s-worst-currency-wasbitcoin)  Its plunge of more than 56 percent in 2014 makes it the world's worst performing currency this year, according to Bloomberg, which tracks 175 foreign-exchange values.  And it's down another 17% year-to-date.   Yes   no. Extremely well produced and acted. The writing is very good. The plot drrrrrraaaaaags along through several episodes. However, the slow plot progression allows for in-depth personal development of many characters, interpersonal relationships, analysis of "career choices" (for cops, politicians and drug dealers), and political commentary.   Yes, its good - but only if you have patience as the plots play out.    "If I said you have a gorgeous body, would you hold it against me?"   **Hubris** - sometimes it has severe consequences.

Her husband left her for one of her relatives  She got custody of the  youngest kids, then moved states to marry my dad.  She raised us all just like we were all hers.

[The **Brazen Bull**,](http://www.worldmysteries.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/the-Brazen-Bull.jpg) bronze bull, or Sicilian bull, was a torture and execution device designed in ancient Greece. Perillos of Athens invented and proposed it to Phalaris, the tyrant of Akragas, Sicily, as a new means of executing criminals. The bull was made entirely of bronze, hollow, with a door in one side. The bull was in the form and size of an actual bull and had an acoustic apparatus that converted screams into the sound of a bull. The condemned were locked in the device, and a fire was set under it, heating the metal until the person inside roasted to death.   I wanted to go to a concert so I traded shifts and bought the tickets. After that the manager said "new policy - no trading shifts." I explained that I already arranged it before the new policy. He said I had to choose between the job and the concert.  It was a great concert.   This is the start of **the PRexit crisis**. Panic will ensue.   Where was this taken?

Immaculate deception    I agree. By "America" I meant the majority of Americans.   What a majority of Americans want is much less influential on enacted policy than what donors and lobbyists demand.     There is a large difference between what the general American population wants, and what our "representatives" do. Research shows that popular opposition to (or support for) a policy has a small effect in a majority  of cases. However, support/opposition from a much smaller constituency of "influential" entities has significant effect. This small minority of wealthy contributors, (individual, corporate, PACs, etc.) and lobbyists has a much greater impact on US policy.   TLDR: What a majority of Americans want is much less influential on enacted policy than what donors and lobbyists demand.    I agree - Iran will stay the course and just keep delaying.  PS - The earliest predecessor of the game of chess probably originated in India, before the 6th century AD; a minority of historians believe the game originated in China.

Without humans, does math exist? I'm just asking (and apparently pissing off Redditors by asking).   I have to admit, I was a bit flippant in my phrasing. That said, I didn't expect this level of piling on without interest in intellectual pursuit. Especially in a post about mathematical proofs. Very ironic.    I have found the downvotes without cogent supporting arguments to be disappointing. Of course I have only myself to blame.

["He's taking a nap"](http://clips.armstrongandgettybingo.com/clips/nap)  Thanks Obama!    Happy Kitty, Sleepy Kitty, purr, purr, purr.   As a metaphysical solipsist, I disagree. In fact, my self is the only existing reality and all other reality, including the external world and other persons, and Reddit are representations of my self, and have no independent existence. I am all that exists.    In addition, new drivers should follow the 4 second rule. When the car in front of you drives over a paint line, count slowly to 4. If you pass it before 4, you are following too close.  Yes, this means others will pass you and merge into that space - which can be annoying.

The universe, the world and other minds may not exist, and I have no way of proving that they do.  You kind Redditor are likely a construct of my mind which is simply creating an illusionary universe as a form of amusement.    It's like looking at the ocean and seeing a division between the sand and the ocean. But the "division" doesn't really exist. The beach exists, and the ocean exists, but the "division" is an illusion.  Similarly, there is no "present". It is an illusion of our senses interpreting what has happened in the past few minutes, seconds, milliseconds, etc. . . . in anticipation of what is to come in the future.   No thanks.

Edit 1 - After several downvotes I have seen no response with an argument as to why we should see math as a given feature of the universe rather than simply a human creation. The downvotes without responses make me more convinced that I am correct. If I could come up with a counter argument, I would.

 I'm sorry to see them swap out the main female lead  This might change your mind.  The plot is based around a incident in Sioux Falls in the 1970s. This incident involved Molly's father (Lou) and is canonical to the series, infact it was referenced in season 1 several times. So while it will have a new set of leads, there are plenty of references to keep the series whole :)  I'm really fucking excited for this one.       Cum inside (   )   I'm so glad that you used 'than' instead of 'then'. It would've been a hilarious title if you had though :)   Australian reporting in. People can live off being a server down here. Tipping seems entirely stupid as a concept. That being said, I do unload any unwanted shrapnel in the tip jar at coffee shops.   I think the problem is that wedding tackle in yoga pants will likely scare children.   My most prolific relationship started as a random hook up and ended up after a long battle becoming a fantastic LTR. I wrote  a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/38fd7t/ok_askmen_now_that_weve_heard_your_stupid_stories/cruy75f?context=3) about it a while back.  Now that I think about it, nearly all of the girls I've dated have been from just random encounters.   This is the thing though, friend zone has become bastardised. I always thought it meant that extremely rare woman who knowingly strings a guy along to get free shit from him. Nowadays, anytime some dude gets rejected he gets 'friend zoned'. It is embarrassing. I hate the word entitlement, but it kinda applies there.   - Black science man.   Having hair.   I see posts from women who talk about loving guys hair. I started going bald at 22 and at 27 I now fully shave my head. So while I'm ok with it, when you hear that having hair is a deal breaker, I do get some insecurity with it.   I find zero need to rely on it. My parents brought my siblings and I up with no mention of religion. I have a awesome family, good morals and a positive future. All without religion.   Its gotta be, right?   Yeah, rub that lamp (   )   How has no one referenced the [Beck v Eiland-Hall case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck_v._Eiland-Hall) of 2009. This is honestly one of the funniest things you'll read.  A satirist used Glenn Becks obnoxious style of 'journalism' to insinuate that Glenn Beck raped and murdered a girl in 1990.  It's insanely funny and he ended up winning the suit. It also ended up becoming a rather amusing example of the Streisand Effect.     knock on wood  (   )    It's true, I'm obviously not doing what I'm doing for the reaction of others. But that look is pretty damn awesome.  When my friend called me ravishing, it was rather funny. I was talking to her and I took off my hoodie. I then noticed her looking me up and down, it was like really obvious and she just kinda stopped me in the middle of my sentence "Holy shit, have you lost weight, like - a lot of weight?"     Route and Router.  Australia is inconsistent at times.   We pronounce 'Route' as 'Root' but we don't call a 'Router' a 'Rooter'.  Americans have us beat on that I guess.  For further hilarity, *root* is slang for sex in Australia.  So Route 69 is funnier than ever.   Can confirm.  **Wooster sheer sauce: am Australian.**   Thanks! You should've seen her face when I got off the scale. It was awesome.   She didn't know what a blowjob was.  So I first heard the word 'blowjob' in the school yard and in my innocence I asked my brother what it meant. He being the older sibling told me to ask our mum (prick was fucking with me). I asked mum, with literally no idea what it was and she said "Oh I have no idea". I went through life happy with the notion that my mum has never heard of oral sex before.  Years late this story took a more R rated revision, much laughter was had and all of it was at my expense.  **Edit: I want to follow that up with a nicer story**, growing up I had a very active imagination and I used to get really horrible and vivid nightmares. It was rather crippling. I had one reoccuring one where I would dream about a monster in my closet. I had this dream several times a week and my mother rushed into my room asking what was wrong, I tearfully told her about my dreams so she said she was going to get the *monster spray*. "What's *monster spray?*" I asked "You've never heard of this? It's a old family secret for getting rid of those nasty monsters".   So she took this unlabeled water spray bottle and sprayed the closet. I had never slept better after that. I got placebo'd and I love her for it.   Unless you're like me and you just started doing strength training. My body hates me haha   I'm sorry to hear about that /u/Sarahthelizard.  Are you at least being accepted into the lizard community?   I was asked something last night which made me think. Someone asked "Woah, why are you in such a good mood?". It's a simple enough question, but upon thinking about it...   This has been a good fucking week.     First, I finally had my **whoosh** and dropped a chunk of weight. This drop brought me down to a BMI of 35 (that's 6 bmi points since I started 3 months ago), that's 38 lbs dropped and 4 inches off my waist.  Also, a friend who noticed my weight loss referred to me as 'ravishing'. That one hit home :)  This surge of awesomeness gave me some serious motivation and I've been hitting the gym with more fervor then ever. I had initially been doing a 4 mph fast walk for 45~ minutes with small 5 mph jogging increments, this week I was able to have a total of 15 minutes of jogging into my 45~ minute work out. This is without any soreness or discomfort [(Here is the FitBit graph for that workout, I love me some data)](http://i.imgur.com/d4UGzZn.png). I can actually take on stairs without any shortness of breath. Adding to this, after Mondays workout while stretching my calves I noticed a dude staring at my calves. He then said "nice calves man", as a straight guy, I'm not used to getting random dude compliments - it was pretty awesome.   And finally, nearly 3 months ago I had a physical with my doctor, where I announced that I was going to lose weight. She was supportive and gave me lots of information to help me, but she had this weird tone in her voice, like she had heard this 1000 times before and she was almost reading off a script. She kept on mentioning for me to manage expectations and ensure discipline and all that stuff. I knew even then that this time was different than the other times. I knew I could do this. I still can't explain why.  So yesterday was our 3 month follow up to discuss my progression and do any further blood work (had worries about my iron levels, turns out I'm ok! :D). She was beyond excited to see my progress, she admitted that she constantly see people who can't follow through and it's rare to see such spontaneous progress without some sort of mortal danger precursor. According to her, she wants to *bottle me up for her other patients*.  One of the things she asked was where I get my motivation and accountability from. I told her that I'm accountable to myself but as far as support and motivation goes, I proudly nominated reddit. I explained to her /r/loseit, /r/progresspics and /r/fitness. She had never heard of them but upon hearing about it exclaimed that she will for sure pass on these links to her other patients.  Thank you guys for being awesome.   Regards,  train_subject5967, that dude with the ravishing calves.   **Edit for context: 27/m/ 5'10 SW: 285 CW: 247 GW: NOTAFATSHIT**   Hey Channing,  You were honestly the **best** thing about Foxcatcher. I say that fully understanding and accepting Steve Carrel's amazing performance. I think you were robbed as far as awards are concerned. You've shown that you can really nail a dramatic performance.  Are we going to see more of Channing in these powerful dramatic roles in the future?   Really good article, as a lover of the book this has given me more confidence in the adaptation.  ..I see him [Watney] as this very funny but very, very smart guy, which is something I talked to the writer about, Drew[Goddard]. **He described it as a love letter to science**..  This sentence made me happy.   Sucks to hear, because that dude can act. He was one of my favourite parts of Reservoir Dogs.   **Sugar-Free** Space Jam  FTFY   Jesus fucking christ, that was a rollercoaster to read.  I'm glad to see you're on the bandwagon, well done :)  read your labels  This I can totally agree with. It's so important to get a proper gauge for what you're eating.    For me it was a mix of ignorance and deception for sure. I was the same as you and equated weight loss with exercise. Sadly that general ignorance is still very much rampant in society.  With all the information all over reddit, I'm down 37 pounds in almost 4 months. I fucking hate how I could let ignorance fuel me so much.   This isn't about me, it's about my sister. She married a guy about 4 years ago and had a kid 2 years ago with him.  The thing about his side of the family, is that the mother is a controlling bitch and has my sisters husband under her thumb. Initially when they agreed to get married, they were both living with his mother (lets call her **Attila the Mum**). That was a little dysfunctional since he was well into his 20s. But what ever.  Since they've had the kid though, my sister has been trying to move out and start their own life away from his family. You know, like normal people. But Attila won't allow that.  She has him under her control so much, that he's actually convinced he's not capable of living away from home. This ended up causing a rift where my sister couldn't take it anymore so she gave him the reasonable ultimatum *"We're married, we either move out together or we break up."*  He chose his fucking mother. Unbelievable. Since this split, my sister has been living with my parents temporarily (my parents promoted a healthy attitude towards moving out asap). This whole thing has been beyond awful and now we're getting all of this bullshit where *doctors* that Attila knows have stated that my sister is an unfit mother and that she should be with Attila.  Now that really makes my fucking blood boil, my sister is the most kinda hearted mother I know, she has wanted to work in child care as far as I can remember.   Long fucking story fucking short. I wish my sister had thought more about marrying and having a child with someone who is still by all accounts - a child. I honestly can't even fathom parents who actively keep their kids from moving out. It's your responsibility to prepare them for the real world you fucking narcissists.  **TL:DR my sister is regretting not giving further scrutiny to her new family before getting married.**   Really good points, thanks for that.  But lets say that TWOW comes out before season 6 (here's hoping :D), that means that we won't be spoiled for any TWOW content.  We're still going to have the show spoil the last part of the story as the show will be long finished before ADOS. So while it's good that in delaying TWOW info this season, we have been given a reprieve from spoilers for TWOW. It is just that, a reprieve. We're still going to see the show's adaptation of the series finale :(   Blizzard CS for my wow friends.  VicRoads for any of my Australian friends living in Victoria. All traffic accidents are reported near instantly :)   I don't necessarily do cheat **days** as much as I do cheat **meals**. This also varies in frequency, could be once a week, could be once a fortnight.  The main thing I reserve cheat days for, is alcohol.  I've been off the booze for almost 4 months and I've only had drinks twice since then. Once for a bucks and once for a friends 30th birthday. I'll only indulge for special occasions.  The next time I'll be drinking is the upcoming weekend. I'm traveling interstate to visit a friend who've I've not seen in months. This is going to be a cheat weekend it seems, at least as far as alcohol is concerned :)   Hey guys   So I've been more avid of late to hit the gym, this has consisted of 2-4x 45 minute long cardio sessions per week.  Initially it was just fast walking, but I started adding bouts of jogging here and there and before I knew it, I was doing 2x 5 minute jogs in my 45 minute session.   The other week I started getting some pain in my ankles and foot arches. I realised the main culprit.  My running shoes.  They were old and most certainly not longer doing their job for me amping up my efforts. I went out and spent $200 on a new pair which were fitted for my and **holy shit** has that made a difference.  The first session back with my new shoes I ran 2x 10 minute jogging without any discomfort at all. I'm now far more comfortable increasing my efforts as time goes on.   Do yourself a favour and invest the money, it will make a difference :)   Thanks for this, as a metric system dude this has always confused me.   I lost my virginity on Australia Day, thus I'm a true patriot.   Jurassic World premiered this weekend with no other movie doing the same, without that fresh competition it makes sense that it's breaking records.   because when The Winds of Winter comes out in 2017  :(   The fact that you don't want to be in a relationship right now is only going to be harder to deal with the longer you stay.   Nice work man, I was at 285 3 months ago - I'm at 248 now :D  I'm kicking myself I didn't start doing this earlier.   Please keep the subreddit simple and without over the top colour.    I'm so fucking pumped, the confidence in this film is excellent.   A 3rd of my pay check goes into savings every fortnightly pay. That is a sizeable amount plus it gives me (after paying for rent, bills etc) quite a bit of desposible income. What ever is left over the night before my next payday is transfered into savings. I've got quite a good nest egg   That's fucking disgusting. Who goes past the knuckle with someone platonic?   I don't see how it would be awkward at all, everyone at the gym already ignores each other and does their own thing. How would that be any different if things dont work out?  You would just go back to ignoring each other   Anything but satin boxers. Those sweaty fuckers were a representative of my teenage-hood.   Man, I hate non sequiturs almost as much as I hate tap dancing tea kettles.   The crime is the quality, not the targeted audience : /   I'm sad how few of my friends I can get to watch this series. I enjoy the fuck out of it.  That type of meta satire is just too funny.   I've tried everything guys, I almost got a few mates to join the bandwagon when I showed them the "I fucked a deaf chick" scene with Matt LeBlanc youtube.   I literally did it last night. Oh Netflix, you make this so easy,  Regards,  Australia.   Me! I'm happy :)  Honestly, I am. I'm at such a stable part of my life. 27, almost saved enough for a house, my career is solid and I have a permanent job doing what I love.   There were only two things which were actively bothering me. One was my weight and the other was finding myself a lady. These two issues tend to go hand in hand.  I've been working on my weight for the past 3 months, I'm down 16 kgs and I'm working on my fitness.  In a little bit, ill go back into the dating scene with some confidence and find me a lady :)  Please don't respond by saying "finding a girl won't make you happy, blah blah". I am happy, but I would be happier in a relationship. I left my last relationship a while ago because I wanted to be single to focus on my career. I'm done with that, I want to settle down.     The important thing is that you do stuff that the groom would want. If he really doesn't want strippers, don't do it.  We had a bachelor party last month and it was awesome because we catered it around the groom.  We started the morning with drinking while playing a massive game of croquet. After that, we headed to the city for a meal then we pub crawled until dinner them. Then we went back home and ate dinner, then the topless girls turned up and we played old school video games and drank well into the night.   Honestly, the best part of the day was in the middle where it was just all of us having a great time drinking in the pubs. We were all just celebrating our friend   Ok, this has been fucking annoying me for years. Peridically for the past *decade*, I've had the Winneh the Pooh bear theme song stuck in my head, but it only ever happens when I'm about to take a shower. I don't fucking get it, it happens once every month or so, I just open the shower door and suddenly..  **POOH BEAR, WINNEH THE POOH BEAR!!!**  I've not seen an episode since I was 8 years old.  Did I perhaps get molested by Winneh in the shower at 8?    whorecrux**   Huh? Why is it a waste? The money goes straight into supporting a website that you frequent, for free.  Your question is strange.   Lol, the funniest part of them is their customer support. "If you have any questions you can call us on XXX-XXX-XXX or contact us via live chat".  Of course I'm going to use live chat.    ayy   Its a motivator that the OP likely used often to deal with his weight loss.   Hypothetical - Lets say the OP has a dog, and walking that dog every day is his personal way to deal with his weight loss. If one day dogs were outlawed and he made a post on /r/loseit talking about how he thinks that the dog removal will affect his loss, would you have a problem with that post?  /r/loseit is totally a place where people can air their grievances and who knows, perhaps someone can point the OP towards something which can work as an alternative to his **dog**.  If he had made a post saying "I'm sad /r/fatpeoplehate was banned because I liked making fun of fatties", then I would be right on board with you. He's just a guy/girl who wants any help he/she can get with their struggles.   Fishing out my discarded cigarette butts, carefully pulling the left over tabacco out and rolling a cigarette with it.  : /   He's a chemist  Edit: Everyone has dual speciality. Watney is a botanist/mechanical engineer.    The gym. I just go there to use the treadmill anyway, why not run outside? Fuck I'm stupid.  Also my brazzers accout, the internet is full of free porn. WTH is wrong with me.   Because many people on /r/loseit frequent that subreddit to deal with their weight loss.    Apparently the shitlords from FPH were spamming there so they set it to private for now. Which sucks, I like that subreddit.   The problem time of night is normally around 9om. So what I do is just brush/floss/mouth wash early so that I'm not as tempted to chow down lol   Why is everyone circle jerking this anticipation.   MYRCELLA NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!    Could Ellara take the role of Darkstar? Probably.    Australian here, I'll go with *yes*. But I'll say it's no where near as much of a deal as it is in American culture.   Perhaps I'm just in a different crowd, but I think we have more pressure for fitness over bulk   I used to be irregular, but after 3 months of healthy living I'm down to 1-2 times a day. Maybe more, if I've had lots of coffee.   I have a favourite crappy beer, but it was from my universary days.   Back then I was living away from home i was only working a part time job. So I could only afford a slab of "Hammer and Tongs" beer. Its a shitty Australian beer which tastes like metal shards, but it's half the price of the standard local beer and just as potent.  Also no one would steal my beer at a party, like ever.   Lets start a business to get these men laid.  I guess you could say there is money inceling sex.   I'm not using it, but people at /r/loseit swear by it. I primarily use guestimation for my diet. I eat around 1800-2000 calories a day. My dinner is pretty much the same thing, with some variation on the side dishes and since I only eat twice a day - this makes having a consistent caloric input much easier.  My biggest piece of advice is to focus on what you eat, the second you realise that weight loss is 80% diet and 20% exercise, that's when you see how easy it actually is. Eat less to lose fat, exercise to get healthy.  It's also important that the word 'diet' is defined. 'Diet' shouldn't be a temporary thing. It's a change of lifestyle. What you're doing now, you need to do for the rest of your life. So when you make this 'diet' of yours, it's important to not exclude **anything**. Just have less of it.  You love the taste of french fries with your dinner? Then eat them with your dinner, just make sure you allow it into your daily caloric budget. What you'll realise after doing this is that the foods you love are likely caloric gold mines and you didn't even realise it. That has turned me off quite a few of the foods I used to love.  Also, avoid having cheat days. Instead have unplanned cheat *meals*. I do this often and it helps my sanity. Last night I caught up with some friends and had a meal at a resturant, today I'm back at eating normally and my efforts are hardly worsened.  The final thing I would add, is control what you drink. I've been pretty much booze free for the past 3 months and I think that's the biggest assistance I've had. I drink nothing but water (save for a coffee here and there) and that's made a huge difference.  Definitely hang around /r/loseit, /r/progresspics, /r/fitness or if you're like me /r/fatlogic may also help motivate you. Warning, /r/fatlogic isn't for everyone. If you get motivation to keep doing what you're doing then it's good, if you end up feeling like shit, it's probably not for you.     I'm down 35 lbs as of this morning, I'm in the same boat - but I've only really had one person notice my efforts.   The thing is that I had a huge amount of weight to lose (started at 285) so much of the weight I have lost is likely visceral fat which obviously doesn't show on the outside. I'm down 3 belt buckles and 2 shirt sizes though :)   but I'm already starting to feel better  This is the main point, I feel amazing. I get solid sleep every night. I don't sweat as much anymore and aside from some hunger (extremely manageable) I have all the energy in the world.   Thanks friend, how much have you lost?  My pictures are hidden in my porn folder.    A black man cat**,** called me the other day.   I totally read this sentence with a comma in a strange place.    Australia, most of us live on the fucking coasts. Most of the deadly shit is no where near civilisation. Or if it is (spiders and snakes) they're so skittish that you're never really in danger.   I always go to the doctors office right after work and since I wear the same thing everyday, I just take my shoes off and remove my keys, wallet and phone. Ez. It's not the number which is important, it's the number between the two numbers which is important.   Cunts fucked   A good friend of mine fell asleep while we were watching Devils Advocate for the first time. During the fucked up part with the baby, he sat up, looked at me and said something in Croatian then went back to sleep. Trust me, Croatian sounds demonic.  Fucked me up.   Exactly. I do draw the line with drawing parallels when the person tries to predict what will happen based on these parallels. I don't think GRRM is the type of writer who would make a habit out of doing that.   As someone who grew up playing Fantasy and not really finding 40k any fun - I know what you mean.   I've been playing competitive 8-ball pool for the past 9 years. I love the shit out of it.   I had always loved the game, my dad used to play snooker back in the 80s and he taught my brother and I the basics when we were in our early teens.  The second I hit 18, my brother and I joined a pool club and have been playing ever since. While my brother has fallen out of love with it, I'm still intensely passionate about it and could play for days.  If there is a pool table at a party or pub, i'll be there shootin. I don't hold back, no matter how good or shit you're :)   Washed my mouth out with soap when I said a curse word. Literally, I'm talking getting a flannel, rubbing soap on it and going to town on my teeth. I never learned my cunt fucking lesson.  More generally, I was grounded a lot in highschool.   "Oh man, this freshly cooked dinner is way too hot. I'll need to let it sit for 10 minutes..."   "Your wisdom tooth is now removed, here are your antibiotics."   [something](http://www.something.com/)   Does anyone remember Liero?   God I loved that game.   As someone who has been losing weight for the past 3 months, I've not whispered a single syllable on Facebook about my efforts. Once I reach my goal weight, I'll post up a before and after picture but then I'll never mention it again on there. People don't want to be preached at constantly.     It's kinda the same in Australia. When I had my first doctors visit when I started losing weight, she asked what my goal weight was and I asked her what her opinion was for it. She just kind of sighed and said that nowdays it's difficult to say what the correct weight should be for anyone since the average weight of someone average height is so large.  There is no real go-to figure for what the ideal weight is anymore.   Eat, sleep, fuck, shit, repeat.   Well done my Australian brethren, keep it up   Is this an American culture thing? I can't even fathom my family being anything but supportive. Mum and dad know that I need to get my weight under control and have been nothing but giddy with my achievements. Not only that, my mum has started to drop some weight herself :)  Damn crabs in that damn bucket.  Perhaps explain your goals to them? It may help if they know that you have a certain number you're working towards. I think they might be concerned about you having an ED   Thank you for your sacrifice.   Doesn't mean I don't like the view of the glorious upboats.   Thats almost one third of my total for today (1200) for the next 2 hours  See that's awesome that you get the context of the calories. I find it's so much easier to deny myself an ice cold beer because I know that 180 calories will need to be reduced from somewhere in my food budget to allow for it.   He's talking about the books. The show is a different beast. They can revive the Nights King if they want. GRRM probably just has a nameless and faceless group of others leading the attack in the books.   He's not half as awesome as his brother Garlan, let's face it.   Thanks for the internet points.      I'm sorry to the people who do this, because I know there is quite a bit of work that goes into it.  ....But I don't really like it when people make large posts which show similarities between events in the books and events in other fiction. Cool, so you see a Hamlet reference? I don't really find that interesting or relevant : /  I just skip over it.   Jesus christ, this.  These forums are nigh unreadable after any form of rape occurs on the show. If you're triggered by such horrible things, **DON'T WATCH THE FUCKING SHOW**.  It really is that simple, the show hasn't gotten more brutal. Remember in the first episode we went from brother sister incest to child murder in like 30 seconds.   We're fucking not. That's the damn answer. The internet over reacts CONSTANTLY.  Its fucking fiction people, not only that, it's fiction which is meant to be harsh. I don't get the people who literally screaming IRL.    I knew a dude who would literally just get a footlong chicken fillet and tasty cheese on white bread. It wasn't for health reasons, he just doesn't like things in general apparently.   The upside is that you can wear your old hoodie as a dress and then save some money on new pants.   Pretty much impossible, definitely unhealthy.  Some snap calculations to prove it. To lose 15 pounds in 3 weeks (15*3500)/21 you would need to have a deficit of 2500 calories per day. Meaning you would need to eat 2500 less than your daily expenditure. After putting your information into a TDEE calculator, even with setting it to "intense exercise every day" your expenditure is 2811, so you'd have to eat only 311 calories a day. Which is a great way to kill yourself.  I did this math just to give you context for how weight loss works. Set realistic goals :)   A clever play on words. I don't care how tasteless the context is or who recites it. I will laugh and I will probably hate myself for doing so.   And GRRM has stated that too, I don't have the sauce but there was an article a while back where he was asked a bunch of "who would win" scenarios with LOTR vs ASOIAF characters. One of the matches was 1 unsullied vs 1 Urukai, GRRM basically stated that unsullied were strong in numbers, not for single combat.  **Edit [found the article](http://www.avclub.com/article/watch-george-rr-martin-debate-emgame-of-thronesem--103349)**   I would actually recommend listening to the audio book, the narrator does an incredible job with the voices and it helps with the immersion :)   Because even when they're in packs of 10~ they don't seem to utilise this formation fighting. It's stupid. While we're here - why do they seem to feel pain in the show? That is a selling point of them, that they take medicine to phase out all pain.  We know in the books, Dany wants them to stop taking it but they don't really touch on it in the show.   Sure, 1v1 that's the case. Then why don't they form up and utilise tight formations like phalanxes? You see them all just kinda spread out with spears drawn. They constantly get out flanked and destroyed by nobles with daggers.   Oh right, in the mean time did you keep drinking lots of water?   I can't be the only one who hated Patchface with a passion, right?  Perhaps it's because Roy Dotrice (while an excellent narrator) has a grating voice for him.   I've stopped caring, the unsullied are basically useless in the show   and it subsides naturally after several days?   Christ reddit is overreacting to this. I've read the damn book and I understand why some are frustrated. But to the non readers, it's just a fucking trailer. Without context many of these 'spoiler' moments are just moments.  None of my friends know anything about what will happen.   Mornin' Angle.   I think one of the problems is that abrupt switch of trailer style in the early 00s, from "cheesy fourth wall voice over guy" to "edited spoken word from the movie".  By doing this, you're basically forcing the movie to show its cards more.   Thats the problem, I don't think it's anymore spoilery than any other trailer.  I've read the novel, so I saw shit loads of stuff in there which is a spoiler **only because I know the context**. I've spoken with several mates who've not read it and they have no idea what will happen.   I'm way ahead of you ;)  My diet can keep me covered for another 20 pounds :)   I love the enthusiasm! Let your motivation turn into discipline over time!  Something I will add is to remind you that weight loss is mostly due to diet. So if you feel that exercise 5 days a week is too much, don't burn yourself out over it. Stay on top of what you eat and exercise as much as you can handle!   Yikes, glad you're ok.  This is something I have to worry about. My paternal grand father died of a heart attack at 38 and his son (my paternal uncle) survived a heart attack  at 38. I'm 27 at the moment and no way am I going to let myself go through that with them.   I'm 3 months in and while I've been doing cardio, I've been holding off from doing any strength training till I lost more.  I did my first bout with strength training on the weekend and I had no idea how weak I was. Pushups, situps, planking, squats and lunges. They all showed me how unfit I was haha  But I think it's important to start right away.   If you're like me, then you're currently kicking yourself that you didn't start losing weight earlier. It's the exact same with exercise. I don't want to be at my ideal weight months from now and think "Why didn't I start training sooner? I've lost months of progression".    	120
 I have a similar problem but its not related to anyones attention span.  Most people just care more about being right than they care about having an honest dialog.  Someone who cares about intellectual honesty or participates in the argument to develop a more complete understanding of an issue will always be at a strategic disadvantage when arguing with someone that just wants to win.   Source: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2405420/Amazing-chandelier-inspired-nature-turns-room-forest-using-trick-light.html      I think this is right. In an honest discussion you have to be ready to be convinced. If you believe you have unique access to the capital "t" Truth  you are really just a salesman and do a disservice to yourself, the other party and the dialog itself.   That's one of my favorite responses from conservatives. "It was the national SOCIALIST party!" yeah and North Korea is technically the Democratic People's Republic of Korea...    this exact thing happened to me a few years ago.

As how to be a good and just ruler 3. How to live a virtuous life.     don't forget Chuang Tzu (Zhuangzi / Zhuang Zhou). Probably a close #2 in terms of importance to the tradition.

Smallest crowd ive seen in a while   First, let me just say that Im one of those people who tries to listen to an album 3 or 4 times from beginning to end before I decide what I think about it. Some of my favorite albums I didn't even like on my first listen. So, this may be a little premature since Ive only gotten through it a couple of times, but Im slightly underwhelmed.   If Deltron 3030 is just a colab between Dan the Automator, Kid Koala, and Del then it an adequate to good follow up. In my mind, Deltron 3030 was one of the best concept albums of all time in any genre. Event 2 is missing that epic future apocalypse sound that characterized the first record.    Are my expectations so high that I cant help but be let down? What do you guys think of it so far?    I used to work with a guy at a restaurant who would take food to the back and finish it but only if the food had belonged to a girl and only if he would have made out with her.   SUCSHESH!   he had reached the point of no return     	31
 Can't say I blame him.   To quote the kid in The Wedding Singer, "Piper you a bitch."   After Vee last season, I was glad this season didn't have a major villain, but I kind of like the show when it depicts the ebbs and flows of day to day life inside the prison camp.   I don't know how many times I said "Oh Shit" to myself after I saw that fence repair truck pull-up.       I saw The Cure there. A girl in the row behind me was smoking a joint and tripping on ecstasy - a few times she reached around and just shoved the joint in my mouth. She finally threw up, none hit us (PTL), her boyfriend apologized and took her out of there. Apparently, there was guy at that show who had a medical condition, might have been asthma, but didn't have his medication with him. He had episode/attack and ultimately passed away. I didn't see it, but his friends had communicated a message about it to Jay Lee's "Wake up and Smell the Coffee" the following Friday.   I had moved away from Houston for a good chunk of the 1990s (college, law school, first job), and moved back in June of 2001. Prior to moving back, I had flown down to visit my parents and start arrangements for my move and the cover story in the Continental Airlines magazine was all about Enron and how great a future it would have. I remember thinking to myself, damn, I need to apply for a job there. Glad I didn't do that.   It does get a bit confusing that we've had two murderers in Houston history who were called The Candyman.   In 1990, my high school graduation was also at the Summit. I went to Elsik, Alief ISD used it for both Elsik and Hastings that night.   Before you do anything, I'd seek the advice of people who collect sports memorabilia - find out if they will become more valuable if left in their current condition or if they're restored. If restoring them won't hurt future value, ask who they recommend, they probably know who's best when it comes to restoring stadium seats.   Yep, Minneapolis. Years ago, I heard a music journalist talking about the first time he interviewed Prince and Prince used a very Minnesota polite phrase like "darn tootin'."   Damn, I wish it was Prince. . . . guess the doves at the Houston Zoo aren't crying. [Sorry, couldn't resist.]         TIL they still make disposable cameras.                     Seeing that Piper Kerman is an advocate for women prisoners/inmates, I thought this story was relevant because it highlights one of the greatest sins of the criminal "justice" system in the US, which was sentencing minors as adults. This is a real life example of a 14 year old girl who is sentenced to an adult maximum security prison in Florida. Did you listen to the story? If not, I highly recommend it. I disabled the auto play feature, because that is annoying if you're not ready for it. Use the audio button in the second box, the Act 2 box.   She is a great actor, perfect for the role. Who else can say she's played both Elf's stepmom and Pornstache's Mom?   I've enjoyed his evolution over this season.      Oh but what you thought is even funnier.   I listened to a lot of NPR back then.   I know. I agree.    I'm not sure Eritrea has been in the news much since its war with Ethiopia ended.    All I'm saying is that if this had been a guy/girl situation, there would have been a handful of nutties out there yelling "rape." I don't think it's rape, but in the climate we've been in I couldn't help but think of that issue during that scene. My comment was the Reddit version of thinking out loud.      I had no problem with the scene, I'm just saying b/c of all the damn Games controversy, can't help think what the reaction would be.   He's a RUNNER!   I thought she had a taste of it, but wasn't sure how at that point.   I did not expect Red to stand up for him like that, but she did a damn good job.   I loved Caputo having trying to close out all the porn windows open on his computer.   Do something to save all the poor David Sedari (I sure hope his sister Amy makes him watch that scene)   That one scene totally captured Healy's whole person at the prison.   Favorite line from the episode: "I stand corrected, there is a bedbug infested Koran if you want to read that."   I liked the little scene where the Muslim soldier explained to Bennett why the other Muslim soldiers were not happy about the video. There's a real great miniseries from HBO called "Generation Kill," which captures the homoerotic humor the permeates the military. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-NnHaOUUa8   Bennett had a glimpse into the family he would be marrying him and realized that life wasn't for him, he dumped the crib that was meant for his child.   He wasn't the only one who ran away from the grenade, but yeah, they were making a point about him running.   Of course he wears tightie whities.   She was a great villain in Justified.   Had no problems with the scene, but after all the uproar over Game of Thrones' scenes, I did wonder to myself what would the general response be if that was a man and a woman and not a woman and a woman.   My favorite line from the episode: "Too late to Dyson it out of her."    That was classic, wonder if this was the inspiration https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf2hJQf2YKk  EDIT: Watch closely and you'll see a couple seconds of the exact same belt Bennett had on.         No reason given in the article, always seemed to do great business lunch, but maybe the rent became too damn high - even busy restaurants survive on the thinnest of margins.   So Nerdcore.                                       So typically perfect of someone with her background.   As soon as I finished the episode, I checked my Twitter feed and saw the daily Calvin   Hobbes tweet.   Well, cookie cutter or not, Vee completely reminded me of people I've know, especially in my ex-wife's family.   Probably the most heartbreaking episode so far.    Explains a lot about him and what we've seen in the other seasons.      So will cops.   Now I'm immediately looking up the manual overrides for my newest car (no, not a Corvette, bust still a Chevy).   This article does nothing to convince me that what we are seeing was caused by "fracking."   And, sadly, if its someone claiming to be from a charity you've never heard of, hang up.   As someone with a multiple vehicle household, I feel your pain.   But the men who control the extremist sects within almost all the major religions fear that women will tempt them into raping them.   Such a great man, RIP.         Some good news to report, [Taylor Swift made a very generous donation to help the family with medical bills.](http://www.khou.com/story/news/local/neighborhood/2015/06/11/gofundme-for-walker-county-firefighter-family-injured-in-crash/71076090/)         Based on past experience, odds are that the vehicle is headed to Mexico or Central America.

Sadly, the party in control of this state is beholden to small but very vocal core constituencies, and they've given those constituencies more voting party than everyone else via gerrymandering.   As the economic gulf expands between the haves and the have nots, it's practically become illegal to be poor in the United States.             Hell, when I'm in New York I walk huge amounts. I've walked from Midtown all the way down to Chinatown, and I've walked from Canal (Chinatown) all the way down to the southern tip of Manhattan and then back again. I've also walked the length of the Manhattan Bridge, in a cold drizzle, it was a great walk.   It's young professionals and hipsters who did not grow up here and are only interested in living in an area considered "cool." I'd love to take them back to the 1980s to show them how dangerous those places once were.                     In football and baseball the defenses and offenses operate in such a way that time is needed to rearrange the players on the field (in a way, baseball really doesn't have the same kind of timeouts that exist in other major US sports, it's a slow game and the manager isn't limited to how many times he can go to the mound, they are trying to limit how often the batter can step out of the box.) In other sports, the time outs allotted to each time are used for tactical reasons. But, in general, the bulk of stoppage in play is for television or for review of officiating calls.  Edit: Television takes full advantage of the time needed to rearrange players on the field in football and baseball, and the league officials won't mess with that because television contracts are big source of revenue.                     My therm hit over 100 a couple times yesterday, but that was usually at start-up, the temps dropped a bit after I had been driving for some time.         The old noble class of the Junkers in particular were not fans of Hitler, those involved in the plot to assassinate Hitler primarily came from this class.   The guys in this picture appear to have been SS, so I'm guessing some of them did some very bad things.   They're SS not regular army, odds are some of them were responsible for atrocities.               Actually, renouncing their citizenship might not change anything. ICWA states that it applies to any child deemed a member of tribe by the tribe at issue - judges cannot question a tribe's determination that the child is member.   Every since Weird Science, I've never trusted anyone named Chet.   Don't forget Paul Rudd.   Saving Private Ryan also had quite the cast of actors - Paul Giamatti, Dennis Farina, Ted Danson, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Tom Sizemore, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, and of course Matt Damon and Tom Hanks.   But that scene had my favorite Damien Lewis line of the show: "We're paratroopers Lieutenant. We're supposed to be surrounded."                     When I've traveled I've gotten the opposite response in that people seemed surprised that I am so liberal, though I'm more LBJ liberal than East Coast liberal.   I lived in Wisconsin for a little bit back in the 1990s and people there atomically assumed that I was a Cowboys fan, I had to explain to them that I grew up in Houston and no self respecting Houstonian would root for the Cowboys.      I'm curious about your Spanish Jewish heritage. Was something that was kept secret for a long period of time. I've read about recent generations of old New Mexico families who've learned of their family's Jewish background, it was hidden but there were little traditions connected to their Jewish past.   I call myself a EuroTrash mutt. My ancestors came to the US from many places (so which are no longer the countries they were at the time) and over a period of time stretching from the 1600s to the early 1900s.   It's interesting that on many surveys that ask for racial/ethnic background, they'll have "nonhispanic white" and "hispanic white."    The only thing worse are the pedestrians who jay walk on multilane streets, like Westheimer. And numerous times that I've seen people do this, they were not all that far from a crosswalk.                                 They're like National Park Rangers, but in a city. Done ride alongs in Yosemite, Park Rangers are jacks of all trades.                                                Whenever I hear this song, I want to be sitting in an open air bar in the North Atlantic states, with a nice cold beer.               Well, they have a good attorney (he was in charge of the City of Houston's legal department at on point), and they deserve their day in court. We'll see what happens.      I know how it works, but I prefer to give money directly cause 1. They know best what food items they need, and 2. Money can be used to keep the lights on. I've worked in nonprofit before and know how hard it is to come by money that can be used for overhead, and if you cannot afford to take care of that, you won't be able to carry out your mission.   On the report that was televised this morning, they're claiming the owner was negligent because he knew a fire had been burning inside the walls, let it burn for several hours before calling 911.   Based on the on air report this morning, the negligence claim is that the owner of the property knew that a fire had been burning inside the walls for several hours before calling 911. To give some local perspective, this place was a dump in a high crime area, wouldn't be surprised if the owner took advantage of the fact that there was a fire and wanted it to go up in flames.   Been there, done that.   Do you know the name of the reporter? If so, send them a tweet, they'll probably be able to help.               Actually, was [Buddy Roemer in 2012.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Roemer_presidential_campaign,_2012)       The last Sears I went to was the one in Memorial City Mall, you could  tell nobody that worked there gave a shit, clothes were in bizarre piles, and large appliances that were for sale practically blocked entire walking areas.   Yep, there's actually one in the Randall's strip at West Bellfort and Kirkwood, which seems like an odd location for a Palais Royal, but it's has been there for years now.         Back in the late 80s and early 90s, West Oaks was my go to mall for most of my shopping (with Sharpstown a close second). Been a long time since I've gone to West Oaks, but last time I was there, was shocked how dead it seemed. [I also remember when Memorial City Mall was dead and Town   Country Mall was packed, now Town   Country is gone, but Memorial City has been revived.]   Another reason why it's better to just donate money directly to the Food Bank.

 There was some kind of promising [news](http://www.sciencealert.com.au/news/20141706-25695.html) on this recently.   What's equally terrifying is the dental bill afterwards.

It also has grappling hooks. [This article](http://www.nature.com/news/female-insect-uses-spiky-penis-to-take-charge-1.15064) from Nature includes this gruesome tidbit:   When researchers tried to pull apart two mating insects, the female was gripping so tightly that the male was accidentally ripped in half, leaving his genitalia still attached to the female.     It also depends on the amount wanted. 25 grams of the L-glucose is $1565, way less than 25 times the price of 1 gram. For these amounts the "50% more expensive" stat will be more accurate.   Seems about right. You can buy a gram of L-glucose [here](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/g5500?lang=en region=US) for $84.90. Gold is currently $42 a gram, so yeah at least 50% more than gold by weight.  Google tells me that there are 39 grams of sugar in a can of coke, so a can of left handed coke would cost over $3300.   ^(edit: to all those pointing out that 84 is 100% more than 42: this post is intended as a back-of-the-envelope sanity check on the information in the post title. Hence "at least". Many factors can influence the relative costs, including the amount and source of L-glucose, as has been pointed out in comments.)

 yeah, i send emails to an address like that all the time but when i try to send it form IFTTT it seems to just chop off the beginning.    The email I am trying to send is to a dlist and the format of the email is something like +dlist+~orgname/dlist/group@school.edu however, when ifttt sends it to gmail it gets sent as group@school instead of the entire dlist.   Perhaps you could do a cascading sort of notification system where if it is raining in a certain area it triggers an event, and that event will always trigger an iOS notification that has the zip code it will be raining in. Not sure if it will work but just a thought.   As title says, the trigger is the start of a calendar event but the recipe has never been run and many events should have triggered it. It is on a shared calendar could this be the reason it is not working?   	4
    It seems like vampires would have the ability to give people back the memories theyve blocked I dont like that Hoyt didnt get to remember he and Jasons youth together, but then he seems more confident then he did before. Hmm  And why make it seem as though Bill was possibly turning into a Human again?  Why make Eric interesting and compassionate to others; not only to those hes in love with or made, in the last two episodes more than the whole series?  That Bridgette bitch had 0 right to be angry with Hoyt because the moment she set eyes on Jason her eyes bugged the fuck out and she was mind fucking him the whole time. And she cheated? Thats her biggest darkest secret? She cheated on a test? For a biologist she lacked a lot of depth. Jason deserved better.  And while I despise Sarah Newlin she was quite a character, Im disappointed with what they did with her, I wish Pam would have taken her up on her offer and then opened a vampire girl brothel or something. I think Sarah would have just changed her identity again and loved her new life.  Glad Arlene still had her new man though!  Favorite part of the whole series: When Eric finally gave a piece to Ginger               nice gifs   it was awesomeeeeee!!!   In my opionion not every character needs to have a romantic side...some just need to be `doers`..or maybe that`s the way the writers wanted to build daryl`s character, so that later we will be happy when he gets involved with someone (female or not)      Nice! Maybe I`ll be scared at first..but I`ll appreciate it              	15

 I love them!!  :)   I have thought about meditation before, just haven't been sure about the best way to go about doing it. My mind is so loud and always worrying about something. It has been suggested to me before though   Your completely right. Finding out someone you really care about maybe doesn't care about you as much is something I'm not sure I can handle right now lol. But in time I hope I find my true friends too   Thank you   I'm hoping I'll be able to make a few acquaintances like that if I go to a meeting. I don't want to talk to anyone that I care about losing on the topic of what a piece of shit I am   She never offers me anything and just sticks to her tabs which I'm allergic to so she isn't bringing anything in the house that I would want. Neither of us is good at dealing with stress is where the problem comes in. She's amazing to talk to and always listens so she really is a good friend. She's also my roommate lol. I'm going to really try. If I talk to my doctor it will cut my main source off, that will do wonders for my effort in quitting I'm sure   Thank you for your time though, I appreciate hearing from an outside person on this. I don't tell my boyfriend about the extent of the issue, and my best friend has even more of a problem with it than I do   I've had a lot of anxiety sense I was about 13, mostly due to a crappy home life. The days I don't take the pills I feel like I need to smoke, or drink, and I hate liquor and never liked myself when I smoked bud before this. I know its a problem. I'm just hoping the more I hear things like this, the more it will wedge itself in my brain. Along with the anxiety, I also have obsessive tendencies so breaking habits is one of the hardest things for me to do, I've even been hospitalized for my obsessive skin picking when it caused a staff infection and I still pick at my skin. I'm going to really try to find another alternative for pain management and I hope I'll be brave enough to talk to my doctor about my fear that I probably shouldn't be taking these pills. Its hard to breathe just thinking about doing that   Really sorry for using you, a complete stranger, as a sounding board  .  I just don't have anyone else at the moment   Its also difficult to make myself do something about it when I feel like I'm functioning better when I take the pills. I talk to people and I'm more friendly. And its the only way I get motivated to do anything. I'll actually get up and clean the house for example and I feel like writing again, which I used to love to do but lost all motivation for. I don't want to lose my motivation and I feel like I only have it when I'm taking the pills. Its really scary for me to think about  	10
 Thanks for the suggestion love! I have tried that before...last time didn't go so red hot.   I also suffer from sleep paralysis and there was actually a time I was having nightmare, I told myself it was all just a dream and managed to wake myself up, only problem was...I couldn't move.   I have also suffered from this since I was little, but it very rarely happens. The first time it happened to me I was so scared because my eyes were open in my pitch black room, the only thing I could move was my pinky on my left hand.  And being a little brat still I was convince that I must be dying and cried my eyes out silently because I couldn't even make a sound. Finally passed back out from crying and woke up the next day fine.  I don't freak out as bad anymore, but sometimes I get this overwhelming feeling that something bad is going to happen, which I hear is pretty common for people suffering from it.  Which makes sense because not being able to move or make a sound...trapped in your body. Ugh...! Gives me the willies!   	1

I have already written and told the magazine that rabbits are not disposable Easter decorations and that the dumping situation is bad enough without their irresponsible encouragement. Here is the link to contact them if you wish to add your voice: http://www.marthastewart.com/contact-us-form or Editor's email: living@marthastewart.com         that paw!   Thanks!   Happy Gotcha Day to the Princess Lady Guinevere Snugglebottom. She was our foster for 5 days before the papers got signed! :D         She is absolutely in love with him. I'm ok - but he is the best thing in the world as far as she is concerned.       Enough people have enough of a soft spot to see what you consider fugly as character.  These buns will look good as new once treated though. It is actually really amazing how well rabbits heal and how fast. And after 1 molt (which happen multiple times a year) a stained rabbit has a brand new sparkling white coat. A lot of white rabbits come to the shelter urine stained from being kept in tiny neglected hutches. They look good as new after a molt.    People take animals with all kinds of disabilities - I saw a lady who took a rabbit whose ear had been cut with scissors the other day.   I have a friend who rescues bull terriers - many from terrible conditions. His current dog has scars all over his face.    you can use liquid bandage to provide a surface barrier. Vitamin a d ointment without fragrance added is also helpful.  HealX is made for sore hocks - but is expensive and takes weeks before results take effect.   It looks like she is claiming her kill    Aside from the general awfulness of how people use animals - this serves as a good warning for anyone posting on classifieds. Make sure you are only sharing information you want public!   I usually just tell them they're SO creative. They usually don't have much besides their one stupid unoriginal joke - so it isn't like they are going to go on about recipes to me and require much more than that. It shows "I don't think you're being cute or funny, I have heard it before, and frankly you aren't even clever." Convo usually moves on pretty fast from there.  As far as guests and my buns not wanting to be chased - I usually gather up my rabbits when guests arrive and introduce them - let guests pet them while I hold them so they can meet each other.    Beautiful picture!   To my knowledge, trancing only occurs when   1. The head of the rabbit is lowered below the heart while on their back  2. The neck is bent back and not supported properly  It is possible to hold a rabbit on its back without trancing it.   I also do an arm cradle with bigger bunnies so their butt is in my lap and their shoulders rest against the crook of my left elbow (semi-reclined) - I wrap my forearm over them and use the left hand to hold the feet I am working with or to pet them and calm them.      http://www.howcast.com/videos/514678-How-to-Trim-Your-Rabbits-Nails-Pet-Rabbits  I haven't done this but it looks cool   smallpetselect.com and rabbitholehay.com are places I order from   Celery can be dangerous if they don't chew through the strings and it clogs their GI tract.

 Beautifully put! I definitely think that I am going to wait three years!   Thanks!  I am starting to see that many, experienced teachers are suggesting waiting until year 3.

    Yes! I hope we find people to craft with! Id definitely cone to your tent to make some kandi :) let me know!   Not a problem haha. Ill just give my boyfriend my order. He's 22 so he'll have no problem.   Holy shit that is a lot!!   Perfect! Not worried about the neighbours, more excited to get to know them actually! Honestly none of us would imagine bringing drugs over the border... i only plan on bringing myself, my supplies and a whole ton of kandi! :) I hate leaving g the purchasing up to chance though, ypu just never quite know who to trust..  I'm really happy to hear they allow alcohol into the camp though! That's perfect for us. Its also nice to hear you can carry alcohol around with you and dont have to stay in the pit, knowing that it'll be no problem getting some. Thanks so much for the informative reply! Love when experienced people are willing to help out :)   Myself, my boyfriends and a group of about 10 friends are going to be going to electric forest this year and we're absolutely ecstatic! Id like to say that firstly we're all really interested in meeting as many of you as possible and creating new friendships and experiences with this! :) it looks like there is so much music and culture to explore at this festival and that is definitely part of what got us so interested.    So we've already read the festival guide that's on this subreddit and it is SO helpful so thank you to those that helped to put it together. We made a list of our own based on some of the points on there. But we still have some alternate questions that either weren't answered, or were answered very loosely. Firstly I was wondering, how much room do they allow for your tent/shade tent? If you were going with 10 people, would they allow you to put 3 or 4 tents in the same area with a shade tent in the middle or there abouts?   Also, as Canadians not all of us are legal drinking age in the States. About half of us are, where as I and a few others are only 20 and won't be able to drink there. Is it possible to bring your own beer in and get it past the car check? How thorough are they and what do you suggest for success? Is it possible to get a beer from the bars on the festival grounds if you're not 21? Im assuming its like a beer pit and you can't.  Our last question regards the availability of substances at the festival. Since we must cross the border to get into Michigan there is no chance we will be bringing any substances like weed or MDMA with us. Though we could hide it well and it would be unlikely to get fully searched, if they found anything it would be automatically considered trafficking and that would ruin a lot more than just the festival haha. None of us are willing to risk it. My boyfriend and I have already purchased a test kit which I think is essential, but how would you prevent yourself from getting ripped off on different substances in the first place? If anyone knows of trustworthy people at the festival we'd love a pm about it, it would make us feel a lot more secure regarding the whole thing. I also understand that these things are more expensive in the states than in Canada, and if anyone has information on that, it would also be appreciated :)  And really that's all we have to ask! As I said, the guide was really well put together and answered almost everything. Mostly we had some Canadian specific questions :) I look forward to some answers from all of you experienced foresters, thanks everyone! :) see you in the forest!   Not all women like them, but if that the women who do, REALLY do.   I saw this on the front page something like 5-8 days ago with the same title... I feel like im going crazy how does this have upvotes at all!      Damn happy you posted and explained this. Im not sure how this isnt really common knowledge for adults! Or for women at least. Lady parts are a sensitive mistress!   This. I personally don't have this problem, but lightly rinsing and scrubbing it with just water is a common suggestion for women who are prone to yeast infections. Vaginas do a lot of self cleaning, so technically speaking you dont need soap, just a good wash!   Could you slow down? You're going fast.   The first sit was about 3.5 hours and the second one was only maybe 2 hours. A little less even.   I did in my last post a week ago! The picture had been previously posted on reddit so I know it is known, and I have no shame in discussing it when the original art is posted. If it were a secret I'd try to flag these posts or some other kind of ridiculous internet show of shame.   If you frequent /r/tattoos often enough you'll begin to realize that a lot of people's inspiration comes from other sources, just this week there was a guy who was on the front page for a couple of days with a watercolour painted style pheonix. He posted the picture he was inspired by and they were nearly identical. It's like a boost of creativity or an outline for what you might want, a lot of styles designs and pieces I see here are definitely partly inspired by tattoos before them. It would be ignorant to say I was the first one to work off of someone elses design for their own idea.  Also, if you look at her drawing and my tattoo the execution is very different, the only truly similar thing is the pose of the bird and I was very sure of that.  As I said, I found it as a chalk drawing and looked her up to find the original piece. She said she didn't mind it being used IF changed for a tattoo. So I used different colours and styles on it. I was sure not to tattoo the exact drawing on my body.  Edit: added context  	15
 Dari er sdan set stadig farsi. Det ville vre det samme som at sige at man i USA snakker amerikansk istedet for engelsk.   Mine forldre kom fra mellemsten til Danmark i midten af 80'erne. De fik specialundervisning og lrte dansk efter nogle r. Der har vret rigeligt med ressourcer for drabsmanden og hans familie til at lre det danske sprog.  Kan ikke udtale mig om din historie. Mske din lrer kontaktede kommunen og skrev sig p at hjlpe dig med at lre dansk s du ikke behvede flytte skole?  Danmark har altid haft et integrationsprogram for udlndinge til at integrere sig og lre det danske sprog.   Ja, det var der. Jeg er samme alder som drabsmanden. Da jeg gik i folkeskole var der en gut som kom til Danmark fra England. Efter 1 r kunne han kommunikere uden problemer. Efter 2 r talte han flydende dansk, som var han fdt her.  Der er ingen undskyldninger for at man efter 22 r i Danmark siden man var 3, stadig taler s drligt dansk at man har brug for en tolk. Det er drlig integration.   Der findes special undervisning p skolerne til 2-sprogede brn.   Tvivler p at en folkeskolelrer ville skifte over til engelsk i undervisningen.   http://ekstrabladet.dk/112/forsvarer-kamillas-drabsmand-er-velintegreret/5631578  "Han har en datter og familie i Danmark. Han er velintegreret, han har fine papirer fra sin ungdomsskoleuddannelse, han har danske venner og kolleger fra sit arbejde p Frslev Tr, siger Erbil Kaya."  http://ekstrabladet.dk/112/nu-taler-kamillas-drabsmand/5621594  "Selv om den afghansk fdte Samayullah har opholdt sig i Danmark siden tre-rs alderen taler han s drligt dansk, at han er ndt til at have en tolk at sttte sig til."               Ah okay, gotcha. Jeg tror mange er forvirrede over det da det er 18 r i USA.   S en person p 40 kan have sex med en person p 15 uden det er strafbart eller hvordan?   S er det da godt at vi har s fine initiativer som fremdriftsreformen som hjlper de studerende med at f en meget bedre ingenirmssig uddannelse med rig mulighed for erfaringer indenfor virksomheder ved siden af deres studier.... N nej, der skete s det modsatte.   Jeg har altid troet at hvis man som voksen har sex med en person under 18 s var det strafbart men s forstr jeg ikke hvad den seksuelle lavalder s betyder? Betyder det at en voksen godt m vre i et forhold med en over 15?   Why do you hate it?      I go to a University in Denmark. Our school recently made an article about a recent paper from Saudi Arabia that was filled with errors and made up sources. I've heard many of such stories in the past. I'd say they definitely aren't on the same level as Western students. And I'm not just basing that on the students. I'm also basing that on the fact that their university would even publish a research like that internationally without even doing basic things like checking the sources.  I think that's a really big shame for those other students in the region who want to do good and don't want to cheat.   Proton Jon, NCS, and Chugga for guest grumps.   *circlejerk intensifies*   If anything I think this makes it more sad. It must be really scary to not have a safety net and the consequences it might have, like losing your house, not being able to pay the bills, food, etc.   Det er jo slet ikke fordi at de studerende er nglen til Danmarks fremtidige velfrd eller noget.   So a private company is allowed to refuse black people?  	22

How can they not be trained after 14 years?   Note that he references the notorious RP hater James Kirchick.   In a Pattonesque way, Bernanke said he found dealing with the crisis incredibly stimulating because he was able to draw on a lifetime of academic study about the causes of the Great Depression and how to avoid another one. **I feel that the work I did as a academic paid off and that I was able to use that to help solved these problems,** he said. Thats very satisfying, though its not an experience I would voluntarily repeat.

If they badly want those bases, finance it out of their paychecks but not ours."   One of my favorite Presidents.  There are no, and never will be, any "good Presidents."   Right now, we only have one side of the story.  When I watched the video, I couldn't tell whether the guy was pointing a gun or just pointing.  I think we need to wait to see if what the police are saying is actually true before we accept their statements as fact.   Seems like we get a piece like this every year or so.  Of course, Bloomberg neglects to state that RP has been buying gold since it was $35/oz.   Never loses his humanity?  He turns out to be the best marksman in Iraq, serving four tours and becoming known as the most lethal sniper in American history, with **166 confirmed kills**. He is so unstoppable a killer that opposing Iraqi forces call him **The Devil of Ramadi** and offer a massive reward for his death.   And why didn't they add "mentally ill?"  **Hamilton had a history of paranoid schizophrenia**, and Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said in October that Manney violated policy in dealing with the mentally ill by instigating a physical confrontation with Hamilton and coming up behind him.   I could have sworn that Obama said there would be no grounds troops in Iraq.  Oh, that's right, he did:  [To The Troops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ5lm_H0NcY)  [To The Press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu9YqE3QZzc)  [To The American People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3ME9sVjwQ4)  [From The White House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv8Gu3jmibQ)  [Before Boarding The Presidential Helicopter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsGV5oFfnZc)      I am not sorry that President Obama has ordered drone strikes on hundreds of terrorist suspects hiding in Pakistan, Yemen and other places. **I am not sorry he has done so despite the fact that the strikes inevitably have killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of their associates, many of whom were either innocent of wrongdoing or had committed no crime** deserving of death from 30,000 feet. This is the nature of war.   This is an original article from Salon.com; it's not rehosted content.   Wow, what a great comment.  I'm assuming you're a teenager, so I'll give you a pass this one time.   "Political sniping?"  Actually, I agree with you, both parties are equally culpable.   Oops..   Nice comment.  Thanks!   Opening on Jesus's birthday.  I wonder who picked that date?   But Ron Paul is a decent man, his son is not.   I feel so sorry for Ron.  What a disgrace.   Great comment.  Thanks!    What do they do with our young people? They send them all around the world, getting involved in wars and telling them they have to have democratic elections, he told RT. But here at home, we dont have true Democracy. We have a monopoly of ideas that is controlled by the leaders of two parties. And they call it two parties, but its really one philosophy.    Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a federal law in 2013 that bans the propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations to minors," only a few months after the iPhone monument was installed. Putin has since argued that the law is not discriminatory and is intended only to keep children safe.   This is the actual headline: U.S.: "**Palestinian**-American minor killed by Israeli military"  Why add the qualifier?  Does that make it okay for the Israelis to kill a kid?    Awesome comment.  Thanks!   "I would think shed be pretty average, pretty mediocre, pretty much for war," Paul added, when asked what kind of president he thought Clinton would be. "I dont think she would provide any change whatsoever in a positive sense."   U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!   This appears to be an original story on Raw Story.  I don't understand why it was removed.   This was the best Ron Paul ad of 2011-2012.   Was his plan to destroy his father's legacy?   The United States is providing logistics and operational support, including hundreds of thousands of units of personal protective equipment, mobile labs, water treatment units, disinfectant, basic supplies and food assistance, he said. **If Congress approves the additional funding, it will bring the U.S. total commitment to over $250 million.**   Rand Paul is Satan.  What a murderous lunatic.   No offense, but I think that's the stupidest comment I have ever read on reddit.   I have issues with both.   What's he supposed to do?  How 'bout he stops killing men, women and children who have never, nor ever could, threaten The Homeland?  Do you even remember that Obama was first elected because the American people perceived him as the Peace Candidate?  Or, that he's a Nobel Peace Prize winner?   Red alert?   Says the fella who uses robots to kill women and children across the globe   The American government today conducts targeted killings outside of internationally recognized theaters of conflict against folks **believed to be** terrorists. I support that.   "We sincerely regret the loss of the lives and injury to innocent Afghan civilians caused by the insurgents in this tragic incident." NATO said in a statement to The Associated Press.   Behind the scenes, however, **the U.S. factories that produce Hellfire missiles began "working seven days a week in order to meet the need and push them out to Iraq,"** a senior administration official said.   Or, America will kill people to prevent people from possibly being killed.   I'd rather have him twiddling his thumbs than [killing Afghan children](http://news.antiwar.com/2014/08/06/us-led-airstrike-kills-afghan-civilians/), but hey, that's just me.   You try to help the people with their suffering, the doctor said recently in his Gaza City living room, lined with psychology textbooks. Its totally different when you have the same experience. You lose six from your family  three brothers, your mom, one of your nephews, your sister-in-law. Its really  he paused, red-eyed  unexpected.   What a frightening headline.   Paul's son, Sen. Rand Paul, has also been an outspoken critic of NSA surveillance but has stopped short of saying that Snowden deserves clemency, though he has publicly advocated a lighter sentence than life in prison.   The freshman Kentucky senator has long complained its an unfair knock, and **an unfair guilt by association situation with his father, former Rep. Ron Paul.**  But Mike says the senator is planning a high-profile pitch at the National Defense University this fall to address his critics, and attempt to reposition himself on the foreign policy spectrum.  Hes going to argue that hes smack in the middle - the same place that George H.W. Bush was, that Reagan was, and that Ike was, said Allen.   Wouldn't you love to be her husband?   Webbs latest allegations and the other new evidence in the matter could also have implications for the Texas governor, Rick Perry, a strong supporter of the death penalty and a possible Republican presidential candidate.  In 2004, Perry refused to temporarily stay Willinghams execution despite the report of a leading forensic expert that sharply disputed the finding of arson by a Texas deputy fire marshal. Perrys administration has also repeatedly undercut the authority of a state Forensic Science Commission, which agreed that the arson finding relied on flawed analysis. Defending his handling of the case in 2009, the governor declared that Willingham was a monster.   Bill Clinton was responsible for the death of [500,000 children](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4PgpbQfxgo) in Iraq.  Do you honestly believe that he gave a sh*t about 300 civilians in Afghanistan?   What's with these [major universities](http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2011/01/18/professor-mcchrystal/) hiring murderers and war criminals?   Great comment.  Thanks   So there are three factions?  The rebels, the government and the extremists?   Go to the Stasi headquarters museum.  You can visit Erich Mielke's office which looks exactly as it did in 1989.   "Sharpshooter?"  Is that kind of like a sniper?   Looks like the [American people after Obama killed Osama](http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01302/celebration02_1302873a.jpg).   Killing people, on the other hand, is just peachy keen.   If Burma succeeds, the president told West Point cadets recently, **we will have gained a new partner without having fired a shot**. But two years after Obama made a historic visit to the Southeast Asian nation, the achievement is in jeopardy.  What a strange thing to sayWhat does he mean?   Check out the photo of Bales.   Or, alternatively, the eight Presidents who personally killed the most innocent people.   What a horrible person Rand Paul is.  How could you grow up in Ron Paul's house and be this misguided and evil?   "I think it is clear by now: Israel has shown remarkable restraint. It possesses a military with clear superiority over that of its Palestinian neighbors, yet it does not respond to threat after threat, provocation after provocation, with the type of force that would decisively end their conflict. But sometimes restraint can work against you. Sometimes you just have to say, enough is enough."   And her own parents narc'd on her:  Conley's parents contacted the FBI, telling them that their daughter's beliefs were far more extreme than they'd previously thought. Their daughter, they told the FBI, had started to hide her Internet activity, too.   Wow, what an insightful comment.  Thanks!   This modern man, Cheney, however needs no kingship, no ornate palaces, no personally-owned colony like the Congo; Cheney's writ is the world. It is all of humankind that Cheney would torture, enslave, murder, or plunder if it were required. And Cheney is the ultimate arbiter of whether it is required.     The President's decision to send 300 advisers to Iraq is a good first step, but their ability to deter ISIS will be limited unless we eventually engage in airstrikes to target their leaders as well as the supply lines that they use to transfer weapons and fighters between Syria and Iraq.  I wonder who wrote this garbage for him?   Rep. J. Randy Forbes (R-VA) is the Chairman of the House Armed Services Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee and co-chair of the Congressional China Caucus.   I would stop talking about withdrawing from Afghanistan, Cheney said. We ought to stay in Afghanistan. We shouldnt be scaling back.   Rep. Andy Harris, Maryland Republican, sponsored the amendment and argued that marijuana use can negatively affect the brain development of children.   A war was created in Afghanistanthere was no war, there is no war, and I would never agree to be at war in my own country. I would never be a commander in chief fighting a war among my own people. No. I am happy I wasnt, and I will not be.   Why the hyphenated qualifier of "al Qaeda-American?"  Does this make it easier to justify the killing?   What about their "safe operating space" in Germany and the United States?   MARCO RUBIO: Well, if you look at what happened before 9/11, the reason why al Qaeda was able to carry out the 9/11 attacks is because they had a safe operating space in Afghanistan that the Taliban had given them.   Cheney says hes worried that as troops are withdrawing from Afghanistan the U.S. wont be able to stop terrorists from getting their hands on nuclear weapons in neighboring Pakistan.   But he still doesn't rule out military action: "And while **we may not completely rule out airstrikes**, there are many questions that need to be addressed first."   More than a decade  and $5 billion  later, here's the GTMO scorecard: eight convictions, one of them overturned by a civilian court; six others face trial; and 779 detainees have been transferred to other countries, including the five Taliban members recently traded for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.   Then why did you send them arms?   Except, apparently, Barack Obama.   Since ISIS seized Mosul, I've been getting asked a lot whether I feel as though our fight in Iraq "wasn't worth it" or whether I think my time there was "wasted."  I don't.  **I am a Marine and I would have gone anywhere my country sent me.**   Great comment.  Thanks.  I'm especially impressed with your use of the word "retards."  That alone proves that you're smarter than everyone else.   "They always said that Bush and Gitmo and Cheney were the greatest recruitment tools for Al-Qaeda.  Wrong.  It's Obama and his stand-down isolationist, appeasement view.  The perception of United States weakness is the greatest motivating factor they have."     The President has a range of options. U.S. military and intelligence personnel can airdrop riverine craft into the Euphrates, or attempt to co-opt, cripple, and compromise adversary communication networks.   Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.   Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said a U.S. partnership with longtime foe Iran makes him uncomfortable but likened it to the United States working with Soviet leader Josef Stalin in World War II against Adolf Hitler. He says the United States has to do what it can to keep Baghdad from falling to insurgents.   And while the Iraqi leadership deserves "much of the blame," a relatively small presence of American troops in Iraq would have been a wise choice to keep the fighting at bay.   How to kill people?   Baghdad is going to be overrun. The Green Zone is going down. - U.S. intelligence official   Not a troll, just thought the headline was hilarious.   Please watch and then compare to what he's saying now about Afghanistan, Syria, etc.   I am not telling you they dont have the ability to go back and get involved [in the Afghan conflict], he said. But they also have an ability to get killed doing that. I dont think anybody should doubt the capacity of the United States of America to protect Americans.   **Over the course of its yearlong deployment, the platoon would lose none of its two dozen soldiers.** But their battalion lost men, and many soldiers have blamed the search for Sergeant Bergdahl for some of those deaths.   The reason is that **we put a value on individual human life the way that the barbarians on the other end of the table dont**, he said. And thats why we always end up with unequal swaps.   Defeated on the battlefield in two back-to-back wars, we can vent our frustrations on this sad, lonely and nearly-starved young man.   He's a fucking traitor  And you are a murder-advocating fool.  Go away.   Frankly, we dont give a shit why he left, one White House official said at the time. Hes an American soldier. We want to bring him home.

My guess is that McCain has no idea who these detainees even are.  Sounds like talking points from his neo-con overseers.   A former American Special Operations officer said there was a broader lesson for any future Libya training mission: **The take-away here is theyre going to take a lot more adult supervision** to make sure the checks and balances are in place, so you dont have outside militia taking over.   Slater was reminded of his own vulnerability after an army fuel truck came rumbling down a highway ramp, crossed the median and rolled over a civilian hatchback. Dispatched to the scene to do the recovery work, the Marines found themselves completely exposed. The night was clear, the lights of Fallujah shone brightly in the distance, the moon was full and insurgents could easily pick them off with sniper fire or a bomb detonated on the road underneath. Meanwhile, the hatchback had been crushed to a height of inches, and **the Marines were tasked with extracting what was left of the Iraqi mother and child inside.**   Yeah, that was painful to watch.  I think he thought people would applaud when he said America would be in Afghanistan past 2014.   Watch the video.  He is so pathetic without his teleprompter.   You didn't answer my question.   So if I were smart, I would think like you?   You are a man of many reddit IDs.   Holder acknowledged the deaths of four U.S. citizens in drone strikes in Yemen, including Awlakis 16-year-old son, but said that only Awlaki had been a target. **The others were killed incidentally in strikes against other targets.**   "I took a helicopter ride from occupied territories across ... and just felt, personally, how extraordinary that was to understand the military risk that Israel faces every day," Christie said.   I have a son getting ready to enter the Navy this month and people often ask me: "Are you OK with him entering such a dangerous profession?" For me the answer is easy: I am honored and humbled by his eagerness to defend his country and stand up for the democratic principles of the Constitution.   I wonder if he mourns the million people he killed in Iraq...   I wouldnt be waiting for some kind of permission from some guy named Goodluck Jonathan, he added, referring to the president of Nigeria.   Great comment.  Thanks   **Al Qaeda still seeks weapons of mass destruction. If acquired, they will immediately deploy them to try and mass murder American civilians.** This underscores the overriding importance of supporting a continuing U.S. military presence in Afghanistan past 2014  one that will guarantee our ability to crush Al Qaeda central.   There is no such thing as a "good" politician.   Written by Ron Paul hater James Kirchchick.   Yemen has become among the least permissive environments for U.S. officials in recent years. American military and intelligence personnel have played a crucial role in counter terrorism efforts in Yemen, regularly striking suspected militants with drones, and providing support to the countrys fledgling security forces.   What if the girls were Swedish?  Would she make the same statement and send Special Ops and the FBI into Sweden to rescue them?   "Dancing" at "Club Naked?"  Is that the latest euphemism for visiting a prostitute?   Rick Santorum is the perfect face for the GOP.   What a strange headline:  1.  U.S. "officers" rather than "Special Ops Commando" and "CIA agent."  2.  "Armed Civilians." Why not use the usual "terrorists," "insurgents" or "rebels?"  It just seems to me that that headline was written by someone who is interested in developing a certain storyline. Or, maybe it's just a really bad headline...   If you're Rand Paul's campaign manager, you may want to ditch the hipster sunglasses.   Please watch the video.   Can you imagine Ron Paul doing this?   In her statement, Rice defended her record, saying that she was honored to serve her country and that she had "defended America's belief in free speech and the exchange of ideas." But she said she didnt want to detract from the spirit of the commencement ceremony.

But she said she didnt want to detract from the spirit of the commencement ceremony.   U.S. taxpayers have spent $7.5 billion over the past 12 years on counternarcotics efforts inside Afghanistan, but the withdrawal of troops has prompted a massive surge in the drug trade, Americas top watchdog inside the country warned in a report Wednesday.   A glass door was smashed at VIP Cannabis, 2949 W. Alameda Ave. in Denver. Video from a television news helicopter showed agents dressed in marked DEA clothing had worked to open two safes at the shop. The store, which is operated by Gerardo and Luis Uribe, has a "closed for remodeling" sign in the front window.   He died in "Baraki Barak" district.  How appropriate.   Just out of curiosity, who are "you guys?"   Spoken like a true winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.   Palin went on to criticize politicians that have spoken out in favor of cutting military benefits and **those who break bread with those who think it makes no difference how our military heroes died in Benghazi or anywhere else trying to protect America**, a possible swipe at Hillary Clinton, who made a similar statement about the Benghazi attacks as secretary of State.  The guys who died in Benghazi were "trying to protect America?"  Huh?

Thanks, Steve   Sorry, I just wanted to highlight the quote to show that Israeli influence over U.S. foreign policy was recognized even shortly after the creation of Israel.

Well.. when I think back about all the time I've spend watching this series, my fondest memories are from the very beginning.  The first episode filled me with awe and wonder at the huge magical world engrossing me. The scope and scale of it were staggering.  Every character was immediately intriguing. I had a friend (a book reader) who would stop every few minutes and explain in a little more detail what was going on.  I was so curious and had so many questions!  I still remember my heart pounding when I saw Bran fall.  I've introduced so many people to this show and I always love rewatching the first few eps.   So you weren't already sitting down to watch the episode when they started?      Safe limits huh? Tell that to my dental fluorosis.   what's interesting about it?   OMG, at least credit [the artist](http://therealmcgee.tumblr.com/)!   I hope they use it next season when talking about Tywin's death.   I hope there is a Tysha reveal in the books.  Maybe Martin will even do it just to spite D D for changing things!   How about a third chance?! This book sounds perfect for me!   Hello!  I'm looking for some help troubleshooting starting my engine.  First of all, I can rule out the battery, the glow plugs, and the starter.  All are new and just replaced.  I also just attempted to replace the fuel filter because I had a suspicion that the fuel is not flowing properly.  When I got to the step about bleeding air from the fuel by opening the air valve and cranking the engine, nothing came out of the hose.  Any help would be appreciated.  I can take pics and report back as needed. Thanks!   Yeah, I've already read the wikipedia article, thanks.  The blog has a link to a ["document"](http://www.jfklancer.com/CIA.html) hosted on a site called jfklancer.com. It's titled "CIA Document 1035-960 Concerning Criticism of the Warren Report".  When you google that all you find are more blog posts, but nothing that indicates that this is an official document.   What?  You're the one who made the claim, I'm asking for a source.   I've heard this before, and it makes sense, but I can't find a source to back this up. Can you help?   (I upvoted you for the reasons you stated above.)   Where is the announcement thread?   Or Margery pops up and says "Oh look the pie!"   Considering that scene is not in the books, it kept me on the edge of my seat as well! (It's not a spoiler to say something that's NOT in the books right?)   No one expec.... ah nevermind.      Good question.  Beric was sent out by Ned, but the Brotherhood Without Banners swear allegiance to no king.   Yeah, what's happening to Theon after book two is only implied, but not seen in ASOS.  So when they showed all that stuff in Season 3/4 about what was happening to him I was pretty shocked, having only read up to AFFC at the time.  I don't think the "Reek"/Theon thing is mentioned in the books until ADWD.   Theon, for one.   I don't want 13 episodes and here's why: They are already plowing through the books (with book 5 plotlines of Daenerys and Theon).  More episodes means more time for them to fill and more invented stuff.  Generally the plotlines that HBO writes are really weak compared to what is in the books.  So more episodes would probably mean more of that stuff.  I don't think they will start including more characters from the books because they are concerned that the show is already too complicated for most people to keep track.   ug   Show producers should spend more time reading our subreddit to find all their inconsistencies!   There already is a thread for show vs. book discussion.  Also the mods posted something recently about how book readers should react to guesses that are correct.  Basically, just ignore them.    #samforking   I'm not being a D is and this is not just a semantical argument.  If one is interested in driving a "zero emission" vehicle it's probably because they care about their carbon footprint and they have real concerns about their environmental impact.  How the electricity is actually generated is of paramount importance.  The point in the production and distribution of the energy where the fossil fuels are burned (where the emissions happen) is actually the irrelevant thing.   This is good, but this article refers to these vehicles as "zero emissions" which is a bit misleading.  Just because there's no tail pipe doesn't mean that nothing is being burned in the process of powering your vehicle.  Considering that [66.5%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._2013_Electricity_Generation_By_Type_crop.png) of energy in the US comes from burning fossil fuels, that is what will be powering your car.  Unless of course you're plugged into a solar array, then you're truly driving zero emissions.   It is known.   Jon's brother, ammarite?   That's not really what plot armor is.  Especially not having huge amounts of "power".  Certainly didn't save Robert or Joffery.  I think it's more related to having your character have some kind of story arc that needs completion.   According to the wiki: HBO announced Fortune as playing "Night's Watch Officer", but according to the actor and other sources this is the same role as Bowen Marsh in the books.  In the fourth season Fortune took over the role of Othell Yarwyck, which had been played by Dennis McKeever in the previous seasons. The reason for this sudden change has not yet been explained; or if the characters themselves have been merged.   plot twist: cloned GRRM grows up to be Christian Conservative who advocates burning fantasy novels due to pagan nature.   A Lannister always pays his debts... bitch!  Winter is coming... bitch!  The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword... yeah bitch!  I'm the mother of dragon!  Bitch.  A girl gives a man his own name? Bitch.  Your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth; bitch.  Make the bad man fly.. BITCH.  Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. (bitch.)   Oberyn probably wouldn't be Tyrion's champion if he were fighting Jamie.  He wanted the Mountain dead, not Jamie.      OK.. I'm actually only halfway through ADWD so I probably haven't got to that part quite yet.   Maisie Williams is actually 17 and only a few months younger than Sophie Turner (Sansa), so she's not quite a little girl.   I was slightly confused by Ramsay's treatment of the Iron Islander.  What I inferred from the books is that they were actually fed and given safety.  Did the show deviate from the books by killing them all?   Not necessarily true.  At this rate the show is set to pass the books in terms of story.  I know GRRM layed out very broad strokes of what is supposed to happen, but they are not waiting for him.  We are going to have two parallel universes that may only converge at the ending.   Great interview, thanks!   Came here for LITERALLY THIS!   wut the even fuck?   Well... to be far, he said he wears green to match his eyes, because green goes very well with blue!  Renly has quite the sense of color.   I know this might sound strange, that the solution to your problem might be another drug, but have you ever tried Ayahuasca?  I've heard of people spontaneously quiting cigs and other drugs after just using it once in a ceremonial setting.  Besides that, the most important thing is that you want to change.  At the end of the day, you have control over your own body and that is a very good thing.  Keep a journal of your progress and be proud of yourself when you manage to control yourself! You will get through this, because it's what you want and what you know you need.      Short answer: no. Waste of time.   Ha   It would be a lot easier to just pour the contents of one can into the other.   I just watched it last night! i get the reference! i get the reference!   I really doubt they will start doing flashbacks now.  They can just mention the prophecy in dialogue.   Yes, you're right. It's all about having fun.  Still, I want to get better.   Yeah of course, reddit. Downvote this. Can't have people you know, thinking critically about what they are eating, challenging the status quo and all that. *yawn*   [Highly relevant](http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/28/5661920/living-with-lag-oculus-rift-experiment-video)   I feel like it's training me to move quickly and impulsively instead of thinking deeply about a position.   My correspondence play rating: ~1800  My long play rating: ~1500  My blitz rating: ~1200  My bullet rating: ~950   I know speed chess is ruining my game, but I'm addicted to the rush!      What a stupid system that depends upon people breaking the law to enforce the law.   [This illustration](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Salladhor_Saan) in the wiki shows him as black, but I just searched the books and I don't think his skin color is ever mentioned.   Ah, yes, this definitely did not happen in the books, which is why I couldn't remember it.   What do you mean like Salladhor?  Wasn't he black in the books as well?   Why is Melisandre on there? When did she even meet her?   This one really was much better. The etching really helps bring out it's wolfiness.   Who's going to feed Robin his milkies now? He's a growing boy!   I can't get the brace to fit no matter what I do.  It seems like it's a few milimeters too long. Maybe the new alt is slightly different?  I'm thinking about taking off a little bit with a rotary tool.  What do you think?   Well. I've tried and tried and I cannot get the brace to go in.  If I put the front side in first, the back side doesn't fit, and vice versa.  I'm about to grind of a few milimeters from the end with a rotary tool.  Just want to make sure I'm not doing something stupid.   There's no audio system but this is an RV.  There are lights and things attached to the battery but I want to eventually move those to a second internal battery to be charged by solar panels.   Thanks. Do I have to attach the brace to the alt before I bolt it in or can I put the bolt through and then screw the brace on to the back of the Alt?   Ok, I had to cut off the connector on my old alt because it was melted into it and solder on a new one.  I have 3 issues left to finish this up!  1. I managed to get my shiny new alternator in, except for this piece (the 3rd image down).  It goes underneath the alt with the long bolt going through it and screws on to the back, I guess to give it more support.  This is probably a dumb question, but how important is this?  It was really hard to get it to go on properly.  2.  I think the belt is a little too loose because that gear below it does not spin when the belt is moving.  It seems almost impossible to get the belt tighter by swiveling the alternator.  Tips?  3. I also replaced the battery and when I went to connect it again there is this 3rd wire (that I'm holding in the picture).  I know this was connected to the negative terminal but I'm really not sure how.  Can I put it in with the other stranded wires? Oh yes, and it starts up fine without it connected, but I'm sure it should be.  OK, thanks for helping everyone.  Really looking forward to having this finished successfully.      When you want it NOW.   Kind of ruined it for me.  I found it much funnier when it was a couple of racist slurs interspersed with a bunch of random silly words.   I got the alt off and I'm working on those connections now.  [Picture](http://imgur.com/Lf1YPGm)  Which direction do I need to pull that plastic tab to remove it?  Towards the wires or up?   Ok. I was able to get all the bolts and belt off.  All that's left is to remove these electrical connectors.  This is the part I really don't want to screw up.  [Check out this pic](http://imgur.com/Lf1YPGm). As you can see there are two connectors. Which direction do I need to pull the one with the plastic tab? Thanks for your help!   OK I put the info above. I so wish I had a manual to follow..   [Follow up post here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/25hxr8/need_help_removing_an_alternator_see_comments_for/)   OK.. So, in a previous post you guys helped me get the shroud off to get to the alternator. Awesome.  Now I'm struggling to get the alternator itself out.  I know I need to take that belt off, and I know I need to remove at least one electrical connector.  I completely removed the bolt that seemed like it would allow it to swivel, but it still won't budge.  The second bolt I can see is actually blocked by the belt itself.  Should I just try to stretch the belt enough to get a wrench to that second bolt?  Will it then swivel so I can loosen and remove the belt?  How about the electrical connector?  I'm not sure how to remove it and I don't want to damage it.  Thanks everyone!  EDIT: This is a 1984 DIESEL Chevy G30      Thanks. I was able to get the shroud off! Woohoo. Now I can actually see the alternator.  Now I'm having trouble removing THAT of course.  I'll make another post...  FYI, I didn't have to remove anything, I just pushed the house hard enough that it got out of the way.   I need to remove the fan shroud to replace the alternator which has gone bad.  I unscrewed all the bolts from the fan shroud but I still can't get it out because of that thing in the way.  Any tips would be appreciated. Thanks!

 That belongs with Scott Walker's claim that since he handled the teacher protests at the Capitol he could handle ISIS.  The lowest common denominator mentality.   Thanks, Scott.        No, it's not mine.  Sorry.           Thanks again very much for these recommendations.  These works are completely unknown to me.  It's reassuring to know I'll never run out of operas to listen to.    Mozart's La clemenza di Tito is beautiful - especially the Act l buffa finale, which he engineered into one of his great scenes.     I don't think Walker has a chance at the nomination.  He's too stupid, vapid, ugly and undignified for national popularity at any meaningful level.  Not presidential material.  He does share a similar expression with W (that 'duh' look indicating profound stupidity) but he doesn't have W's wealthy upbringing to lend the illusion of class to his image.       Thanks very much for this link.  Yes, that's Truecrypt.  Here's what he said about his educational background:  "I have quite typical Soviet/Russian musical background, but I was lucky to study in Moscow in early 70s - - definitely the best place to be a piano student at that time.  Let me just mention some of the teachers: Lev Oborin, Yakov Flier, Yakov Zak, Yakov Milstein, Lev Naumov, Boris Zemlyansky, Dmitri Bashkirov, Eliso Virsaladze, Stanislav Neuhaus, Tatiana Nikolayeva  Not to mention great teachers at the Gnesin Institute  Alexander Ioheles, Maria Yudina, Maria Grinberg, Naum Starkman, Oleg Boshniakovich  Hope you can imagine the atmosphere! All these great musicians were completely accessible, i.e. their lessons were open to public.  The list of students wasnt too shabby either: Egorov, Pletnev, Pogorelich, Gavrilov, Igolinsky, Demidenko, Dang Thai Son, Postnikova, Shebanova and many more So, it was a pretty good background!"   The Soviet Union was a difficult place to make a career in music, to say the least.  It was a totalitarian state.   Read Maya Plisetskaya's or Galina Vishnevskaya's memoirs for some insight into the dangers and unbelievable obstacles artists endured in the soviet era.   I know some of these details from reading his comments and from a few brief exchanges with him.  He's so modest for such a talented and skilled artist.  The training was exceptional at the soviet conservatories.   I'll look forward to your post.  I am madly in love with Mozart, especially his operas, and would like to be more familiar with the musical context in which he matured.  Of Hasse, I only know his comment about young Mozart: "This boy will consign us to oblivion" or something like that.  Thanks very much for the recommendations.  I'll definitely check out the Pergolesi.  There was a beautiful old film made of La Serva Padrona with stunning Anna Moffo.  I saw it in chunks on YouTube, but it was missing the delightful finale.  	12
    Ibuprofen doesn't have acetaminophen in it   I don't know since I got them at a restaurant, but they looked like regular fries covered in minced garlic and serrano chilis, and toped with cayenne                   24x6x9.

 I don't if this is an acceptable comment in TIL, but thank you for the article. I've seen the movie, but this was a well-written piece that had a much different tone than the movie does. I've never considered the action myself, but living in the Bay area we all know someone who has.   What are you currently riding? I commute an hour give or take on a Bandit 1250, but I expect you'd be riding something way more badass, like one of the Kwakers from Mad Max, right?   I've personally seen it be either persons fault on this exact same path, numerous times. Lot's of heat between hikers and cyclists on that hill.   Ergo Sport. It's straps are bigger, for some reason (I thought sport models were more svelte..?) but that's the only one that worked for me and we sound like we share similar traits. If that doesn't work for you, I'm out of suggestions, but if you look into forward-facing, remember to get something that holds the baby's hips out, not something that let's their legs dangle straight down, that's how they end up with baby dysplasia. And don't worry too much about carriers for a bit anyway. They're light, and you'll want to hold them in your arms as much as possible anyway (since mothers are greedy and you won't get nearly as much holding time as you'd like.)   I've seen this done on the trail without the trail of ether. Much more dangerous than this guy safely seating the bead on a home mounted offroad tire.   Coming from Kansas City, I have to know, what is a BBQ Terrace?   That's just what the internet knows him for, but from what I've heard he's a pretty smart dude.     Or Jesus.   In the wiki article they note that it made a good laser target. Maybe that?   Thank you for the laugh.   This is what has me most concerned. I've been learning the MEAN stack because the company I work for would like us to produce a desktop-like app that will run in the browser to go alongside a scientific instrument that we produce and I thought Angular was the way to go from the reading I had done four-five months ago. It would be nice if someone could put me at ease that all of my learning and work isn't going to go out the window (or hasn't already) because the framework choice I've made is going to be outdated in another two or three months.   I've never skydived, so I'm speaking from complete ignorance. But how do you not notice that you're about to crash into the ground. For like, 10 seconds I kept waiting for the reserve to open because even I was thinking, 'Wow, all that stuff on the ground looks really big and clear.'   I don't know how to answer that. I have a wonderful wife and we've done remarkably well at having at least one of us stay positive at a time, mainly because the one not getting worn out can see when the other is wearing out and we just take over.  For a while my wife was working nights, and it was also when we were trying to sleep train my daughter. Those were hard, being alone, my daughter screaming bloody murder in the other room and me on my last nerve. I just got through it. So did she. When things get real bad just remember, it's okay to put them safely in a crib, close the door and take a break for ten or twenty minutes. Even when they're screaming their head off. Better you take a break than it get past that point of no return and something horrible happens. Plus, up until 2 or 3 years old they'll never remember the horrible, screaming filled nights that you left them alone until they figured out how to sleep and stay asleep. They don't remember much at that age actually.  I would never condone anyone ever hurting a child, never. I look at my babies and want to only protect them from the crap of the world. But I also could see how when you're tired, haven't slept more than a few hours a night for a couple weeks, and alone and they're screaming and it seems like it will never stop that lines get crossed. Remember to take a breath and that everything will be fine in the end. If it get's too hard, shoot me a PM.   Exceptionally bad all over. The freeways in the East and North bays (I commute from Fremont to Novato) we're all nasty. Everyone heading out of town, either to Tahoe, or north towards Napa/Sonoma.    Not just city traffic, 880, 80, 580, and 101 were all the same as this on the way home this afternoon.    I've never seen easy-peasy written like that. I'm totally stealing that.   Actually one in 7 billion would be 0.000000000143%   A heartbeat. That is the 100% factual amount of time it would take for me to pre-order this game.   Yeah, I sort of see your point. But, this guy was obviously making a move. And when you turned back the first time, I could clearly see the anger he was putting out there. He was obviously already peeved about something and no way were you going to slow him down.   This is the part I don't get, because I commute on a motorcycle and when I'm lane-sharing I always back down when I see cars and trucks making their move. They're going to put the metal out there, regardless of what I do. But all the videos I see of cyclists are the same thing, ride it out until the last possible moment and than do something about it while cussing the driver. I'll ride 40 mph between a two rows of stopped cars, but you cyclists, you got big balls.   Perfectly reasonable? How in the world does the cyclists reaction solve anything, at all? It doesn't and it is likely to cause more harm than good any way you look at it.  If someone cuts me off while I'm in my car, I don't reach out and slap their car, I honk my horn to alert them that they just pulled a bonehead maneuver. If someone cuts me off while I'm on my motorcycle, again, I keep my hands to myself, there are horns on these things for a reason. If someone cuts me off while riding my bike, I definitely keep my hands off of them. If they were willing to look directly at me and than try and kill me anyway, I definitely don't want to piss that guy off.   Don't get me wrong, I think the cyclist was completely in the right. The driver saw him, was either upset that he'd been stuck behind the cyclist for a few blocks, or is just a dick that wanted to get around him, and than pulled a completely ridiculous move and could have caused serious harm to the cyclist. But 'perfectly reasonable' is not the phrase I would use to define his reaction. Pissed-off, justifiable, brave. These are all words that I would use to describe this, but reasonable would never make that list.   There's humpback whales in the bay?   That was a Golden Gate Transit. I've sat next to that guy before. /s   We ran into Brad Pitt on a Duc in the Ozarks many years ago.    Ever been around children or toddlers? How'd she do? I have a big, fenced backyard, and a daughter who absolutely loves dogs, we're just missing the dog.   Poo explosion, leaking out of the diaper, on the couch. Get her naked, dunk her in the tub, shits in the tub. Get her out of the tub, rinse off with sprayer from the kitchen sink. Set her down for four seconds so you can wash the shit off your hands, shits on carpet. You know, lovable stuff like that. Actually, that stuff makes you just laugh once you get through it. The worse parts are the times when they're in pain, when they're sick, when there's nothing you can do except hold them and hope they feel better soon. It's the hopelessness that gets to me sometimes.   Parked in a handicapped spot without a tag in the middle of a snow and ice storm? Sounds like a reason to break their windows out. You showed much more restraint than I would've.   Not sure what he's talking about. Just bought thin mints, two rows of 18 cookies each.   My daughter went from crying as we dropped her off, to crying as we picked her up and left in slightly less than a week. Children quickly adapt, especially at that age, and especially once they realize how much fun it is.    Father of multiple children and another on the way. Don't worry about any of it. Do what comes naturally. Times will seem bad sometimes, than they will seem like they can't get any worse, than they will get worse. Then something magical will happen, like when my 16 month looked up at me at the end of dinner, and instead of just pushing all of her remaining food onto the ground, she clearly and concisely said for the first time ever, "All done," and you will instantly feel better about all of the bad times. And than she will push all of her remaining dinner onto the floor.   Thanks man, going to Home Depot tomorrow.   Is that a learning tower from somewhere, or did you make it yourself?   The Crow is generally thought of as a trickster in Native American storytelling. Sounds about right.   This is almost as cool as the dual-sport Ascot a buddy of mine rides up and down the passes in CO.  Naw, I'm just pulling your leg, this is awesome. Even without the turbo, it's still a well sorted ride.    Anyone know if you can turn off HUD in Titanfall or Dying Light?   You're talking about Ghost's and Goblins, right?   Throwback to the original, which I loved when I was a kid, so yeah, I dug it. Still play it when I'm bored.   Mine downloaded fine. Installed without a hitch. Also uninstalled just fine 30 minutes later.    We were always careful with her around stairs and held hands, made sure she realized what stairs were and where they were at. Plus she fell off the couch a few times once she started climbing up that so she knew what an 'edge' was and what happened if she fell off of it. So, we've found that when she approaches stairs, she holds her hand out to us and puts her other hand on the railing and only goes down when she's got ahold of both.   I do seriously miss those moments with my 16 month old. But, for our own sanity she had to start using the crib, it was getting ridiculous. I take guilty pleasure when she wakes up in the middle of the night screaming bloody terror and I get to rock her back to sleep in the glider.    I may be part of the minority, but when my daughter became mobile wh put in plug covers and locked one cabinet containing all the poison's. Other than that we gave her free roam of the house. She's now 16 months and has only had a few bumps and bruises and does just fine navigating the house with impunity. And if she wants to explore the skillet and pan cabinet, or pull all of the towels out of the closest, she can. She get's caught and has to help put them all back, which she does. It's worked for us, YMMV.   Don't know where you're at, but if you happen to live in Marin county, there's always [this](http://justplaygrounds.com/) next time. Could save you some driving around time and the whole getting out and than back into the carseat mess.   Dead brake light? Looks like this idiot never even touches his brakes. Maybe since it was a stolen bike he didn't know where they were...?   Leonard Part 6?   Are you kidding? I mean, I just told you.   When it's located within walking distance of our work, how unsafe is it for work?   Holy hell. I thought I had seen it all when I spent my first New Years hanging out in bar's in the Mission. But this, wow.   She also has no issue slandering other people if it get's her point across. Case in point, she has on her FB a picture calling out the father of the child with leukemia who spoke out against anti-vaxxers in Mill Valley a rep for Glaxo-Smith Kline, which is a complete fabrication.    Her public Facebook page reveals a lot about her stance on vaccination, slandering innocent people, and the Dr's that she chooses to associate with. This article, while it does explain that the media may have blown a passing comment out of proportion should in no way be used as evidence that this woman is not an anti-vaxxer or not a complete lunatic. Need more evidence, this idiot is the reason my 16 month old daughter was forced to remain quarantined in the house for two weeks while we waited to hear whether or not her children infected our entire playgroup.    You obviously don't read much past the article and believe whatever put in front of you. The "Dr's" who "advised" this woman are supporters of the [National Vaccine (mis)Information Center.](http://www.nvic.org/) Have a read, it's worth a laugh, until you realize that thousands of these people support this insanity. This woman is no advocate for those few people who medically should not receive vaccinations. She's a lunatic, spreading slander and crying wolf.   Funny, a quick glance at her public Facebook page shows how she does exactly the same thing to the father of the child with leukemia who spoke out against the anti-vaxxer crowd in Mill Valley. Please don't fall prey to the media's backpeddling, they may have blatantly misspoke about the measles parties, but this woman is no saint. Try reading more than the article, do a little research yourself. This woman supports the NVIC (National Vaccine Information Center) a not-so subtle cover of a group that's out promoting the anti-vaccination party line. The "Dr's" that are "advising" her to not have her children vaccinated are Dr's like [Dr. Joseph Mercola](http://vaccines.mercola.com/).  People like this woman are not the victims that they would have you believe. They are the problem.   Yes yes yes. Coincidentally, this same poor woman who's entire family is struck down with this rare disorder that medically prevents them from getting vaccinated is also out spreading mis-information about the father of the child with leukemia who petitioned the Mill Valley School Board to get unvaccinated kids out of school in an attempt to defame him. Funny how a woman that speaks out about media skewing the truth has no problem jumping aboard any slander campaign that comes along, especially if it makes her look slightly less crazy.   Do a little research on the subject of the article for a change. This lady is as Marin as they come, and I don't mean that in a nice way. Her, and her nurse friend had my 1 year-olds entire playgroup locked up in quarantine for a week while we waited to find out if those retarded assholes had infected us all.   She is as anti-vaccine, anti-school, and anti-establishment as they come. I weep for her children knowing that they'll both likely grow up to be as fucked in the head as she is.   I read this in Dr. Emmett Brown's voice from Back to the Future.   I thought it was one of those find the difference pictures that my daughter plays with.   I miss my wee-strom with TKC's.   This is the stuff nightmares are made of.    Different rear tires, different license plates, one on the left is rocking the twin solid front rotor while the other one doesn't seem to have a front brake. Can confirm, different bikes.   Don't know why you're getting downvoted. I agree 100%. It's not worth $40, that's for sure. I'll wait till the price drops.    I suspect you are looking for Mr. Lincoln, not Ford.   Any other Dad gamers out there?   I play Titanfall, BF4, Sniper, Dying Light.  GT:GOATRper   No problem, wanted to tell you before the less nice people came along.

I think you should consider reviewing the Advertising, Self-Promotion, and Spam section of this subs [guidelines.](http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/wiki/index)   That looked like an amazing sportsing. The guy with the stick sportsed the ball good, but the guy catching the ball was obviously sportsing much harder. Good job my new favorite sportsers because you're winning.   I like it, found some new track to listen to, and an artist I'd never heard of. Thanks.   Also, do you have a source for the movie that the gunship animation was from?   Does anyone else feel queasy and kind of ready to throw up a little when you watch someone this drunk?   I've never played any of the Just Cause series games, or any games from Avalanche Studios. From the response here and in /r/gaming I'm assuming this is a studio we can trust?   It's not a show it's Digiorno   Plus, no xbox in sight anywhere.   It feels unnatural, I'll give you that. But it can be done, I won't ever swap the bars on my Bandit for clip-ons, it's just too nice on long trips, but when hitting the twisties, they're not a determent, it just takes some getting used to.   Sense is coming to Marin. So nice to see that things have gotten to where we need to parade sick kids around before people listen to sense.   Don't get me wrong, I'm fully in support of doing it if that's what it takes, just sad that that's really what it takes.   Yep, that's what the fast guys would always lecture me about.   We always called them gutter punks. Or am I thinking of something different? The ones in KC always had a pit bull with them. In fact, I once met a minivan full of them that were traveling from LA to Boston in this shitty Astro-van and their dog had puppies the day before. In the van. That was what hammered home to me that it was a lifestyle I would never want. I'm glad these pictures came out and reinforced my decision.   I was going to leave early for work to get a little stuff done before the rest of the team showed up and slowed me down. Instead I am going to wait for my 16-month old daughter to wake up and hug her.   Move your head to the inside. Imagine your head being where your mirror is.

Self, you're such an idiot sometimes.   That ship's not over 1,000 feet long. Each one of those cargo containers is 40 feet long and I count 20 rows, so 800 feet in containers, plus a little bit on each end. That plus the crew area near the middle, it's maybe 850-900 feet long, but not over 1,000.   Rickrolls don't work when I have to watch a commercial first.    Wow, never saw this reply, sorry.   You can stay in the state machine architecture and decouple your UI from your code. Storing your relevant variables in FGV's is one way, however, storing it in the private data of an object is even better. Start looking for ways that you can build objects in your code and use them store relevant variables, settings, etc... in the object.   The actor framework is cool because it is a state machine. It's just built into an object and a little hidden. But's it's still a state machine. So, if you have a process in those while loops that fits a state machine architecture, than it's already an actor, you just need to build an API for it and go.   That's your problem. System fonts. The scourge of designers everywhere. What is a system font on your computer is different on another computer and likely even different on your own computer in and out of the development environment. It's because the system font goes and asks Windows what to use for a font and sizing. Windows gives back the font that's been selected, along with the size that being used. Don't use system font. Specify a font, like Ariel, etc... Choose something that's system agnostic and you'll never have problems again, regardless of your .ini settings.   There's still a DASYLab forum at NI.com, [here](http://forums.ni.com/t5/DASYLab/bd-p/50)  Not sure if you knew, but NI bought up DASYLab a few years ago.     Great, glad I could help.   But then they go black and never go back.    Yep, that was it. I guess this is a better explanation than he was being a dick.   I'm not quite sure I follow what you're attempting to do, but to answer the question here. The easiest and most straightforward way to read/write a cluster from/to file is to use the MGI add-on "Read/Write Anything" which you can find in VIPM. This gives you a human readable .ini file format. Although, I myself prefer JSON or XML, but that's not the question here.  Back to the topic though. Let me re-state the problem to see if I understand. Your team's robot has a number of values stored in an .ini file. You need to read these values from the file on startup and than use those values in approximately 45 places all over the code. Is that the gist of it?   I've seen this a number of times now since moving to the bay area four years ago. CHP officer way our in front of traffic, going about 25 or 30 miles an hour and weaving across all lanes, I saw one this morning heading northbound on 880 while I was heading southbound. I figured they did it to slow traffic because of an accident up ahead, however, this morning, I hadn't seen any accident north of where I saw the officer weaving.   Any other reason they would do this?   I think what you're looking for is [this.](http://labviewwiki.org/Functional_global_variable)  Use a functional global holding a cluster of your .ini values. Read from the functional global where you need to. You can even replace the Set case with an Init case that does the reading from the file so you don't inadvertently overwrite your values. Let me know if this doesn't make sense and I'll throw together a quick VI showing what I'm talking about.   I was scared to click on the Aphex Twin, knowing them. Regretted it instantly.   Something it also has in common with my house.   Yes, because this was a 'little' mistake.   He almost collided head on with another vehicle while speeding, making an unsafe and unlawful pass, than ran up an embankment and took the cheapest flying lessons they offer.   Sure, that was a little mistake.    Wear a respirator or sell cars?  Edit: Awesome picture by the way. She's beautiful and we can all see how much you love her.   The reactionary side of me thinks that people who choose to exercise their personal belief exclusion should be exposed on some public list, similar to those that are on the sex offender registry. They have chosen to endanger society with their beliefs and the rest of us should be made aware of who and where these people are.   The realist in me knows how 1984 (the book, not they year) this kind of thinking is and just wishes that group of individuals would instead choose to put more effort into revealing all the facts to themselves about vaccinations rather than just the ones that support their own belief system.   Holy shit that guy is annoying as fuck.   Tony Scott definitely had his moments. I've got a daughter now and recently lost my dad, so the cheesy stuff probably hits me a little harder now than it used to, but the emotional ride of this movie gets me right in the feels. And getting to watch, what I consider, one of the better revenge-films killing sprees in the genre, is always fun. The cast is sometimes painful to watch, let's be honest, Marc Anthony's acting chops are no better than his music chops, but despite the rough patches this movie still delivers for me.   Don't be sorry. Be proud. Someone's opinion has to be at the bottom.   Sysops. Blech.   /s  I'm just kidding, I love you guys, so long as my interwebs is working and I don't catch grief because I decided to turn off every last vestige of a firewall on my business laptop.   If their phones were working, why not, you know, call their friends?   I understood all that perfectly. I must have learned German sometime.   Ah, alright Novato, we don't put up with that nonsense.   Edit: A word.   I'm not quite sure how to read this, but we either don't accept that kind of mess in Novato or we're some of the worst offenders.   The news report I saw said the students had placed a Palestinian flag out. Doesn't seem like our typical, race war against cops protest.   This, 100%. Why not just let that film end the way it should have. [Spoiler](#s "Did Jamie Foxx have some clause that he wouldn't do it if they killed him off?")   This is actually how I understood math when I was learning it in grade school, and that was way before the Make 10 strategy existed. I just thought it was easier to get to the round base 10 number and go from there.   Thank you for this. Back in 2007 I spent some time in Belgium and Holland and was introduced to a lot of French rappers and hip-hop artists. When I came back to the U.S. finding their material was pretty tough and I quickly forgot about them. This video reminded me of how much I dig listening to French rap, despite not knowing a single word of French.   You've done a lot of things right with your code from a cleanliness perspective, and it would be easy to hand this code off to someone else and they could probably figure out what is doing what with minimal effort.   However, from an architecture standpoint, there's a lot that could be done to improve efficiency, re-use, and test-ability. Currently, you can't test any of the loops independent of one another, so your functions are tightly coupled to one another. It also seems like all of your loops are tightly coupled to front panel controls. So changing something on the front panel intrinsically means changing something in one of your loops.   A perhaps better design might be to implement each of those loops as a standalone 'module' that may use data passed into it from the front panel controller, but isn't reliant on it. Than you can simulate the data into each module so you can unit test the module without having to have a front panel or camera or whatever. Than, each time your engineering team decides to change something you can implement the changes internally, unit test, than deploy it without having to take down the test system.   Also, if you ever change hardware, as long as your API of your module never changes your top-level system code never needs to change. You just build a new module, drop it into place.   You are at a great place to begin considering expanding your LabVIEW toolbox. Start looking into to how classes work. Maybe begin exploring how some OOP frameworks are implemented like the Actor Framework. Like I said at the top, this is good, and it works, which makes it even better. But, it's complicated, and tightly coupled everywhere. You've built a very nice looking house of cards, but unfortunately it's still a house of cards. It's time to begin to explore how to build a strong foundation for your house, and how to make it's rooms more modular so you can remove or change one without the whole thing coming down.   Thank you so much, because now I know, that out there in this crazy mixed up world, there are people just like me. People who can never again see or hear the term, "No ragrets," without seeing it or hearing it like that.   [There's always this version of it](http://youtu.be/LArygQ6I7Vc?t=1m27s)   A lot of times they ride to those parking lots without license plates doing stand-ups while going down the highway at 70+ mph.

 We did! He signed it "all my love" and his signature :)   It was for the premier of his new movie Suburban Gothic. He encouraged everyone to come in their pajamas.       The Mcpoyles go clubbing    Driving in San Francisco is HORRIBLE! There are one way streets everywhere. If you miss your turn or your entrance to the grocery store, you have to go up two more blocks, turn left, get on the highway, merge to a different Highway, take the exit, and left turn, just to get to the turn that was 3 feet behind you. Not to mention... It's all uphill   	5

 I have an alter-ego named "Kyle." Kyle is a smarmy, sarcastic, charming, manipulative, asshole, but the kind that everyone wants to have sex with.   I am a girl, and my name is definitely not "Kyle."   I do this sober. I never thought to do it drunk, but I bet a boiled egg makes a great drunk snack.   I live my life by the fuck you, I do what I want. I'm a 30 year old woman, sitting in my bed, which is covered with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sheets, in my room, which is covered floor to ceiling in posters for everything I love which includes -  80's slasher movies,  Kpop boy bands,  Professional wrestling,  video games,  super heroes and giant robots-  I AM A GODDAMN ADULT I PAY MY BILLS AND SHIT I CAN LIKE WHAT I WANT   Raw is waaaay more fun to go to, and worth the money IMO. It's a very fun experience.   I'm a 30 year old woman and I do this as well. My girlfriend, My best friend and I will sit in my room, drink, and watch the WWE network until 3am with no regrets.  	5
 is no one going to mention that pile of scallops?    At least he's trying to make some deep convo too    cute... cat   Same in Belgium. They don't have to wear it while driving passengers (so that they can get out fast if someone tries to do a runner?)   Wow, you should definitely complain because that's a disgusting way to treat a person. Being completely honest, probably nothing will happen. I think you should complain for your own peace of mind and in the hopes it ends up in some sort of record. If you can give enough detail, maybe the asshole in question will get a slap on the wrist. I'm sure you're not the only person that ran away from a controller. The stib controllers are there to check your ticket, not critique your life.   *chants*  Quit! Quit! Quit!    -I'd say most people on here are from Flanders  - I think you could be right about that. I think Walloons tend to be more into French culture, they have a bigger market that Dutch speaking areas so we have to turn to English media  - I have honestly no idea!   - I'd say it goes for the whole country. We tend to see ourselves as two different people but when someone from the outside turns on us, suddenly we're all Belgians.   - Being totally honest, yes. I personally think it's not done to eat with only your fork if you have company and I think a lot of people will agree.  - I agree with all of those, but I always like giving tourists Duvel for the hell of it. They think it's like lager while it's twice as strong at least!   I especially enjoyed Wouter Beke's posthumous stab at Stevaert's politics in the last decade. Exellent way of sharing your condolences.    endive gratin is the best thing in the world (even better when a grandmother makes it)   just bring toilet seat covers. Jeez.   Dude if you think it's a worm, post it in r/worm or something. I'm out here looking what I wanna cook for dinner tomorrow, and it's NOT WORMS   Then i wasn't the only one who noticed! It worries me because a lot of young people party over there (including me). It would make sense if it's a gang of some sort. I mean, a couple of people can easily toss a drunk teen/young person into icy water without any further damage.    Hodei, the exchange student that still hasn't been found was last seen in that neighborhood. They found another student named Germain in a different dock. There was also a portuguese man was found in yet another dock. I believe a couple of months ago they found another body that they couldn't identify. Don't know if this is a common thing in areas with docks but it just sprang to my attention that there have been a lot of people going missing and being found around there.   It's a little worrying how a handful of perfectly healthy young men have disappeared in that part of the city in the past few months and then turn up dead without any signs of violence (or don't turn up at all)   This kind of thing is probably what got the village fool castrated in the olden days   holy dad   You look amazing! That dress is very flattering on you as well   If someone you know has a penis (ANY penis) that looks like that, please send them to a doctor   I have a cookbook from roald dahl too and made lollipops on the back of pens a while back... Best purchase ever. Will try this sometime soon!!   I believe this was at tomorrowland. You could bump your head to the bass from a city away.  	20
 Some subscribers would be nice   I was joking...    If your mom was here and she heard you tell that joke...  You'd get an ear full for sure   Oak Park or Del paso   .... Or he have a max signing in place..  There are lot of free agents that we can make bids for.    Wait what?    Plastic Ono is better   Yea...  That's softball.    Dirty paws is a very likeable song by most.     I was worried about this...  Weekend fling went to long.       Right...?  Doesn't make sense   It happens alot   BORNS is sick.  It's actually only him.    Good job!    I almost edited my response.  I think that's what took from the album.  The classic commercializing of the band happened.  They made the sex appeal the lead and raggi sits back when he was just as important.  Watch the hood morning America video that someone posted...  He just looks different. It's sad.    That motherfucker   This guy teaches us how to cut wood...  Now he teaches us to cut onions!   He turned into a lion at the end...    That three was it for me...  Dova can fuck my girl    Yea im seeing them at city of trees festival.    Crystals - mainstream hit. Pleasant yet different.   Human -  nice lyrics and a little upbeat.   Hunger -  Same as human.  Definitely a little more of a tune.   Wolves with teeth -  Honestly I feel this is my favorite song.  A nice different vibe.  Good song to throw off the vibe of the other songs.   Empire -  great lyrics and nice upbeat tune.   Slow Life -  I feel most are gonna let this slip through the cracks.  It honestly is a gem of a song.  A little slower but lyrically great  Organs -  probably the next hit.  Lyrically sublime where I feel instrumentality,  the band reached the deepest.  Integration of the cello was just a treat.   Black water -  kinda takes me back to MHIAA.   Thousand Eyes -  Slow start up but a great entry into eye of the storm.  Cool drum sequence that actually is pretty intense.   I of the storm -  My favorite single.  This song is lyrically deep and actually quite similar IMO to crystals. Awesome song.   We sink - One of the more fun songs on the album.   In all the album is everything I anticipated.  I saw them Saturday so that made this all the more worth it. I feel like they artistically didn't venture out like I wished but lyrically I feel it was deeper.  The songs are quote repetitive in sound but each demands it's own identity. Another great album by an amazing band.    Introduce a little anarchy   Dude this bitch is fucking ugly   Open some pussy.  Fuck your cake day    Fuck your cake day   I really honestly love every song.  Wolves without teeth is fun!  Slow life is just as good as any. Thousand eyes is intense and is an amazing build up. Organs is sick as any hit.  Same with humans.   Only issue is that lot of songs sound repetitive. But that's like being fed cake over and over again. Kind of a good problem to have!  My favorite right now is probably wolves.    Fuck your cake day.    Shot fired!!    Loaded question!  Don't answer!!    I'm guessing it's loading   If the Chinese put it on there...  I believe there's a fucking reason.    Don't tell me what to do with my toggles.    Bro...  WTF...  First off,  this reeks scam.    2nd .. You live in a world where you can literally put yourself out there.  Fuck this. My rule is if you have to pay to benefit them...  Scam.    If she is single...  And anyone here has a chance...  There is no way in hell I'd let any of you get her before I did.  Truth.    So yea..  Fuck this guy   Let us know what you think!    Are you sure you're a condom and not a dick? Because you're supposed to wrap your tool...  Not be a tool..    NO SPEAKING FUCKING SPUDNIK AT THE TABLE!    Do you know a guy named worm?    Really?  I liked the apple showing with Drake.  It was the best they ever had.    31 people found it funny.  I brought joy to someone.  Fuck off and find something better to do. Go smoke some swag.    :( I hope you find it.    You're hella funny...  I'm trolling buddy   Thick means a girl who has ass and thighs...  Haven't you ever heard a rap song.    Huh   White trash mud wrestling... I still don't see a problem.    BONUS: This is probably the cleanest their hair has ever been. So good it's almost orgasmic.   They were supposed to be the 8th lol all good tho   It's funny...  By most standards... She's a very basic average girl.  I have heard some say ugly.     For whatever reason,  I think she is so ridiculously cute.  Her voice and accent just make her adorable.    I don't understand what's bad about this video...   -Both women will be arrested and will better society by being gone.    -The kid will hopefully be put in a better home and given a chance to succeed.   -Two less people in line at Walmart.  BONUS: One less fat lazy person stealing a scooter from an elderly person  -visual entertainment during a boring Monday.   These rednecks should be given an award IMO.

Also making him more susceptible to physical ailments and injuries   I would definitely give admissions a call.  Reddit is not the only source of info.  I would call and find out.  Good luck!  I would put my money on that we will see you in the fall.    You must have accepted SIR before due date..  Idk who was advising you in your colleges but I accepted on SIR and eventually rescinded once I chose UCSC.  There is no consequence for accepting SIR and then deciding otherwise other than SIR fee.   Even if you did accept SIR,  you will not meet their requirements either as all UC and CSU require good standings with institution and [C minimum in all classes attended in spring 2015.](http://admissions.ucsc.edu/apply/conditions-faq.html)    I would definitely begin CC application as a precaution. Contract states no D's but you may be able to try and appeal.  Good luck.    Idk why these keep getting posted..  Just search for the same question.    You were already admitted.  They gave you a contract that states as long as you don't get/do "X"  you will be attending in the fall. Your GPA already got you in.  Unless it states anywhere in your contract of a GPA requirement (which to my knowledge it doesnt)  you are fine.  Contract states that you must attain at least C's on your final classes. Sounds like you did that.    Khan has a glass chin and is only been used for money purposes for the British population.  Any person who says either stands a chance is foolish.  I'd rather get my bang for my buck and have a HOF fighter who gave him his best run fight rather than a guy who just has popular support.    Thank you!    I actually like bud light...    Lol no...

But do you guys remember Mayweather Vs Ortiz 24/7?  This guy is super emotional and I feel mentally unstable.  Nobody considers him relevant.  All he is is a roadblock to bigger fights.  I honestly felt that him and DE LA Hoya had a fling or something. They were just odd together and this doesn't stretch that.  They could have both been coked out since de la hoya went to rehab.    This is all speculation and opinion.    What?  I'm sure they just gave him some craft bud til he was floating on air.    Even for a superstar,  those are some extreme minutes.  Do you think Lebron is going to fatigue?       Fuck off   The irony is ridiculous.    Stop crying,  they took off an upvote.    Sounds like they may be making teams potentially waste a pick so lower teams can possibly get someone better.  Good strategy.     Eventually I got in and it said it wasn't available yet...

Please see them in person.    DON'T TELL PEOPLES WTF BERNICE NEEDS!    I'm not saying it is...  Merely stating that it kinda reminds me of it.. I'm speaking of right now in Sacramento.

Nanna is gorgeous and their style was slick.  I heard crystals and thought WTF...  They sold out.  I was pissed off. Listened to it a few times and it grew on me. As did every single they put out (except I of the storm.  I loved that immediatly) They are growing and they changed. For the better.  Nanna and Raggie said this was a chance to open up.  *this* is the real OMAM.  I love it. Keep listening and you will too.    This band really sets the bar high for artists...  Their show was incredible. They made the audience be involved which was sick.  The bands chemistry is incredible. They all rotated to the front and lead at least once. Played every song you wanted to hear and even played the whole band on one guitar deal.  It was sick.  I've been to a ton of festivals including cali roots a few weeks ago...  This had been the best concert yet. Go if you haven't..!    I blame it on th e shitty tswift    I'm so excited for this album   Sick!  I see them Saturday at BFD      This!

I couldn't believe that it happened again.  My stuffed bear was touching my penis again. Mr. Jones was a beige colored stuffed bear with a missing button eye. Oh how he was a friend of mine.  We used to do everything together.  Fish,  hike,  sleep.  Man we were inseparable.  Then as we got older,  Mr. Jones became to close.  He would whisper obscenities in my ear as I slept like "Leonardo will never get an Oscar." or "Just do it!  Yesterday you say tomorrow,  so just.....  DO IT!". One time I woke up and I saw Mr.  Jones playing with himself watching me as I slept.  Sure I was wearing some nice,  comfortable, elastic less,  tag-less Hanes underwear with a logo of Space Jam on it. Mr.  Jones whispered under his breath.... "what's up doc". Mr. Jones copulated with me that night. As he pulled down my Hanes underwear that you can find at any target store for about $7.99 for a pack of 3, I realized that I had the slightest erection. It wasn't extremely high like you get when wearing a pair of Jordan high top sneakers, which you can find for appx. $100 at your local shoe store. No,  this erection let me know that I was ready to jam my piece into Mr. Jones. I slept that night. I awoke a new man.  Rejuvenated!  Alive!  Revived like a man who was worn down but had a fresh glass of Gatorade, which is a high performance energy drink engineered to allow you to perform at you peak ability which you can buy at any store for $3.00.

 I'm not a historian, but the movie "Destination Moon" might allude to an answer to your question.  The movie deals with the challenges of conducting a manned expedition to moon.  At one point early on in the film, religious objections to space travel are brought up, only to be summarily dismissed by the protagonists.  The scene seemed so obviously didactic, and out of place to my modern sensibilities that it seemed like the film makers were making an earnest attempt to address something that must have been part of the cultural debate at the time.  I watched the movie probably ten years ago, and that scene still sticks with me today because it came across as so utterly weird.   Brilliant       It's a bit premature to claim that there's a market for them when the are none for sale.   That said, I suspect that there's ultimately a niche market of gun and technology dweebs who would buy them, as well as ignorant people who think a smart gun means they don't need to bother with a safe out other form of physical access control.       I've seen comment sections at NPR where people have voiced their admiration for North Korea having a small carbon footprint.      Nope.      No, its not true at all.    The lady doth protest too much, methinks.          You can't possibly believe all if the stupid things you post.    My money would be on The Grinch Who Stole Christmas.    Here's a link to the policy fine print (pdf)  http://www.locktonrisk.com/nrains/forms/ArmsCare_Coverage_Form.pdf  While there is a clause that says they don't cover guns that are illegal, I doubt very much that they would refuse to cover the loss of your perfectly legal AR just because it's illegal in California.   FWIW, a friend of mine had a pistol stolen that is likely illegal somewhere in this country, and he received a payout for it.          Just the one BS.   But I'm also house broken.    I'm now being called insane by the guy who thinks cops should be forced to face dangerous criminals alone and unarmed.     Much hilarity.   Such irony.   Wow.    Goddamn, you're just too adorable for your own good.  Tell you what.  Why don't you go down to the local PD and float that idea and see how far it gets you.   My bad, I figured it wouldn't be an issue since I was linking to another sub-reddit friendly to gun rights.  I do 99% of my posting from mobile, so the screen shot method is a hassle to pull off.  I'll just refrain from linking to other subreddits from now on.   This really is a perfect example of just how thoroughly irrational and incessantly self-entitled the anti-gun mindset is.   It strikes me that the User is tilting at windmills, but does reveal a certain level of bias on the part of the Reddit admin staff.      That didn't take long.   Muh roads!   /obligatory    Then what specific policy recommendations do you have?    So in the situation as presented, how do your talking points apply?    You hiring?    And of course, instead of advocating for better self defense training, your solution is to deny a woman the the ability to make choices about her own self defense.   Fucking sexist.    In the case of this commercial, would you care to explain why you think the woman is still cohabitating with the man she has a restraining order against?          Costs more than you make in a month.   It's mentioned for context to establish that he is dangerous and a prohibited person. Think of it as ticking off one of the check boxes for "establishing the villain."  Also one of the things that Bloomberg's group seeks to do is to tighten the restrictions on men who've had a restraining order issued against them, and I think they are also playing on the intended audience's ignorance regarding the fact that such laws already exist.   Ha! Thanks.   It's interesting to note that regardless of the fear mongering over the Beretta and other double stack wonder nines, the one study the ATF did on the subject in 2000 didn't show a single such gun on the list of mossy popular crime guns.   https://www.atf.gov/sites/default/files/assets/pdf-files/ycgii-report-2000-highlights.pdf   To be clear, this guy is a jackass who's looking to get a fat payout from the state by trying to get them to over react in such a way that he can sue them.   I don't want Jenny McCarthy on my side.   It did that automatically.   I'm sorry,ididn't mean to offend you and baby Jesus.          They'll probably post one later today. They're usually pretty good about that.    Agree completely.   The history of malfeasance arising from the recording of gun ownership data is far too large to engender any level of trust in anyone who wants to record that data.       Ah. No worries. I do most of my posting from mobile, so doing the screen-grab and rehost process is kind of onerous.   I'll just refrain from linking to other subreddits.          Ah. I used the np link. Figured that would be adequate. Sorry.          Do you have a source for this claim?      One of the most hilarious anti tactics is where they will glom onto some piece of marketing material from a gun company, and then proceed to take it 100% literally and act like whatever had gotten them so upset is the most deadly development in weaponry since the days of the Trinity tests.   There really should be a name for that tactic.    Too bad, as I'm sure most leftists would have rushed to his defense for taking a stand on abortion.    Why?  There's only about four active members there.    I post this not because of the article, but because of the epic amounts of anti butthurt in the comments.       ITT:  Overly-infantilized European pussies demonstrating that we really did make the right choice in revolting against them in 1775.   /'Merica   The way I see it, there are two options:  1.) They grossly over-inflated the number of transfers made per year in order to justify their idiotic law and to get funding for a bloated new bureaucracy.  or  2.) People are just completely disobeying the law. Those who are selling guns to known prohibited persons don't care about the law, and everyone else simply doesn't feel like dealing with the inconvenience of hunting down an FFL to transfer a gun to a friend who they know has a clean background.  In either case, it's a fairly damning indictment. The Dems who pushed for this law have egg all over their face.   Boy, the Democrats sure Munsoned this one up.   That's pretty damning.    The fact that he wants the NHS to waste money on this garbage is terrifying.    At the state level, Hickenlooper and other Dems have voiced support for energy exploration and the use of fracking.  Regarding the road issue, I don't see how the topic is controversial, though I'm certainly not a subject matter expert on the matter.   Agree.  Requests for evidence demonstrating the efficacy of the laws passed last year are invariably met with down votes and name calling.   http://m.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/07/22/shaneen-allen-race-and-gun-control/  As it turns out, Allens case isnt unusual at all. Although white people occasionally do become the victims of overly broad gun laws (for example, see the outrageous prosecution of Brian Aitken, also in New Jersey), the typical person arrested for gun crimes is more likely to have the complexion of Shaneen Allen than, say, Sarah Palin.   **Last year, 47.3 percent of those convicted for federal gun crimes were black  a racial disparity larger than any other class of federal crimes, including drug crimes.** *In a 2011 report on mandatory minimum sentencing for gun crimes, the U.S. Sentencing Commission found that blacks were far more likely to be charged and convicted of federal gun crimes that carry mandatory minimum sentences.*  What was that you were saying about talking points, now?      If you shoot .45 with any amount of regularity, you'll end up spending far more on ammo in the long run.   Buy a quality gun, like a used Glock. Long term, the extra couple hundred bucks won't matter and you'll end up with a much better gun.   If you are so strapped for cash that a decent gun is out off the question, then you should reconsider buying a gun chambered for one of the more expensive cartridges available.    So two examples on essentially uncontroversial topics out of a grand total of how many proposed bills?    I fail to see how staying the undeniable fact that gun control is historically rooted in racism is bull shit.   Consider the following:  https://www.firearmsandliberty.com/cramer.racism.html  http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/10/09/adam-winkler-gun-fight-author-on-gun-control-s-racism.html (apologist article favoring gun control, but the author acknowledges the historical connection.)  http://www.npr.org/2014/06/05/319072156/guns-kept-people-alive-during-the-civil-rights-movement   Sticking it to lawful gun owners was the plan all along, but remember, the media has to pretend otherwise lest they run the risk of appearing unimpartial.    I'm glad that the law doesn't affect how you choose to defend yourself, but do you honestly believe that choice should be restricted by the state for others who've come to a different conclusion?   Not so, given that the historical record of gun control is one rooted in the oppression of minorities, most specifically African Americans.  After all, the history of American gun control is irrefutably rooted in the era of the racist antebellum south.  As for these laws being unenforceable, then the laws should be outright repealed.  After all, just because the law is unlikely to result in a conviction doesn't mean the law can't be used against someone to make their life a living hell (having to deal with being arrested, tried, fined and/or imprisoned until the court date, to say nothing of the fact that anyone charged would have to retain a lawyer, miss work, and deal with the stress of being dragged through the legal system.)  Even if there isn't an attempt to maliciously prosecute someone by charging them with a violation that's unlikely to stick in court, there's also the general chilling effect that it has on the average lawful citizen's rights to own and use firearms for self-defense, recreation, and other moral and legal applications.  If you acknowledge the laws serves no purpose, then you should support repealing them.   If the effect of the law results in disproportionate prosecutions and use of violence against minorities by the legal system, or enables racist law enforcement officers to unfairly victimize minorities, does it really matter whether or not the original proponents of the law are outright racists?   Not only are the cops not enforcing these laws, most of the state's sheriffs are signed onto the lawsuit to repeal the laws.   The history of gun control is one founded in the racism of the Jim Crow-era deep south, and even today, gun control laws are disproportionately used to prosecute minorities.   Well, the fact that the law isn't enforceable is probably the prime reason for why it should be repealed.  In fact, even people who aren't into gun rights (or who actually do support gun control) should call for the law to be repealed because it's such an unenforceable, poorly-written mess.  Frankly, if anything, gun control advocates should be *more* vocal about repealing the magazine ban, because the longer it's on the books, the more stupid they look.   How often has he worked to compromise with the Republicans in the Senate?   Magazine repair kits aren't technically legal per the law.  If you assemble the parts into a magazine that you didn't own before the cutoff date in the law, that's a violation punishable by a year in prison or a $1,000 fine.            One of the republican party's biggest weaknesses is that they just won't shut the fuck up about social issues like abortion, gay marriage, or weed.   The days of Focus on the Family and Ted Haggard being able to swing elections are over, but the state party hasn't figured that out.          "Hate fact" that's hilarious.    I think it's cute that of the entire list of evidence I provided, the only thing you can actually respond to (and poorly at that) is that the photos were somehow faked "out in a dessert (sic)."  I guess I shouldn't belittle you, though. After all, you're just the product of a failed education system that couldn't even be bothered to teach you the basics of critical thinking or self-directed learning.   What's also hilarious and sad is that this person wants to be spoon fed the answer, rather than going out and doing some research and reading up on the topic.   You mean no evidence beside the multitude of nations that tracked the spacecraft travel to and from the moon, the photos taken there, the samples of lunar regolith that were brought back, and the equipment that we left on the surface that can still be seen and used for scientific experimentation, right?            http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/2b9e9k/emsk_how_a_gun_works/cj3dh1p.compact   The left claims that gun ownership is shrinking, but that doesn't seem to square up with the fact that there are record numbers of people taking introductory safety classes and getting their carry permits.   Also, if gun owners are a dying breed, then why does it seem like new shooting ranges are being constructed at record pace?    So he supports idiotic gun control policies and then gets all butthurt when gun owners call him out on his duplicitous actions.   What a complete and total putz.    This is the best point of the entire article.   Gun control isn't about crime or violence, it's about scoring points in the culture war.   The sooner everyone realizes that the movers and shakers of the gun control movement aren't just misguided our mistaken, actively trying to infringe on a civil right just to assuage their own egos, the better of we'll all be.    It's possible for the number of gun owners to be at record highs, but their percentage of part of the overall population to remain the same or even go down.   If the growth in population outpaces the growth of the population that owns guns, then it gives the appearance of dwindling gun ownership rates even though the number of new gun owners is at an all-time high.    Dan Baum lives in Colorado.   He did not testify at the Senate hearings our even show up to watch.   He did not contribute to the recall campaigns after his beloved democrats passed poorly written laws authored by Michael Bloomberg's lawyers.   He isn't interested in gun rights, he's just a typical leftist who has glommed onto guns so he can sound edgy when he's attending dinner parties with his undoubtedly pallid-skinned leftist friends.    Congratulation on finding a single example of a statistical anomaly on par with being attacked by a shark or struck by lightning.   I'll never fly on a rocket to low-earth orbit.  Doesn't mean I don't find it interesting.      6) Pulse Rifles    No, they fully understand this, they simply don't care.   The motivation for gun control has nothing to do with violent crime*, and everything to do with scoring points by sticking it to a constituency that progressives reflexively hate.   *in fact, from a culture war perspective, gun control that actually effectively reduced violent crime would be a failure, as it would then be an impediment to instituting further restrictions.    Pursuit Channel is just a live stream of their content.   They do outdoorsy type shows.    Every man should be willing to take an interest, even if it's something as basic as spending 30 seconds to watch an animated gif.  I don't like cars all that much, but I understand the basics of an internal combustion engine, and know how to perform basic maintenance.    Yeah, but remember, even though the slide, etc. are heavier, the bullet is being pushed at much higher speed, so it probably balances out.   We need someone to do the math...    As opposed to what?   There's fundamentally nothing wrong with trigger-mounted safeties.    Probably not that much of a difference.   Basic Newton, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.   That said, it would make for an interesting experiment to conduct with a chronograph.    Then you should know better than to advocate for waving guns around with your finger on the trigger.    How much actual shooting experience do you have?   Who doesn't want to know how the Space Shuttle works?  Aside from the exorbitant cost and inability to go anywhere outside of Low-Earth orbit, the shuttle was pretty rad.   Because self-imposed ingorance on any subject is a shame.   The first rule of gun safety is to keep your finger off the trigger until the sights are aligned with the target.  Follow that rule with every gun and it cannot be inadvertently fired.     The scene you describe sounds almost exactly like a shot from the movie Apollo 13.      Given that the ISS is possibly the most expensive single thing ever built, and is not yet at end of life, deorbiting utter would be a really stupid idea.   Given the preceding sentence it wouldn't shock me if they opted to do just that.       Whenever the various multitude of systemic failures endemic to socialism are pointed out, the defender of that particular ideology invariably resorts to an argument that the state/leader under discussion couldn't possibly be an actual socialist/communist because reasons.       I was completely unaware that someone had gone to the trouble of categorizing the development of critical thinking in stages. A Google search on this resulted in some interesting reading.   I ask the question because you still weirdly obsessed with something that doesn't actually affect you.    Wow, you're really touchy about this.   As a kid, were you molested by an uncle or something?    Marriage was a way of consolidating wealth and power for generations long before your view of it as some sort of quaintly romantic, Victorian-defined expression of twue wuv.   I'll also note that if you're being honest about hewing to a traditional form of marriage, it would be one that would allow for multiple spouses and harem-style arrangements.       I always love the "no true socialist" argument.      I've still got the originals stashed in my basement somewhere. It was a 2-part crossover.            Does anyone remember that time when Archie teamed up with The Punisher?    Looks like they're doing a special issue or something.    Musket barrels don't have rifling, which is kind of a requirement for something to be a rifle.  :-)   Remember, if you're a reporter covering something you don't like but the people involved are all too decent to be attacked directly you can always undermine them by tying them to an unrelated incident that happened two decades ago with a completely different from group.       Muskets.       Most of what's on examine its more about giving your body enough of the proper building blocks so it can generate it's testosterone.   From what I've read, anything that claims to boost your body's testosterone levels above the natural levels is either marketing bs or steroids.   Ain't no such thing as a free lunch.    3-6 grams of DHA/EPA fish oil will cut down on soreness.    Expect to see more of this.   Looks like part of that 50mil Bloomberg is dumping into gun control is being used to disparate gun grabber organizations.          To add insult to injury, a lot of those supposed "industry donations" come from things like Midway USA's NRA Roundup program, which allows people to round up the amount of their purchase to the nearest 1-5 dollars, which is then donated to the NRA.    Happy to help!    Decot makes great prescription shooting glasses.   A little dorky looking, but functionally great.   Otherwise take a look at the products offered by Rudy Project.       Oh god, why did I click that link?    There is something disconcerting about Rolling Stone, which was founded by the counter culture, so lavishly blowing a member of the .01%.   I'm not sure who's more tiresome. Ardent drug warriors, or the useless stoners they demonize.   Garen Wintemute is a quack.  His "research" and resultant advocacy is what led to congress pasing the law forbidding the CDC from doing gun control advocacy.   Glad to see this get national media attention.    The first study was roundly dismissed for cherry picking data, and is evidently a statistical outlier, as it was the only state to see this effect.   http://humanevents.com/2014/03/02/lott-to-gp-johns-hopkins-gun-violence-study-flawed-twisted/  The second study is a tautology, and shows no correlation to a drop in overall violent crime, only "gun crime" which implies that in the absence of a firearm, criminals aren't less violent, but are happy to substitute other methods that are presumably just as effective.   In any event, the study is behind a pay wall, so we can't even see what sort of criteria they used or what laws were specifically evaluated.    This is hilarious.     If there were facts showing these laws to be a net societal benefit, the advocates for them did a poor job of presenting their case when they instead opted to rely on culture war stereotypes, appeals to emotion, procedural shenanigans designed to minimize dissent, and outright misinformation.   Furthermore, if the laws were effective, the would be plenty of proof of this from the states that have similar laws in place, as well as from the Federal law that was in place from 1994-2004.  Unfortunately, the is no compelling evidence that the laws worked, and your justification is the political equivalent of a creationist who makes a "God of the gaps" argument.   This gives rise to the problem of now having laws on the books that don't actually reduce violence, but do create a legalistic mine field for citizens who wish to stay on the right side of the law.      Take it up with the staff at /r/progun.  They don't seem to mind.    They offered all sorts of attempts to fix the bills during the (artificially limited) Senate hearings.   The only one the democrats paid any attention to was when it was pointed out that their shiny new magazine ban would outlaw great grandpappy's huntin' shotgun, and then there was a mad dash to amend the law before it became an outright gun ban.   If you're truly interested, the video from the Senate and House hearings should still be on the websites for those respective legislative bodies.    It's not an opinion to point out that nearly every mass shooter successfully passed a background check, and that the current law would not have stopped people like the Aurora theater shooter.   Its not an opinion to point out that the magazine ban is useless because it is unenforceable and easily circumvented.   Nor is it an opinion to point out that the background check law won't stop someone from selling a gun to a criminal nor does it do anything to stop straw purchases.   Sure, we can quibble over whether the laws put undue burdens on lawful citizens, and certainly those beliefs are largely a matter of opinion, but the bottom line is that the laws were poorly conceived and unlikely to result in measurable public good.    The GOP did offer assistance, it was roundly ignored by a bunch of politicians who would likely be unable to tell you which end of a gun the bullet comes out of.    Heh. Thanks. :-)   Because it's funny.    OH NOES SOMEONE POSTED SOMETHING TO MULTIPLE SUBS!   There's really no need to work to discredit the laws, they're so poorly written only an idiot would argue that they're actually effective at reducing violence in any meaningful way.    Yawn.   Yet more projection from a moron who doesn't even know me.   As I said, you're boring.            The actual quote from hizzoner:  The NRA went after two or three state Senators in a part of Colorado where I dont think theres roads. Its as far rural as you can get.   You're boring.    I know this isn't strictly gun-related, but it was too great not to share.       I'm sorry, I had trouble reading your past because I was laughing so hard at your obvious philosophical blind spot.   Have fun watching Fox News.   I don't know why, but that makes me laugh every time I see it.          I know the song of my people.   :-)   Slate?   Why don't you cite Fox News while you're at it.    Especially when that one anecdote is used to pass a law that could result in people going to jail for utterly idiotic reasons.    Muh roads!   	176

We'd been doing consistent daytime flyovers of the tribal regions to the east, getting intel back to logistics.    One day me and crew were flying the C130 on a recon and everything is peachy till we get about half way through return from the AO and we start getting peppered with small arms fire which is strange considering how high up we were. Turns out logistics screwed up and sent us over heavily populated Al Qaeda mountains. So there I am manning my console, trying to do my job and not get shot. RPGs are missing the plane by just a few feet.     After about five minutes, we make it clear of the enemy fire and I'm able to take a breath. I look at my console and it has a 7.62 right through the middle of it. It's broken. I cal my CO over to take a look at it and he tells me that 7.62 rounds can make 30k feet. No, he said. That there is tree fiddy rounds. And I said tree fiddy? We ain't got no Loch Ness monster in al Qaeda firing no tree fiddy rounds.   Tom Cruise.   But Kim jr already fits the wardrobe.   If I had the money I no like also.   You know what this show needs? More Lori.   2cond um queer.   This is literally the worst.   Math. Boom hacked the universe.   The audience decides how much morphine the patient receives...you know for charity.   Mr. Rogers. Anyone can watch a well written show but everyone should know the purity of Mr. Rogers neighborhood.   "There's only one person in this whole world like you. And people can like you exactly as you are."   Hmm he knows words. Upvote.   You'd get a raise for exercise and secks.   When I was 10 I almost drowned my dad in his sleep.   Maybe feathered pillows, so every now and then you get a quill in the eye.   I can totally see the lack of tension between the two entertainers.    Comedians tend to relate to each other and flock to one another, particularly before major success just as a method of survival.   We expect them to have animosity for each other because they are/were on competing networks but their mainly like distant cousins whose paths, for the most part, parted after friendship.   You must be a professional.   Possibly the best time for this Gif.      So hard being the Prince of Gotham.   it would be nice to see if anyone makes an accurate prediction.   One of their best.   Shoot the hostage.   ...Like a watch.   It's very easy to point to a recent movie trailer and say it's one of the greatest of all times. Case in point, The Wolf of Wall Street. I'm asking if you can recall a movie trailer preceeding 2010 that is truly great to look at and garners excitement for that movie.  [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN3YaybNJ2s)   Watch Hannibal. Shit gets crazy.   The Dark Knight ~~Rises~~   Nolan likes filming his movies in IMAX. You could be missing out.    Look people complain about the Dark knight being about 30 minutes too long. For me, I was more than glad it was so long, I wish it was longer. When I heard about this, I got giddy.  1) Chris Nolan  2)Space!  3)Matthew Mcconaughey   All those people. Must take alot of: "Everybody run silently to the back so we can blow up this cafe." And the people outside must have ear plugs.   Do you have a logline?    "I found this book under my bed mom, would you read it to me?"   "What's this Mein Kampf? Sure, I didn't know you were into European literature."   Two of those people lost their funny mojo, IMO.   Nice try struggling writer.   We'll get the actual documentary in about 5 years, give or take.   Dune was so much internal dialogue. No.   alpha Bravo Charlie Delta echo Golf Hotel India Juliet kilo Lima Mike November October Papa Quebec Romeo Sierra tango uniform Victor whiskey Yankee Zulu  Edit: I missed Foxtrot and X-ray. I did this orally on my phone   ESPN needs to get on this shit.   Nice! I'm into that kinda stuff!   Would like to see behind the scenes.   Hey hey....but it cured cancer. so it saved half the world population by killing the other half.   I thought the scare at the backdoor was effective even though I was expecting it.    I also liked the use of 1st person to build tension and atmosphere.   Jeremy Renner was supposed to take over the Mission Impossible franchise and was then offered the Bourne franchise. Tom Cruise's movie underperformed I think Knight and Day, then he came back to reclaim MI. And now this.   But...taxes.   Why, cause he killed a bird? Frank killed a dog and 2 people...but mainly a dog.   Ulysses...or Bosco.   Best buds for life. I wish.   Dogs are the best.  	109
 Why would all the court officers leave these people alone in a room?      What advice would you give to identify the good ones?   And thank you for yours. It is nice to have a civil discussion about a serious issue.   I do think it is a little funny that you mention the monetary interest because I am a public defender at the moment in a jurisdiction that pays me a salary, not based on the number of cases I have. In other words it is not in my interest to have more cases or more clients. Not all advice from attorneys comes from their interest in being paid. Unfortunately, there are many attorneys whose advice is based upon how much money they can make. It is something that sickens me.  Obviously, I do not know where you were an officer but unfortunately my experience has not been the same as yours. I wish what you said about officer discretion working in the public's favor most of the time was true in my jurisdiction. I do not think it is.   While I do understand where you are coming from I stand by my original advice. Having those charges dropped or reduced could just as easily have occurred after you receive an attorney without any chance of incriminating yourself even unknowingly. If a person is innocent then having an attorney can go a long way to showing that. The risk of saying the wrong thing even if you did not do it is too high. Like you said there are innocent people who are convicted of crimes based on speaking with the police.   I am a criminal defense attorney. Please stop talking to the police when you are suspected of a crime, brought in for questioning, etc. The police may make promises to you, they may lie to you, and they may pretend to be your best friend. They are not your friends, they can break promises, and they legally can lie. You are not going to be able to talk your way out of it. Ask for an attorney and then remain silent. It never ceases to amaze me how many of my clients confess their hearts out the police or give information that hurts their cases. It is one of the few things TV and movies have correct; talking to the police will hurt your defense.   What is your job? Choose one piece of advice based on it. Why is that advice important?   People like this always amaze me. He was pro-police and took pictures of them doing things to other people with no problem but now that it effects him he sees the truth.   Race came into play because the all white (or almost all white) privileged lacrosse team was accused of raping a poor black woman and calling her racial slurs. The DA used this to stir up racial tension in order to win the black community's vote to get reelected. He was later disbarred as a direct result of how he handled this case. Race played a major part in the case.  I personally do not think the ad went far enough to be considered defamatory under the law but it is not exactly as clear cut as you portray it. This line in particular sticks out to me: "These students are shouting and whispering about what happened to this young woman and to themselves." It clearly implies that something bad happened to her and less specifically indicating the crime committed against her. Some people were actually accused of this so to say that it happened is to say that the charges are against them are at least partially true. We now know beyond a reasonable doubt that the accusations were a complete fabrication.  The ad was also a timing issue. These professors chose to exploit this situation as if it absolutely happened. And some of them were also proven to have made statements and taken actions well beyond the ad which led many to believe that reading the ad in the most negative light was appropriate. For example, one of the professors failing two of the lacrosse students without good [cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_88#Duke_students_and_faculty).   To say that this was not related to the lacrosse players and the rape charges is to ignore the context this ad appeared in. While again I do not think it rises to the level of defamation I absolutely believed this was aimed at the lacrosse players and ignored innocent until proven guilty. There was an assumption that the woman's story was true and it clearly was not.   [Here](http://today.duke.edu/showcase/mmedia/pdf/socialdisasterad.pdf) (PDF) is a link.   I was speaking more in generalities that making false statements about a group or business can still be considered defamation. I haven't looked at the actual advertisement the professors took out in many years. I just reread it [now](http://today.duke.edu/showcase/mmedia/pdf/socialdisasterad.pdf) (PDF). It is arguable that parts of it falsely implied that the lacrosse players were perpetrators of a crime. It would have be an interesting case.   While you cannot successfully be sued for "condemning" a company you can absolutely be sued for defamation by them if you were to make false accusations about them. Defamation applies to businesses as well as individuals and before this becomes an issue, this has been true well before the Citizens United decision.   Yeah calling someone a racial slur is equivalent to being slandered across the country with a false rape accusation, being charged with rape, and facing the possibility of years in prison. Completely fair.   A lawsuit is different than criminal charges. You do not have to commit a crime in order to be successfully sued. I do not remember the specifics of the petition but if it wrongfully accused the players of crimes they did not actually commit (which I think it did) then a lawsuit for defamation is more than appropriate.   This is why it is so terrible that prosecutors have immunity. We will not see true justice done until that protection is removed.   The New York Daily News is not usually considered a right-leaning newspaper unlike the New York Post. The Post is also more well known for their sensationalistic and sometimes humorous headlines. But both papers tend to do whatever convinces people to buy their slowly dying medium.  	17

 I called and spoke with toyota. A Toyota official recall never expires, limited repair campaigns do. The frame rust issues were a recall, and thus should never expire. As I understand it. I had my frame undercoated just this past year, well past April 2012.   I agree with you for sure, love that low end. I'd love to see that little turbodiesel they've got in Australia make its way into the U.S. But yeah the frame can be a problem. Took mine to the local stealership this year and they did a full inspection. Ended up getting a new undercoat on toyota's dime.   My girl's a 4x4, but I'm glad to see there's some other 1st gen enthusiasts around, too good a truck not to have some fans   Well I can't speak to that, but they certainly are a lot bigger. I always liked my truck cuz it seemed a little smaller than the big three, but now I've got tacos looking down in my windows...manhood takes a shot...   2000 Tundra SR5, little spacer lift the old man put on when he bought it a 7k miles, I just rolled over 190k this week. Daily driver, but works well as a hunting and farm truck too, hauls the shit outta hedge posts.      Yeah reach out to the national baja SAE folks and maybe some of the advisors/instructors in mechanical and civil engineering if your school offers those specialties. Or even contact some other schools and ask how they got theirs started.  	7

 yaaaaassssssssss   not if charles died and he's just impersonating him.      Lucas is A. He was seen with a black hoodie, he has motive, he may have been adopted, he loves toy planes and cars. Yeah I think he's Charles   thank you so much for the pictures. I now think and I think it seems to fit more, that Charles is Lucas. But thank you very much for the pics.   thanks for posting original link.    I dunno it happened in an episode.     	8
    This is why there *never* will be "normal" relations between the US and Cuba -- certainly not anything like US-UK, or US-French, or US-Mali relations.  Cuba is simply independent and does not follow Washington's orders. For that reason the thaw in US relations with Cuba is not a real normalization, it's simply a tactic used by the US to achieve the US' ultimate goal -- the reversal of the Cuban revolution and the return of Cuba to its former status as a US vassal state.     Mods should delete this shit.   I disagree! Deleting this filth is simple censorship. Reddit has these wonderful tools -- upvote and downvote buttons -- to reflect how people feel about posts like this.  Instead of deletion, simply downvote the post into oblivion and, if you're of a mind, add a comment on why this post is utter garbage.   Relevant: [The Death of Kathryn Steinle: Turning Tragedy into Racist, Anti-Immigrant Hysteria](http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/07/15/the-death-of-kathryn-steinle-turning-tragedy-into-racist-anti-immigrant-hysteria/).   Because our corporate mass media propaganda system preaches that incessantly as a statement of fact. It's just that simple.  It's the same thing with the claim that Iran is hell-bent on building a nuclear weapon. It doesn't matter that all dozen-plus of the US' intelligence agencies say Iran has no nuclear weapons program, the media (and government) makes the claim and endlessly repeats the false claim and millions either outright believe it or think there must be something to it.  We saw the same type of lies in other US wars -- everything from Vietnam to Iraq. Why did people believe that Iraq had WMD? Why do millions *still* believe that Iraq had WMD?   "If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it." -- Nazi Germany's propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels.   And we de facto control the Saudis -- Iran is independent and does not follow Washington's orders. *That* is the key.   The last time I was in the UK it was still possible to find pubs that served lukewarm beer. And since we're talking about barbarism, I thought that pretty much was the definition of that word. Glad to see you guys decided to join the rest of the modern world. :)   Stupid woman! There's no such law. Only banks can create new money -- she's not rich enough to do that!    Fine, but I will also assume you are British. How does that feel?  Bad. I don't like tea or warm beer.   So? why does it matter if it's in retaliation.  Burning buildings down is generally considered a pretty slimy, underhanded or barbaric way to fight a war -- it's not like the "honorable" task of shooting and blowing up other soldiers.  Thus, there is a difference between retaliating to barbarism with barbarism, as opposed to initiating such barbarism.   Seriously, you underestimate mindless American nationalism.  In the US today you will find *many* people who will argue with a straight face that the US did *not* lose the Vietnam War. Their "logic"? Because the US never lost any major battles and because Thailand, Malaysia and all of southeast Asia did not turn communist -- we really won. Complete victory was simply due to US politicians forcing the military to "fight with one hand behind its back" and the mass media/journalists undermining morale on the US home front.  Aside from mindless nationalism we excel at historical revisionism too!   I'm assuming you're British. The British burning down the US White House was *in* *retaliation* for US forces burning down York, Canada (York is now Toronto).   Our attempt to conquer (liberate?) Canada was the true start of the American empire.  Our imperial ambitions did not succeed in that war against Britain/Canada, but only a few decades later Mexico would pay dearly when we attacked and stole 1/2 of Mexico (basically, we took all of Mexico that didn't have lots and lots of Spanish-speaking, Catholic Mexicans living in it).    Don't know about this "elite" group you reference. Seemed to me like it was mostly the poor and misguided making up the ranks, when I was enlisted.   Quite true. This is an elite where anyone can join as long as you're willing to accept the indoctrination and play your assigned role in your particular branch of service[sic].   Your quote at the end suggests to me that you hold some strong opinions about the US military.  Eight years in the military and quite a bit of international experience, along with even more years of academic research, study and observation of US history and geo-politics will -- or should! -- do that to you.   "Militaristic Propoganda" seems a bit strong, no?  No, I don't think so. In an age where we *routinely* attack other countries and our military commits the most heinous war crimes with impunity, it takes many forms of nationalism and propaganda to whitewash the morals from people's minds to allow them to passively accept nullifying our civil liberties and the military's role. This article is just one piece of one form of that propaganda. More subtle than a military flyover at a football game, but it's much cheaper and likely more effective for the people who read it.   None, of course. But US policies against Iraq were/are not deliberately genocidal in intention. We just don't give a damn about the loss of life as long as the US is getting its way.   Exactly. Bernie has the support of the people, but unfortunately the US is a plutocratic oligarchy and money buys our elections.  The big corporate money won't really start rolling in until about halfway through the primaries. And we know that cash isn't going to be going to an actual left-leaning politician with the integrity that Sanders has. That money will instead go to a pro-corporate neo-liberal who will then buy the Democratic nomination.    And they do expect premiums to rise faster this year, largely because health-care costs are going up faster, too.  With an immoral system based on greedy, for-profit corporations where your indentured servant "customers" are forced to pay money under penalty of law, of course costs are going to skyrocket! What sort of idiot would think otherwise?  Obama could have installed a cheaper and more efficient single-payer health care system. But Obama unilaterally ruled such a system "off the table." Instead, our corporate stooge president sold the American people out as indentured servants to the private health insurance industry. And now we will pay the price of this sellout.  I won't comment on the irony of the country's first African-American president violating the 13th Amendment which prohibits slavery and indentured servitude. :(    No, what worries them much more deeply is that Iran might rejoin the community of nations, possibly even as a diplomatic (and eventually trading) partner of the United States and Europe.  I would disagree. What worries those opposed to the deal is that it *lessens* the ability of the US to enact regime change on Iran.  The US' goal is hegemony over the entire Middle East -- to have the entire region composed of US vassal states that will follow Washington's orders.  Iran is *independent.* An Iran integrated into the global community without sanctions is an Iran that will continue to be independent of Washington's orders. *That* is what imperialists in Washington oppose, that is why they created the fiction about nuclear weapons, and that is why they support regime change in Iran.   "I hate all forms of imperialism, and I consider the US brand to be the most loathsome and contemptible." -- Nelson Mandela.    It appears that the source of the lies was the Administration prior to President Bush.  As the article points out, Clinton knew fully well that Iraq had no WMD. Madeline Albright's famous line that the deaths of 1/2 million Iraqi children was acceptable to keep UN sanctions on Iraq was a complete lie -- those children died as a result of US lies and geo-political imperial games.  Bush was just the tyrant that added more lies to the existing lies and then pulled the trigger on the 2003 Iraqi invasion and subsequent occupation.  The bottom line is that the 20+ years of war on Iraq and all of the US lies and aggression against Iraq were *bi-partisan* moves. The only difference between our 2 ruling parties were petty arguments over tactics. Blood drips from *both* parties' hands.   "The greatest crime since World War II has been U.S. foreign policy." -- Ramsey Clark, former U.S. Attorney General.   Well, the Greek people *have* been betrayed. A week after they voted against austerity their treacherous government caved into the capitalists and banksters and sold the Greek people out.  Greeks *should* *be* pissed. They have every right to be.       Israels involvement in Suleimans assassination raises questions about both the purpose of the killing, as well as whether Israel violated international law in conducting the operation.  Give me a frigging break. We have to wonder whether going onto another country's soil and launching a military operation to assassinate one of their high-ranking uniformed military officers is a violation of international law?  Let's be serious.  This is politically correct madness -- it's an act of war by Israel, plain and simple. It's just that Israel is protected by the US and Syria is under attack so the Syrians cannot respond to the Israeli bully.    So then here we have just a clear systemic institutionalized effort laid bare, but of course that's not enough either is it, still not enough,   Exactly. It's the same concept that keeps our government's skulduggery overseas going. When the US-backed/trained/funded/armed Egyptian military overthrows an elected government and enacts a reign of terror murdering hundreds of civilian supporters of the government, the US claims we had nothing to do with it -- and people swallow it.  When we fund the violent overthrow of an elected government in Ukraine for the second time in ten years, even though we have a tape recording of US diplomats arranging the coup and picking out the new prime minister, the US denies any involvement and then point fingers at Russia and claims they're the aggressor -- and people swallow it.  Countless police murders of mostly blacks but yet the government says it's not racist and that we don't have a massive, systemic problem of police brutality, oppression and murder -- and people swallow it.  It seems the American people have an infinite ability to ignore the truth and to believe BS.   "The great moral American people would rather believe government lies than to acknowledge the government's crimes and to hold the government accountable." -- Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan administration and Associate Editor of the Wall Street Journal Paul Craig Roberts.   No, different capitalists/oligarchs.  Just the same mindsets, greed and values.      Sorry, the next time I see Jimmy Carter I'll correct him. :)  **Edit:** Seriously, wasn't "marijuana" the name invented when our corrupt government was beating the drum back in the "[Reefer Madness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZ_s_cu02s)" days of the 1930s to make marijuana illegal?  As I recall, by giving the weed a Spanish name the anti-drug propagandists orchestrating the prohibition PR campaign were deliberately trying to smear the drug by associating it with Mexicans.     it's existence of a system within which nothing can practically be done, while thoughts of going outside of said system have been systematically suppressed.  That's perfectly true. No disagreement there.   You're acting as if bourgeoisie democracy actually behaves democratically,  No, what I'm saying is that we're doing a *terrible* job organizing and educating people. There are avenues for opposition and organization and we're not taking sufficient advantage of that. Sure, people are indoctrinated to feel powerless, to laugh at serious problems by watching the Daily Show and other entertainment, etc., etc.  But as true as all that is, that doesn't address our issues and without addressing those issues we're doomed to spiral towards barbarism.    But a possible dark truth could be that without civil forfeiture (cash, cars, etc to sell), departments may be underfunded.   That's like saying a school or a bridge repair project may be underfunded.  I mean, if something is underfunded then the decision is easy -- either increase taxes to fund the item, or decide to do without it. It's simple.  A third choice of stealing from people without due process of law -- asset forfeiture -- is not a valid choice in any country that claims to adhere by the rule of law.  **Edit:** Downvotes for Oznog99 (the post above) are uncalled for. He merely pointed out the reality. Just like our corrupt government runs budget deficits year after year because it refuses to raise taxes, some police agencies may operate only because they steal property via asset forfeiture to fund themselves. I read Oznog99's writing not as an advocacy of this type of theft, but as a blunt statement of reality. We should stop avoiding reality and admit the truth.   Isn't that like trying to claim that NYC is the safest part of the US because there's 30K police in the city?  But to answer your question, I'd guess some remote village in eastern Siberia where everyone in the village knows everyone else.   That's because our government is *so* *broken* and so corrupt, and the 2 political parties that rule the country are so non-representative and dysfunctional, that appealing to their greedy side is the only way marijuana users can get them to legalize the weed that never should have been made illegal in the first place.   "Penalties against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself; and where they are, they should be changed. Nowhere is this more clear than in the laws against possession of marihuana in private for personal use." -- U.S. President Jimmy Carter, 1977.   "Disobedience, in the eyes of anyone who has read history, is humanity's original virtue. It is through disobedience that progress has been made, through disobedience and through rebellion." -- Oscar Wilde, Soul of Man Under Socialism.      So a report by one of the US government's propaganda organ gets a couple of friendly "experts" to come out with a sweeping conclusion about our benevolence and kind-hearted wars.  Color me not impressed.   "Propaganda is to a democracy what violence is to a dictatorship." -- Noam Chomsky.    Any degree of impairment is an unnecessary risk.  That's perfectly true. His point that he *felt* "completely safe" is absurd -- isn't that one of the things that "under the influence" does to you?!  The point that should have been made is that a stoned driver is not the same as a drunk driver. Neither is as safe as a sober driver, but there is a *big* difference between the two.      A thought-provoking, well-explained piece which highlights that the real left and the far-right do indeed see some problems in an identical light, and -- maybe -- can work together to deal with the problem.  And if this is true on a racially-charged issue like incarceration, why not on issues like civil liberties and/or domestic spying?   Since there was no way you could have watched the piece in the time before you posted, unless you watched this earlier in the day, I have to wonder how you could come to such a quick conclusion.  What were your thoughts about the Koch representative/spokesman's points and personal stories featured in the report?  Are you saying that Van Jones is a gullible fool and that he came to the wrong conclusion when he talked about his wrestling with the fact that it was a Koch brothers campaign that forced him to resign from the White House but that he saw this as a bigger, more important issue than his own personal grievance?  Please, give me *something* to convince me that you're not just doing some Yellow Dog Democratic knee-jerk thing without even viewing the video.   Follow the money...   "There can be no effective control of corporations while their political activity remains. To put an end to it will be neither a short nor an easy task, but it can be done." -- US President Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt  	37
 I'll start. I listen to Rush and prog rock as much as I listen to what is considered "hip" or "trendy" today. That and some awesome more dad esc yaght rock; I am far from a dad. What do you listen to that would make your friends go "hmmm"?      [Harry...](http://24.media.tumblr.com/14832d03a57d8cacef89ec57dbca5d90/tumblr_mjfxfsibE51s83re0o1_500.gif)            Oh man I love those. My absolute favorite is 'Turtle Bones'.   We racked a blueberry ale to secondary and bottled that little bit of cinnamon cider. Super pumped about that blueberry ale. Were calling it Brewberry Yum-Yum.      Shit   My mom always said to stop eating such spicy food. Now I can use this as ammo against her. Take that Mom      Source http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-32157618         Whoever writes these editorial headlines needs to watch an ehow.com video. Says she died at 117 weeks old   DAMN SON! Got me lol. Yea you're right still awesome AF tho right?? 'Pride' by Dynamo is killer. Their vocalist has a beautiful voice.    Bill Laurance was an original member Snarky Puppy, not to mention many of the personnel on his new record are from the current incarnation of the group. This includes Snarky Puppy's leader Michael League on bass and "Sput", one of their amazing drummers. Makes sense to me that Bill Laurance would record his album in similar Snarky Puppy fashion. The 'live' recording setup seems to work well for Ropeadope artists.   As far as the musical influence, I hear something that strays a bit further left field from Snarky Puppy's concept of sound but I can totally understand what you're saying. In my opinion 'Swift', Laurance's new record, strays further away from the gospel of fusion that Snarky Puppy has given us and has taken an almost Phillip Glass contemporary classical oriented approach. The textures and themes throughout the songs almost are reminiscent of minimalist music of the 20th century. Sprinkle some Snarky Puppy juice on there and you have one hell of a musical cocktail.    If our beer sucks, oh well. We love it and so do our friends so we thought we would give it a whirl!   I agree. So pumped for their album. If you like Snarky Puppy and Bill Laurance you'd love Dynamo. Check out (Pride)[ Dynamo - Pride (Find Your Way)[https://youtu.be/wUxXaHdzxQU]      That is a very quick jump to the extreme   and for regular-sized Snarky Puppy with full Orchestra check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoF7ZzMUrgA spfreload=10) out!

 This is very depressing.     Good luck!  We found our daughter's sex at 14w3d.  Hope everyone's happy and healthy xoxo   While I have a disgust for the place I've mentioned, that is definitely not how I feel about every place of worship.   While I am a firm atheist, I at least have respect for the establishments that keep it more humble and honest.     Right?  That's about the only thing that religion has to go on.    That's very true.  I just feel like it is becoming more obvious, making it harder to take more people of faith seriously.    That's the way I feel.  My mind wasn't already made before I got there, I was actually being optimistic about seeing how some churches run nowadays.    This was something I looked into recently.  His wealth is something that he is very good at making it seem legit.  But I'd love to see those books.   He has a net worth of 50 million, but insists that is from book sales and other means.  He hasn't taken an income from the actual church since 2005.  That church is said to bring in on average 32 million.   He also doesn't own his mansion, something that I didn't look into further yet.  But it belongs to Covenant Trust, no idea, but that could possibly be a way of avoiding taxes.     They probably think they are around good christian folk that would never do anything unchristlike.       Edit:  I love it though, I promise.   Oh god!  I love him.   I actually think *you* hit the nail on the head, thank you.   And the strong people, usually take the role as leader.   And maybe they like to keep tabs on who actually gives them money.   These people's interests are just superficial,  they only *want* other people to think they love that shit.  Nobody does.  Give me a place that's real, goddammit.    I mean, maybe like a bar/lounge band.  Then you'd also get to *drink* and see shitty music.     Yea my cousin puts in 50, and admits it should be more.  I wanted to scream.  I haven't done the math,  I just know that he's an electrician with his own business, so I'm sure 10% for him would be more than 50.     At our church in my hometown, it was more like 50-75 people a week.  It being a depressed area, a lot of people just gave some change.  Which I found, even as a child, to be extremely fair and noble of them.   I'm sure it started with seeding, but these motherfuckers were so delighted to hand over their money, they couldn't pass it fast enough.  Some *were* in envelopes so I couldn't see the amount.   See, this was something that I always thought was specific to certain denominations.  But I have learned this is the standard now across the board.    When did this happen?  My family would have never agreed to that 20 years ago.  My mom always thought she was extremely generous with $5/week in the plate.   That I'd have a lot more respect for if it was a fair, tax - paying establishment.  If that's all that people want, it shouldn't be in the name of Jesus, based on what he's about he wouldn't have anything to do with these "mega churches."   This church is called Cottonwood.  It's in Orange County.   Thank you.  After seeing that place, I Googled Joel Osteen's church.  Jesussss.  Stadium churches.   Well I understand that completely, thank you.  But how can you expect checks?  How can the church consciously tell people to write checks.  I didn't see checks in there for $1, most were $50.  People are breaking the bank to pay for the lighting and sound system in this ridiculous amphitheater.    "Good Christians deserve a nice place of worship."  That's all my cousins could really say about the whole thing.   [Was greeted at the door with one of these, wafer on top, grape juice on bottom](http://www.imgur.com/5YHjMWd.jpeg)  [This place isn't exactly a humble place of worship](http://www.imgur.com/Xo6Dmtp.jpeg). Looks like it takes quite a bit of money to produce this setup... and those single-serve communion cups.  Get in and sit down, the first 35 min is a small, young, rock band singing faith songs.  Everyone with hands in the air, really pretending to feel this lame music.  Then we finally have someone preaching.  But he never opens a bible or tells us to open ours.  He just starts telling us anecdotal stories and his own interpretations of stories from the bible.    When the collection plate passed me,  I noticed it was all checks, no one gives paper money anymore, let alone change.    Towards the end, the preacher kept reminding us repeatedly to join some workshops next month, not free of course.  No thanks.   I just remember church when I was a child as being humble.  All we ever did was read from the bible and sing together.  No one had to hand over their paychecks.  Now it has just turned into this business,  that is so disgusting I couldn't stand being there.  I've been an atheist for the majority of my life now, but seeing that first hand just blew my asshole off.   Well then this isn't about your Preacher.  There are some good people out there who genuinely do it because they are good people, and they were good before they knew about religion.    The first people I thought of were the ones on TV that sell holy water or magic towels.  They are bad people, and profit off of the weak who want to be saved.     It's absolutely normal :')  Just so you know this level of worry will continue the rest of your life about your children!  Just know, you are doing everything you can to give your baby the best chance possible.  Things can happen that are out of your control, but dont think about it.  Today you are pregnant, and you love your baby!     [That seems a little slow for 9w6d](http://radiopaedia.org/articles/fetal-heart-rate)   Man, there is nothing I was able to do.  It gets so hard sometines.  But it sounds like you're doing what you can, maybe someone else here has miracle advice. :D   While he might have been trolling or joking, it's not *incorrect* advice.  Perming asian hair really would soften it and make it a lot more desirable to work with.  It's not a realistic option, and I'm not telling OP to do it, but it would have the benefits he is after.   Chocolate coca-cola!  But sweet potato fries sound amazing...   Love hearing positive things.     Whoa nice! Xoxo   You said it.  A lifetime of worry.  Even after you get into second tri, you're going to be anxious til birth.  Then you'll be anxious til it's out of the possible SIDS age.  Miscarriage is a terrible, heartbreaking tragedy, but know that if it were to happen, it was because something was wrong and it needed to.    I've had one previous miscarriage at 8.5 weeks.  Not sure of the cause.  This year, my Dr put me on progesterone until I was 10 weeks.  Now I'm 14 weetks.  Trying to be positive and patient.    The one thing I could suggest is that you get a doppler.  I know you run the risk of more worry if you couldn't find it.  But I got one and was able to find the heartbeat at 10 weeks, and every day since.  Just an idea.   I'm the same.  I got a doppler, I know people say that if you don't find a heartbeat it could cause you extra worry.  But ever since I found the heartbeat the first time, I never had a problem since.  I'm exactly 14w today.  Just sharing xoxo   Goddammit.  What is it with some women.  I don't attribute that to different taste, I'd just say her brain space is vacant.   I love that she stayed excited the whole time, I thought we'd eventually see an epic meltdown.   Yes very!  And impressive!   I think it's an amazing idea.   I think that movie was underrated.  I always tell people to watch it, and that it rivals "Waiting."  Loved it.   That's a heartwarming thing to know, Thank you.   You guys have to understand how many people would love to see this happen.  I've never talked to a single person that didn't love Super Troopers.     That's what I try to tell people.  But they always reply, "It doesn't have meaning?  They don't mean *anything*?"    No.  Stop acting like you have a pinup girl and an anchor because some distant relative was in the Navy, just admit it's what you like or want.  Forced meaning is the most disingenuous thing.   That is something my car automatically does, that makes sense now.  Thank you.   I'm very uneducated about CPR, which I'm now inspired to change in the very near future.    But I never knew there needed to be no pulse to proceed with CPR.  If someone is drowning in a swimming pool, you pull them out, would they have a pulse?  Or would they just be choking and need a different CPR?   [Some people always hated it](http://youtu.be/TOBfpHv1VcI)  *"Hi, I'm a video DJ.  I always talk like I'm wigged out on quaaludes.

I can't wiki it   I am 12 weeks now, I only really felt symptoms between 8 and 10 weeks.  That's when I had morning sickness and that's when my fatigue felt the strongest.     [I found this interesting about babies](http://youtu.be/PgkZf6jVdVg)   I definitely thought I'd have to scroll a hell of a lot farther to find what I was going to type.  I miss these damn things.   [There's a lot on this website](https://www.tshirthell.com/hell.shtml)   I've been seeing this stuff all over social media in the last week and I never once saw it connected to ALS.    Awareness and donations are beautiful, but the cause should at least be mentioned, wth.   This reminds me of my favorite (long) quote from Patton Oswalt.  "I remember, when 9/11 went down, my reaction was, "Well, I've had it with humanity."  But I was wrong. I don't know what's going to be revealed to be behind all of this mayhem. One human insect or a poisonous mass of broken sociopaths.  But here's what I DO know. If it's one person or a HUNDRED people, that number is not even a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the population on this planet. You watch the videos of the carnage and there are people running TOWARDS the destruction to help out. (Thanks FAKE Gallery founder and owner Paul Kozlowski for pointing this out to me). This is a giant planet and we're lucky to live on it but there are prices and penalties incurred for the daily miracle of existence. One of them is, every once in awhile, the wiring of a tiny sliver of the species gets snarled and they're pointed towards darkness.  But the vast majority stands against that darkness and, like white blood cells attacking a virus, they dilute and weaken and eventually wash away the evil doers and, more importantly, the damage they wreak. This is beyond religion or creed or nation. We would not be here if humanity were inherently evil. We'd have eaten ourselves alive long ago.  So when you spot violence, or bigotry, or intolerance or fear or just garden-variety misogyny, hatred or ignorance, just look it in the eye and think, "The good outnumber you, and we always will."   Maybe my brain doesn't work right, but I feel like you didn't add more than he did.  He shared his unexplained opinion, and you just said "opinions."   Yea, so the guy getting downvoted can't have the opinion of disagreement?  This is a weird place.   Yea, not a smart move.  That would annoy any demographic.  Except maybe Clark Griswald.   :'( I'm sorry.    Or just sort by controversial.    *classic misdirection*   Neither is Fag.   Bowel distention.

[She surprised the hell out of me](http://youtu.be/JK_DOJa99oo)   This is my experience with miscarriages, ::warning, not a happy discussion:: it always takes a while for my body to start to get rid of the baby.  First I felt a complete loss of symptoms,  then it took anywhere from 3-5 weeks for me to have bleeding and painful cramps.    So I'd personally say it looks good for you if you still have frequent urination among *any* other symptoms.  That means the hcg is still present.  Have you seen or heard a heartbeat yet?  What other symptoms do you feel?   [Old Spice has been creeping me out lately.](http://youtu.be/vhbd4ZajKD0)   All the songs with "Na Na" in it right now.  Jesus.

When I was learning how to drive my mom told me that if I go the exact speed limit, I will make every green light.  I knew she was bullshitting me, I would have much rathered her be honest and just ask me to drive carefully.   What was your family's reasoning for using such harsh language? Couldn't they have gotten their point across more eloquently by not using such words as "fags?"    I've always viewed them as crazy(sorry), but they might have earned more credibility if their language wasn't so vulgar and inappropriate.  It especially confused me when I learned more about your family and how intelligent they all were, and that a lot of them are even lawyers.    You just made me feel a lot better.  :')   I'm 8w3d.  I've had a previous Mc, so this time my Dr put me on progesterone pills from week 7 to week 12.  These pills have made my pregnancy symptoms so strong that I'm afraid I won't be able to tell if I Mc and have a loss of symptoms.  I've had very strong nausea for a couple weeks now, but idk if it's from the pills or my pregnancy.  When I miscarried last time I didn't have cramps or bleeding for weeks after the baby died, but the loss of symptoms happened very quickly.  My first appointment is August 11, all they've done for me so far was draw blood and write me a prescription.  I'm just scared and needed to vent.  Thanks for listening. :(   [Yea he's a winner](http://truthaboutdahvie.tumblr.com/post/40316532001/dahvie-vanity-allegation-roundup)   Oh boy.  How could John Cusack turn *that* down...   I thought that was too long too, my Dr.  is the same way!  I did exactly what you're doing!  Have fun at your first ultrasound, it's magical.  Edit:  My Dr. also says my insurance only covers one ultrasound per pregnancy, at 20 weeks!  How ridiculous is that.     Some people can't handle Vegas.   Strong genes!   Man, when I first found out, my headache lasted a week.  I'm so excited for you!  	103
 You've complained about this for so long, please stfu and git gud.  The rest of the players either just play him or moved on, quit whining like a little school girl.  Micro is harder now, you just have to pay attention and stop being lazy.   Other than the Trolly comments (2015 people, grow up stop being ignorant), I do agree Sativa is better for playing DotA.  Don't touch indica if you wanna keep mmr, but everyone reacts differently.   I expect Reddit to be there.   I've gone public.   asshole   Laker fan since 93, only new Laker fans think mitch knows what the fuck he's doing.  You have to really know the lakers organization way back to understand how much of a doofus he is, if you're some bandwagon fan, you probably don't know shit.   According to the morons on this subreddit, I'm supposed to think he has a brain and knows how to steer this ship.  Probably weren't laker fans for long if they think Mitch is passable as a GM.    Well played, guy.  That was a good laugh.  	8

There should at least be a one week grace period before things can be reposted!      My parents couldn't afford the Razor brand when these first came out so they got me a knockoff brand.    I was riding down a slight decline when I pulled up on the handle bars and they came right off.   Shattered my wrist.    Worst 21st bday ever.     I thought your mom didn't like Australian's mate?   Not yet...   damnit   It's funny I used to envy my friends household when I was younger.   Wealthier family, cleaner home and a distinct smell.   Now, living on my own trying out different routines. I will come across certain smells, distinct smells, that remind me of my childhood and I forgot what point I was making. Nvm     I got a similar  text when I started college in 2008 except I had a cat. And that cat didn't miss me either she was just ratting me out.     This is what happened:  In my room I had a old TV stand that had about 1/2 of clearing from the carpet to the base.  Well young me used to keep everything under there.   Cigs-Porn-Condoms-Pot and anything else you can think of that a teenage boy would horde from his parents.   9-12th grade I was keeping items under here.  Now I moved away and completely forgot about my hidden stash, since I only lived an hour away my parents kept my room the same, so I would have a place to crash.    Well about 2 weeks after I moved I guess my cat went into my room and started pawing at everything under the tv stand.   Parents came into the room and saw couple cigs and edge of a mag.    Got an awesome call that day!   Thanks cat.   That's normal, but now call CSI and have them check it for semen to do a DNA test     Yes I have. My Aunt lives there.     Hey look something that made me laugh in /r/funny.    Pretty sure it's a fitted hat.    SnapBack would be quite bananas to make.     Seriously!  Everyone knows that's Minnesota.    You can see the fear in his eyes.     This Gif is me walking home at bar close.     Man if I was evil n had a truck and a couple friends and was pretty strong, I would steal that motor.     I'm wearing the exact same thing as nick besides the ring.   Even my sunglasses hanging on the shirt.     Haha check it.   .   Yes, good memories!    Seriously I was getting pissed, I was pretty determined it was a loop towards the end.    DNA Bitch!   Is that couch comfortable?   *bolts upstairs*   Has a Pixar feel to it.  I like it.     Just watched it couple nights ago.  Classic!   no prob,  great movie!   codes are a go       Probably clogged, just run a snake pipe cleaner thru it.   Jerked him off to death.      I should of been more clear on this.   This is for only walk-ins I will do this.  We usually have a full day of schedule appt, but you get a couple walk-ins and most will set up a next day appt.   Some customers are either out of town or just can't get an appt set up.  These are the customer that will do a quick (15-30min) inspection.   Everyone should be charged the min, but I gift the nice patient ones.         Wasn't there someone who farted for their power    Yes-  I work in an audio shop that does installs of all sorts.   We also troubleshoot a lot of oem products that come standard on most cars, common case is a factory radio.   People will just swing in and state their problem with the factory tuner.  Mostly it just doesnt work, nothing coming out of the speakers and so forth.    I hardly charge for this, if we don't find a problem or can't help you in the right direction to solve the issue.   There is some cases tho where I will charge the lowest labor charge I can.   These cases usually involve a customer that is rude either before check-out or during.   Usually goes like this  Me-  "Sir, we went thru the radio checked all connections and fuses.  We couldn't find anything out of the ordinary, but I believe the radio could be shot internally."  Customer- "Well there better not be a charge, if you didn't fix anything.  Now I have to bring it to another shop to waste more of my time."  Me-  "Sir, I will have to charge you the min labor fee for having the car looked at."  *Customer throws a fit*  Now if you don't want to be charged, this is the response I'm looking for  Me- "Sir, we went thru the radio checked all connections and fuses.  We couldn't find anything out of the ordinary, but I believe the radio could be shot internally."   Customer- "That's unfortunate.   Anyway, what do I owe ya?!'  Me- " Oh, nothing but I recommend this [Dealership] or [junkyard] for a factory radio replacement."     Epcot    Ya not a monkey, but did you see the hippo bottom right?    nah   They also sell Hollaster- HOLLA!   So...Walkman?   use a piece of your hair   Hi Olivia!   But it does in a toaster!         Crap that curtain out of the photo and you got yourself an album cover    I too never liked that level on Mario64   vist:  metraonline.com   or    bestkits.com    to check what you will need -Dash kit- Harness - Antenna Adapt-  Next find what you are looking for in a radio.   If you need just CD-USB-AUX - you can find radios for right around or less $100  for example heres a good radio  http://www.crutchfield.com/p_113KDC155U/Kenwood-KDC-155U.html?showAll=N search=kdc_155u skipvs=T  Now for speakers!   The jeep should have 5.25 all around.  You are not limited to that size tho.   You can place 5.25 -  6.0 - 6.5  just needs adapters.  Now, since you have so many options this is where you will have to do some research.    I deal with JL Audio and RE audio and love both brands, but worked with  a lot of other companies  1. [High End](http://www.crutchfield.com/p_136TR600CX/JL-Audio-TR600-CXi.html?tp=105)  2. [Low End](http://www.crutchfield.com/p_500SPS510/Alpine-SPS-510.html?tp=105)  This should keep you right around the $400 price point without install of course.       Brock is Ironman?   But did you take the first photo?   THE FUCK THEY ARE!        The otter can also make an alligator play dead.    People would be more confident.    Stealing alligator souls.     I have an opportunity(foot in the door) chance on starting a career as an adjuster and was just wondering if anyone could give me insight on this.  1. How did you fall upon this career path? 2. General Pros and Cons? 3. Is it hard traveling to different locations? 4. How is it working with the general public 5. Any secrets I should know?

 Chris is a great guy and everything but Holy Fuck No am I paying $70 for jeans that look like you need tweezers to get anything out of the pockets.   White under shirt   This or the gel bleach so you can put it right on the stain.   Took the words right out of my head.   Unfortunately he's unable to do one anytime soon due to him still being in the air.          Damn it Ed Sheeran stop asking for money to build your LEGO house.   Hahahaha I know that reporter. He's on the local Fox station KTVI.    So..you'd recreate Ferguson?   "I remember when Eggman was going by Dr. Robotnic but then he went and changed his fuckin name without consulting me first."   Keep the phrase and redo the heads and you should be good.   OOH CAKE!  Oh and Happy Birthday Jack   Looks like she was pickpocketing the black dude.   Thank You   I have 3 white coats and by being a fat guy they make me look like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters.   I Have A Dream That One Day People Will Not Be Judged By The Color Of Their Chef Coat But By If They're A Complete Fuck Nut Or Not!!!   FUCK! I'll get bail.   Uh....she legal???   Used to have this game and it was awful. Compared to the original 2 it was one of those why was it even made games.      Had three I used to frequent and one became a bank, one got torn down and became an AT T store, and the last one became a car audio place called Audio Express.   Ooh damn. Yeah tetanus shots hurt like a mofo and just remembered I'm about due for another one.   Just got the All Clear.   Yep was trying to cross.   Police Scanner and was just on 2.   Hate to say it but them closing without giving the employees notice is common practice in the restaurant biz. With that said I used to eat at the Mid Rivers one all the time but in the past few years you could tell it was even open with all the trees around.   That Rupert with Paul on the cover?   Happened about 30 minutes ago. A woman was struck   killed, and the car that hit her ended up on the other side of the highway with someone running from the vehicle. As of right now it's an active crime scene with county crime tech in route.   Think of it as your run of the mill pub food i.e. wings, burgers, other fried food. It's basically Hooters with different uniforms.   If at all possible wear long sleeves. Don't have any ink (yet) myself but have seen some nice piece messed up from burns and whatnot.   Dude fit every aspect of mega douche.   Makes me want to go there and try it.   By far the best part of a Buffalo wing. Here have an upvote.   Well on the bright side the floor is cleaner than its ever been.   That's what we always used. Was much much easier.   Nope not the only one. Just a waste of time in there. I rather shower and get out.   Is it in a school zone?  Reason I ask is because we have them here and they're used to power the flashing lights at a school crossing.   Wouldn't it be some shit to do this one to find out the original is worth millions?   From how I understood the title her family got it off of eBay. So more than likely no refunds or exchanges.   Used to have one exactly like this when I was 7.   Got mine a month ago but a new cell phone with an 8MP rear camera and can take 1080P vid. Only reason for this phone is the old one bricked.

Just heard a call on the scanner yesterday that said respond to the leasing office they have some packages missing.   Name?   Having exact problem   Just played this morning no problem. Go to play now and can't invite   Wow just WOW! Now that Scott Trade logo is easily removable right if another change happens?   Walgreen's is open Christmas if you need ice of your head or your nuts.            I'd say more $450-$500. From the small pics the top and TV look good but the bottom looks beat to hell.   $1.25 + Free Shipping   That's like Walgreen's now has stickers on some products stating that it is only to be sold at Walgreen's.   Only hard drugs I ever did was Opium, popped adderall, and snorted xanex. Only one that really fucked with me was the opium but I was still with it enough to know wtf I was doing. Besides that it was weed and alcohol but don't really call that hard drugs.   Need one of these where I'm at. It's...it's...beautiful   You seem to have the passion and the drive to learn this trade. Being the bosses kid I can see where people might think you have a chip on your shoulder but I say screw em. Do this for you and you alone. For the pain working out and aleve helped a hell of a lot. Good luck with this.   Food looks good and I wouldn't mind trying some of those myself. Good Job   Thanks for saying this, it was the only one I had a problem with. Food looked good but the plating just looked like they used a dirty plate.   Besides knives sharpies just might be the 2nd most important as well as stolen tool in the kitchen. Mainly used for labeling things.   It means for the time being they're fucked to put it simply.   I'd be happy with a case of beer, box of sharpies, and socks.   No, not one ounce of creepy in that elf.   From reading that it sounds like the kitchen is in the weeds. On the other hand constantly nagging them to hurry up doesn't help the cause either.   Burns anytime over cuts.   *curls up into the fetal position and pretends he didn't read that*   Yeah I'm going to need to do this challenge.   Damn you caught me.

Can we talk about placing a new soccer stadium on top of it now?   *drops mic and walks away*   I'll take your fuck that duck fat suggestion and raise you bacon fat.   After the instruments start I can't even understand wtf she is saying.   Used to always take a rubber ball like a super ball and start putting rubber bands on that.   Wait there's a rose there?   Learn basic knife skills as well as how to hold the knife properly  Take notes lots and lots of notes  Big box of sharpies at home is a must   Respect such as YES CHEF NO CHEF  Don't be afraid to ask questions but not when someone is in deep shit   Aka someone too young to play the mother. Daughter or sister yes but Mother nope.   Blonde looks to be Chloe Foster but the other girl doesn't look familiar from that angle.   There's one in Overland/St. John area where a guy has a train track set up in his front yard and a hot chocolate stand in his driveway.  Then in Florissant off of Mullanphy behind the schnuck's there's a house that puts Clark Griswold to shame.   You might want to see a Doctor your ball is turning purple.   Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain Read it back in 03 and that's when I decided that this was the career I want.   Well to put it simple she's a bitch for one thing. Fucked the friend over by firing her trying to claim misconduct on set on friend's husband. Then ended up releasing the friend's last set for free so she wouldn't get any revenue from it. Also she'd bring her son to the studio and let him run all over during photo shoots.   I used to talk to her everyday and still friends with a girl that used to model for Nikki and from that I wouldn't touch Nikki with a 10ft stick.   That would be it.   The football faux rape scene.   Exactly. I've yet to see any ups worker in a bad mood   Their Market Fresh Sandwiches are good but I miss their Bronco Berry Sauce.   I had a white GBA but traded it in for a silver SP preorder. Had that exact GBC though. Got it for my 12th birthday back in 99.   Too many comments to see if this has been posted before but it says new account back again so something tells me she has been going at this for awhile.   Happened to me twice back in the day. Bought a game, came home and opened it, and I could see straight through the disc because it was so scratched up. Other time had the wrong game in it. Thankfully was able to exchange both of them.   Same here. I mean reslly if a chick broke it off with you would you say nice shit about her?   I 2nd the picatta and veal saltimbocca. Most definently a must and not hard at all to make.

 Mini crop circles   Hide it in my wife's junk drawer. Although it may never be found then. ;-p   I had a real shallow strainer a long time ago. It was almost more of a food strainer by look, but not design. There is no way it would have contained an expanding tea leaf, like many oolongs. The one I show an image of in this thread doesn't have that problem. Any well designed strainer should work fine with any mug design.   Unless you don't like the tea floating and not integrating as well or something, then your options are limited.   That sucks. I've lived in big city suburbia my whole life and I take some things for granted. I have to drive 25-35 minutes for good Chinese food, but there is bad to acceptable Chinese food all over.   My only time in the boonies is on fishing or hunting trips and we're packing everything in. Any carryout is 40-50 miles away.   My pleasure. You may want to try Earl Grey too. People either love it, or hate it. They also have a decent oolong. I drank Twinings for about 15 years. Hopefully you can find a few you really enjoy.   Here is my strainer. http://imgur.com/gallery/pAXdqu7   Edit: Here is my gaiwan with the built in strainer. http://imgur.com/gallery/BRg3jhY   I had Kliban calendar's for years and years.  I loved those cartoons.   my son who is a Chemical Engineer would love that as a tea/coffee mug. There is profit to be made by the person who sells these as mugs.   Have you tried asking any of your local Chinese restaurants if they sell their tea?  In our area, they will sell them and the price is very competitive for bag tea.   Twinings is readily available in the UK and they have both loose and bagged tea. They are fairly inexpensive teas. They have a lot of variety to find the flavors you like and they are easy to find.  I like their Darjeeling, Prince of Wales, Jasmine green and their gunpowder green.   Can you explain what makes the strainer useless for you?  I use my gaiwan, which has a built in strainer, for oolongs or trying new teas. At work I use a 500ml stainless cup with a stainless strainer for the tea. I then pour smaller cups into a porcelain tea cup so the tea in the travel mug stays hot longer, as I am not leaving it open for sipping all the time.   I was wondering the same thing. We had a teacher create ours in some HS class a lifetime ago. I don't hear much about them anymore.   I just found this: Each named variety of tea bush produces a fine and noble tea that is named after it, such as Da Hong Pao, Tie Lo Han, etc. This unique naming and identification happily provides yan cha fans with much to sample and discuss.  Laplap Hoa may be a big old tea bush.   I get tea from China and Taiwan too, but only because I cannot grow it myself or get in any grocery store. Like you can with orange and lemon peel, lavender, rose and carnation petals, etc. And it's not tea, but I get what you mean.   Hmm, time for a trip to IKEA. Those bags from Yunnan Sourcing take up a lot of space and my tins from Taiwan use more space than I need. I keep my tea in a cabinet so the clear jars don't worry me.   Thanks for sharing. They look like they'll hold about 75-100g's of leaf tea   Why on earth would you get some of those products from China? I expected to see some of their medicinal type stuff like you can get from a Chinese herbalist. Not stuff you can easily get yourself in a grocery store or from your garden.   Incredible for me to see this as I am having the same issue. Apparently I have a pinched nerve in C6 and C7. They're talking about all sorts of mean and nasty things to fix it. I've gone back to yoga and trying to get back into Tai Chi to loosen myself up. Surgery is not an option I want to consider. I have another appt Monday.   They have a test to see if it is nerve or something else. I think it was called an EMG.   If I use Google translate, my options are traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese. I believe it refers to the common language/character set used by the people in China. Yes, there are many sub languages in China. Could it be sort of like referencing Indian language, which is the Hindi shared across most of the people in India.   edit: Wiki page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language   Crystallization doesn't bother me. It makes it easier to measure. Some companies whip it, which integrates the crystals even better and it stays that way for longer. I live in Michigan. When I travel to tropical locations the honey gets very soft. But still not exactly pourable like store "honey".   Could it be the estate name?  If I saw Lingia Darjeeling in Hindi, I'd have no idea Lingia was the estate name. Trying to translate it would not work like laplap hoa doesn't.   Or even several names of teas in the native language. My tea strainer has the word tea in 6 languages along the rim.   http://www.wmfamericas.com/shop/tea-strainer   I don't prefer it or dislike it. It's just a fact when you buy real honey.   I guess it's like OJ. We want consistent flavor, but to get consistent flavor requires pasteurizing. What we really buy is neutered OJ with orange perfume added. Since the orange flavoring is made from oranges, it can still be called pure.   What we really prefer is the pure product, but that product has too short of a shelf life for big stores. So the stores compromise for us.   I didn't know that.  I've been to western India and southern India and all I have ever found there is regular black Darjeelings. Thanks for improving my knowledge of tea. I assumed oolong is sort of a special technique which is why I've only seen it from China and the surrounding Asian countries.   I wish.  IMO the bigger problem is Chinese honey with a lot of unhealthy and unlabeled stuff in it. Chinese honey comes in from all over the world. Currently Chinese honey has a 215% tariff on it, so they move it to a country without the restrictions and relabel it.   I use a metal electric tea pot to heat my water. A nice addition would be a temp gauge/thermometer on the outside. It would be a cheap addition and unique.   I pour it from there into a double wall 500ml stainless tea cup to keep the tea hot. I would consider a nice porcelain or ceramic one instead.   I use a WMF stainless steel strainer. It's simplicity and ability to keep clean is perfect. I do not see a way to improve it. You'd have to get into cute strainers for people looking beyond the functional imo.   I have several tea cups I use. I just got a new one I really like while I was in Vietnam. It has a nice unique design and you can tell it's not from a mass market company. Maybe hook up with a few artisans in Asia who make cups or maybe some pottery schools or studios in the US who would be interested in small run cups of different shapes and styles.   Edit: and avoid Chinese products. The quality of their inexpensive products is highly questionable. Even for Chinese. I prefer no lead in my cups, or unknown metals in steel products. China has major problems with both.   1st flush for regular drinking, 2nd flush for when I need something that bites a bit.  I've never seen anything but black Darjeeling, but since Darjeeling's a region not a type, it makes sense that you could find green unprocessed leaves too. It would surprise me if they were making oolongs though.   I agree about the raw honey. I actually went to tea partially to start getting honey in my diet. I have stomach problems and bad pollen allergies. Honey had a huge positive impact for both problems. Until I started using raw honey, I was struggling with the flavor.   I have never found raw honey that did not look and taste pure. Supposedly, the reason grocery store honey is heavily mixed and ultra purified, which takes all the health benefits away, is for shelf life, for that golden look and because most customers do not like their honey crystallizing, which real honey does. I doubt if the market for raw honey is big enough to get the Chinese imposters and large companies adulterating it. I believe almost all honey from the big corporate food groups is highly processed and at least mixed with foreign honey. Most foreign honey is not pure or has a lot of Chinese honey. Once you get into Chinese honey, you're into all sorts of metals and toxins mixed in, as well as non bee products.   I got mine from Amazon. I think I paid around 35 for a cast iron one that is a nice size. I've seen it in Duty free shops in Asia for a lot more. It has a nice porcelain inside to keep it clean.   It's called Old Dutch Cast Iron Saga Teapot, 52-Ounce   It would be kind of cool to have a calligrapher write the type of tea in the native language in a nice contrasting color. Sanskrit, Kanji, Chinese, etc   They are labeled as pure, when they are not. Olive oil has Canola and other oils added. Honey has corn syrup and what is called honeydew added, which is honey from insects other than bees. Like aphids.   I stop at Cracker Barrel for breakfast a lot when I am on the road. They use Dickinson honey's and jelly's. I like their jelly, but the honey tastes and smells like what you mention. Unless I have a super strong tea, that is the overwhelming flavor.   I was really bummed when I read about the olive oil.  The 2 brands I bought most often were both using canola oil mixed with olive oil. I thought I was buying from reputable companies and of course the label on all of them said "Pure olive oil".   For honey, I just didn't like the darker ones being mixed in as it made my honey smell and taste like molasses. That pushed me to the health food stores and farmers markets to get wildflower honey from local suppliers.    I find inexpensive Darjeelings get bitter fairly quick. But as others said, that is sort of the way people like their tea sometimes.  On my way back from Tokyo I had a breakfast tea when I woke up. I wanted that tannic, almost bitter flavor to wake up.   I prefer Yunnan teas most of the time and they are known for not getting bitter, even when over steeped.   When I got my first gaiwan in Taiwan, I talked to the owner about how to use it. He gave me some directions and said to make sure I leave the top off of it between steepings or the leaves scald. Also, as Sa Rart stated, I shake my strainer real well to get as much water out as I can.  Still, some teas handle a 2nd steeping better than others.  I've also found if I use my cast iron tea pot which is about 750ml, there is not much flavor left for a 2nd steeping. In small steepings like in a gaiwan, I can get 4-6 depending on the tea.   It may have more to do with how much tea you can make from your steeping, than how many times you can steep. 7 steepings of 100ml is almost the same as one of 750ml.   What are you basing your labeling on? Them saying it is honey does not mean it is honey. The FDA does not inspect honey.   It's like saying you get pure Olive oil because it is labeled as such. Labeling means little in the US. Olive oil and honey are 2 of the most mislabeled and adulterated products on the grocery shelf.   Honey and Olive Oil are 2 of the most mislabeled products in the US.   I should have specified in the US. The US FDA does not inspect honey. It is pretty much the wild west in labeling.   But in NYC there are real farmers markets on Long Island. It was more an example of how far and wide honey is produced now.  I guess the tundra regions are about the only place honey is not produced in quantity. Desert's, cities and almost everything between.   Ah yes, that is true. Even McDonalds in Canada is not too bad because of your meat standards.  Maybe finding specific honey for wildflower of orange blossom or something. If it is mixed honey's. it may have buckwheat honey which is almost like molasses imo.   Search about it. Most honey labeled as honey is in fact corn syrup or mixed with corn syrup or other sweeteners: This is directly from the USDA Rules and Regulations,  honey does not require official inspection in order to carry official USDA grade marksthere are no existing programs that require the official inspection and certification of honey   Where do you live that you can't get local honey? They even have beehives on roofs in NYC now. If nothing else, try Stakich honey, which you can get on Amazon. I find their honey to be excellent. It was local to SE Michigan, but I think they've gone national now. I used to buy cases of 6 - 5 lb containers to save on the cost.      Argentina is a major producer of tea, so like India, Taiwan, China, etc there are a lot of variations. I believe they focus on black teas. They planted seeds from India and China in the 20's.   Most honey sold in the US grocery stores is flavored corn syrup. The real mass market ones are typically mixed from several types. Some honey is disgusting imo and has an odd smell when it's heated. I like pure wildflower honey from local suppliers.   Try getting your honey from the local farmers market. I think you'll be surprised. The real dark honey's are rough imo.   Was it made in a normal tea cup or one of their cups with the straws? When I was there, most people drank mate. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_%28beverage%29   T2Tea Grand Yunnan http://www.t2tea.com/tea/black/grand-yunnan.html was the first tea that just blew my mind. The new crop did not grab me like it did for the last 3 years.   TWG's Yunnan Golden Needle is even more amazing but over double the price. https://www.twgtea.com/product/details?code=T617   I bounce around a lot with Yunnan Sourcing's Yunnans looking for something like either of the above. I haven't found a match, but http://yunnansourcing.com/en/yunnan-black-teas/3327-wu-liang-hong-mao-feng-yunnan-black-tea-spring-2015.html from last autumn is the tea I find myself drinking over and over.    Constant Comment is the only flavored tea I enjoy. It has a very nice flavor. And Twinings Darjeeling was the first Darjeeling I really liked.   Last time I was in Taiwan I bought tea from several shops. I had been looking forward to going back now that I knew which ones I really liked. Surprisingly all 3 teas I wanted to get again were in the same shop. (An Oriental Beauty, a heavily oxidized Tie Guan Yin and a Sun Moon Lake black tea) They had a 20 year old oolong that I decided to get too. Brewed western style it was more mellow than I expected. Tomorrow I'm going to try the gai wan and see if it develops more body   When I was in Singapore, they had a shop called TWG, which is sold in Harrod's in London.  Their Yunnan Gold Needle is one of the best teas I have had in my life.   All of my current teas, not bought on my overseas trips, is from Yunnan Sourcing. I am very happy with their quality. I really enjoy their High Mountain Red Ai Lao Mountain Black Tea. It reminds me of Sun Moon Lake's black teas from Taiwan.   I hope you find a tea or two you really like. Personally, I hate Earl and Lady Grey. They add bergamon to that and that taste overwhelms the tea for me. My favorite Twinings is Prince of Wales. It has a fantastic flavor imo.   I take a green pad to my stainless cup about once a month. I add baking soda and even vinegar if it is real bad. I don't even use soap on my gaiwan and tea cups. I rinse them with hot water, wash by hand and rinse again.   I read that we should add more tea if we want it stronger, not brew it longer.  I still try both methods. Each works, but I get better results depending on the tea I am using. I think green tea gets bitter if over brewed. I don't mind over brewed black teas though.   If English breakfast tea is weak to you, your limited on your options.  Irish breakfast is almost like drinking coffee to me.  Did Darjeeling come in your variety pack?  Twinings Darjeeling is a lot stronger than a high mountain estate Darjeeling.  If you want your tea really strong, pour the water directly over the tea bag just after it quits boiling. That will put hair on your chest then. ;-p   Edit: This advice is for black teas only. It will make oolongs and green teas bitter if you pour boiling water on it.   Everything I can find says Li Shan is oolong, but I have some that says Red Tea (Black tea for westerners) and it brews like a red/black tea. It's pretty nice but a lot like an Assam.   Has anyone else seen a black Li Shan tea? The company I got it from ahs both regular Li Shan and Red Li Shan.   Absolutely not.  We had our 2 kids and I was done. No rubbers ftw   Give your remaining time to help others. Cook in a soup kitchen, work in a 2nd harvest for food program, deliver food to the elderly and home ridden. You may find it gives your life purpose.    Commercialism is what the western life is about and it is an empty life, or like eating dorito's to fill you up. I really struggle finding meaning of life too and focusing on others, helps a lot.   I spent a few hours walking the old quarter this morning. Very cool area. Unfortunately I have a pinched nerve in my neck that is causing a lot of problems so I had to cut it short today.   	57

 Thanks for the info anyways. It sounds like a pretty great program.   Those scores are so easy to get though, how could they possibly afford to do that?

 it makes sense. kind like how suboxone works for me.   yeah i'm not expecting much from these but thought i might as well try them. my tolerance is about 60-80mg hydro   well it can't be worse coming off of than hydroodone?   ok for sure thanks!! what's the buzz like?   I probably can if i wanted to. i live in kinda a cutty place though.  I have a ton of suboxone and will eventually do the subs but for the time being i want to have a bit of fun and never tried tramadol.   ok cool. thanks for the heads up. i'm gonna start low obviously. not sure what mgs they will be prescribing me.    ah ok well i havent in the past.   fucking ehhh man!! i wish i was in your fucking shoes right now!! en fucking joy!!! haha sorry for all the swears but i had to emphasize my excitment!!    ok so if anyone has been somewhat following any of my recent posts, I basically was cut off from a 120 a month norco script that I was on for over a year. I was able to come to a comprimise with my doctor and she is going to give me ultram to help with my withdrawls.  what can i do with this stuff? i have avoided it in the past due to reading that it can cause gnarly seizsures.  should I take a chance on this stuff and is it any fun??   how much do norcos go for in your neck of the woods?  They just seem really hard to come by nowadays.   no problem hah   Haha swim is not necessary around here fyi   oh i know that. you would have to consum a lot of poppyseeds to test positive on a pee test.     I don't know why i got a bit worried when i ate a poppyseed bagel the night before a pee test. Nothing happened obviously but i just kept thinking about that Seinfeld episode haha   not bad, just desparate haha    i bet you are right. what is crazy is doc tried to start me on 8mg strips 2 times a day!! i stuck with 1 8mg strip a day.   hahahaha best story ever!! love it.   Yeah i guess so. Like i said first time for me on subs so i hope i didn't somehow blowout my opiate receptors lol   What i meant was that before subs 4 norcos would get me started good   Yep. I stopped at 10.  Its like  4 pills equal. 2 pills etc.  I can always take 4 and feel it nicely. I just don't want to waste my pills to not really achieve anything   I mran i can feel them but on day 3 still no warm euphoria like before the subs. I'm honestly getting kinda scared    8mgs for 5 days with no prior sub experience.  I feel the norcos but its like half as powerful as before subs   so i started on subs a week ago.  lasted a week but had a ton of norco so 2 days ago i took some.  i waited about 30 hours for it to be out of my system.  Problem is that its not hitting me the same as it did before I took subs.  I know the whole thing about the bupe blocking your opiate receptors and it could take a bit for real opiates to work.  Its now friday afternoon and i last dosed my subs at 11am tuesday.  Do I need to keep waiting or are my receptors just fried??  I hope I can still get somewhat high again.  I am a noob to subs but not to opiates.   jump in front of a car.  i am actually serious with that.  its going to be really hard to get any legit scripts from now on.   yep its coming down to it now where its really going to be hard unless you are a parapalegic or dying of cancer to get anything more than 30 5/500 vicodin.  i have posted a few things on this sub lately warning people after what happened to me about how hard its going to get but nobody really seems like that they want to believe that that is what is really going to happen.   same thing basically happened to me but i got completely cut off.  I had an appoinment yesterday with a "pain phychiratrist"  and she said that about 8-10 years ago it was fairly easy to get opiates prescribed from your doctor but in just the last year or 2 they have really been tightening up and its only going to be harder to get legal dope. she cited the obvious reasons - the DEA and all the dumbass famous people that couldnt handle their shit that is all in the media BUTTT  she also said that there have been recent studies showing that opiates do not really help for long term pain unless you are really old/have cancer its going to be near impossible and the fact that I am 32 not 62 makes it a lot harder for me to acquire those meds. that is basically what she told me.  She was really nice, straightforward and honest so I have no reason not to believe what she told me.   Yes me too. Let's hope that shit is true though.   If your insurance pays for your subs your doctor will probably find out  that is why i went somewhere else to get my subs   I just started on subs last week. Not through my insurance i went to a private clinic.  The lady said it would be confidential because of the HIPAA law   ok good to know. i'm just going to keep it up at least until my meeting on tuesday.  the doctor said he was giving me so much at first for cravings so you are correct.   i just started on subs this week too.  the doc wants me to take 2 8mg strips daily.  I thought that was overkill so i have been doing some experimenting on my dosages.  I am only 3 days in but i still feel nausea, headache and tired.  I hear that after 5 or so days this should go away? I feel like the side effects are outweighing the good effects.   thats the plan to wait as long as possible so i don't waste the pills.   haha it all depends on your tolerance. i remember when 2 norcos were nod time for me!!   Me too and I'm only on my third day haha. They have been great for withdrawals for sure though    I guess i am but it's not a good high.   i put myself on them.   Nausea. Headache.  Sleepy.  Basic side effects    headache, almost threw up, nausea.  basic side effects I guess.   yep i had crazy good self control for months when i was getting 120 norcos a month.  i kinda binged the last couple months though haha.   lol they gave me 16mg the 1st day!!. i'm on my 3rd day and taking maybe 4mg tops.  the subs seem to make me want my DOC less (norco) but the side effects are not fun.  apparently they should subside in several days??   sounds like a good plan!   thats kinda what i want to do haha. i'm about 2 days in.  i don't have the craving for my norcos like I used to but the side effects of the subs really suck!!   just started on subs but still have a stockpile of these.     i started up on subs about 2 days ago.   [IMG]http://i42.tinypic.com/14cw30y.jpg[/IMG]   I know but at the same time they are so relentless talking about DEA and Obamacare that I am not going to be able get through to these people meaning that I need to get out of this program totally.   "any doctor who knows anything about pain though will know that opioids are a fundamental part of any good pain management"   LOL tell that to the pain mgmt doctor that I was referred to!!!  he is the reason that I now have NO form of opiate medication when I had it prescribed for 4 years.       Well i took my first ever dose today.  I waited close to 30 hours since my last opiate.  The doctor wanted me to take a whole 8mg strip. I thought that was too much so i cut it in half and they had me sit in a room for a while then i took the second half.  To be honest i thought id either get really sick or really buzzed. Neither of those 2 have happened yet and its been over 2 hours.    awesome man thanks for the input!! i will keep you updated!    looks like something i left in my toilet this morning.   ok thanks. so at this point i don't get a euphoria any more with my habit. i do feel good though. what can I possibly expect from subs as far as how i feel on it? i know everyone's experience is different but how did the subs make you feel?    ok good to know. i am on the same page as you being that a small dose goes just as far as a large dose when it comes to subs.    ok cool. thanks for sharing. that is basically what i have found so far. I will tell the doctor on tuesday to be gentle haha. but he should know how much to give me because I will be doing an interview beforehand telling a person my habit/tolerance.  once again thanks again!! i am still a bit nervous to start on subs.   thanks! i will. like i said its a monkey on my back that i will always most likely have unless i have some kind of "crutch" like suboxone.  but fuck it. if subs work then that would be awesome.   meaning to give me just a tiny bit since the research that I have done so far leads me to believe that a small amount of sub goes a long way.    yes that is what i am going to tell them when they induce me.     so this week I am waving the white flag and going to try suboxone after having my doctor cut me off after prescribing me opiates for about 5 years.  I have been using around 10 norcos daily for the last 6 months.  I have heard people say that subs might be a bit too much for my habit but i really don't know what to do as I will soon be out of norcos with no script anymore.  both of my parents and a lot of my family have died from drugs so the addiction and craving is pretty instilled in me.  thinking subs might help with that.  thoughts?!?!  thanks!!   yep i fully agree with you that opiates should be used for depression. but i'm not holding my breath on that one haha.  that would be awesome though.  Well since I got cut off my plan on tuesday is to just put up the white flag and get on suboxone.  i am just sick and tired of playing the game with my doctor and sometimes going to the streets since my tolerance has gone up.  I got screwed but fuck it.  Just hope that people will take heed to my warning even if they are set up with a cushy doctor like I was.     lol for sure. do what you gotta do.     honestly I just wish they could prescribe opiates for depression!! I have been on Paxil for about 12 years and i feel like it does jack shit.  but the minute I take a pain pill i'm a new person.  and to top it off it does alleviate my physical pain as well when I can take all the ibuprofen in the world and that won't cut it.  I am definatly mentally and physically addicted to pain meds and have to qualms admitting that.  yes I am tired of playing the whole doctor game and i guess being cut off could be a good thing in the end for me possibly.  also the big head honcho pain doc doesn't even adhere to MRI's  he told me you take 10 normal people, MRI them and 9/10 will come back with some kind of damage.  This guy was a complete piece of fucking work.   dude not a problem at all. it takes a lot to offend me and trust me you didn't haha.  I have a tolerance now, obviously so when I take my meds I don't feel "high" just about normal.  I am i think about in the same boat as you where its a fine line between using them for what they are intended for or just strictly for recreation.  also I am not trying to scare you but i was in your exact doctor situation and it happened to me so I guess always have a back up plan if you plan on staying on opiates for a while.   I am going to try and get on MediCal. only problem is that I can't until the end of the year I think, January at the earliest.   Yes I do.  I have some pretty severe sports injuries to both of my ankles that do require surgery. at least that is what a podiatrist in my town told me when I visited him.  You can physically see how gnarled and distorted my feet are. I had an MRI done about 5 years ago and you could see the internal damage and I am sure that my ankles have just gotten worse since then.  I will admit though I love opiates and the way they make me feel, I am addicted. So maybe this is the wake up call I need to get off of them even though I have legit pain.   ok sounds like you are set up good!! that is nice. but just remember i had my same doc for 5 years. trusted her like family she would even hug me at the end of every appointment and tell me how i'm on of her favorites. I have sent her flowers, etc.  not trying to be a buzzkill whatsoever, just telling you to stay on your toes cause I really never thought it would happen to me in my situation.  I guess always have a back up plan?? haha i dunno.  I was trying to go about obtaining opiates the straight way and got stung in the end.   ok the only problem is that I have Kaiser insurance right now.  I can't just switch docs under my Kaiser insurance because any doctor working under Kaiser will see that it was recommended that I be cut off of my monthly script (120 norcos) so I don't think I could even stay with Kaiser.  I could try to change insurances and completely get out of Kaiser (which I plan on doing sooner or later) but in the time being paying out of pocket with no insurance is not going to be fun.  So I am just kind of stuck in a rough place because even if I tried to get new medical insurance today it still would take probably months for it to kick in. I live in California if that makes any difference.     so what are you doing about your situation now?   like i said they did mention the DEA too but yep its pretty shitty. I'm sure i'm not the first victim of this bullshit and definately not the last!! i am just warning everyone out there that this did happen to me and this is factual information that was relayed to me from the doctors I dealt with recently after going from 120 10/325 norcos a month to nothing.......  I wish it wasnt the truth but sadly it is.     Cannot agree with you more  brother!!!   I fully agree.  I feel like it was a way out or an excuse to cut me off   Thanks man!! I am just so fucking upset still though.  I trusted my doctor like family    Yeah its Kaiser  Northern California they are extremely nazish about opiates.  Look em up if you feel like it   I pretty much did and that is essentially what she said DEA. So yeah im over her and needed advice on a new doctor    jei do have mris. Ligaments and tendons wrecked to hell.  She specifically cut me off for the reasons i stated before.   She referred me to pain mgmt and their head doc said right off the bat no more narcotics.  My prescribing doctor is in love with this guy so the second he put in the recommendation she adhered.  All i really heard was a lot of talk about the DEA and obamacare. These are simply facts, shitty ones at that but that is what transpired that day.   "A real doctor writing prescriptions for legitimate reasons/patients has nothing to fear."   you would think, right!?!?!  especially a pain mgmt doctor right!??!?! not in my case sir, not in my case.     its all good. but the fact is that I got cut the fuck off and obamacare/dea was the chief excuse.   hopefully it's not as bad as we think it will be but you have been warned.   I guess we'll just have to wait.  these are facts and exactly what I was told by real doctors so it's just a head's up.  Even if the doctors I have been dealing with are using it as an excuse to cut me off even though I have never showed signs of drug seeking. I know I am not the first victim of this shit and it's probably gonna get worse.   yes I do.  at least persistant enough to have supposedly been prescribed what I was receiving for several years. funny thing is that I really never even pushed or asked for norcos- she just kind of kept upping it. i started on 5/500 vics.      and also. for people with legit opiate scripts like myself:  what do you plan on doing since the DEA and the whole ObamaCare thing is going to REALLY REALLY start fucking us over very soon???  I bring this up because that is what every doctor I have dealt with in the last 2 weeks has told me.  This shit is about to get fucking real I think.    Oh yeah. FUCK KAISER PERMANENTE!!! they are nazis.  if anyone here has them, do not take your chances if you are trying to get any kind of opiate!!!   In my last post I told everyone how i was cut off by my doctor.  I have been scripted 120 10/325s for about 2 years now. I am under Kaiser Permanente northern california. She has been wanting me to do the Kaiser pain program for about 8 months telling me how good the head doctor is and how much she respects him.  I thought ok if she is referring me to a pain program I should be set right?!?!  Big mistake.  It took me about 2 months just be seen but when I went to my appointment he walks in and immediately says you need to stop taking norco.  he then berates me for about 20 mins about how much pain he has had for the last 30 years and he only takes about 4 percocet a month.  anyways i knew that i was fucked when he said he wanted me cut off since my regular doc that prescribes me the norcos looks up to this guy.  After that i have my app with her and she is like yep, you are done.  Most fucked up thing is she told me verbally more than once that when I got into this pain program that they would "at least start me on some low dose oxycontin"  I cannot believe what dirty shit was pulled on me.  I have had the same primary doctor for over 5 years and she was basically family to me.  She would always hug me and tell me I was one of her favorites.  Anyways my question is, I am thinking of ditching Kaiser all together and trying to get onto something like Medical.  I have proof I have been scribed the norcos for several years.  How hard would it be to get a new doctor to carry over that script?  Is it worth trying?  It's not like i'm coming out of the blue asking for them so I would think I have a bit of an advantage but just want to know everyone's thoughts. THANKS!!!!!    thanks man. the reason why i brought up subs is that I aknowledge that i am physically and mentally addicted to opiates.The small amount of research that I have done leads me to believe that it helps with your mental cravings for opiate which I need to address. Even if i was to taper off the norcos that would work but would probably not do shit to stop me from craving them mentally.  I dunno though......   i just found it right after i submitted this post!! haha thanks. i need to pay more attention.    i have had withdrawls before when I had to stop taking a smaller dose in the past. it sucked but wasn't the end of the world.  Obamacare is what he is blaming this on.  I get 120 a month but I usually take up to 8 a day ( i know i know haha)  i went to suboxone.com and found several docs in my area.  i guess i will just call around tomorrow and tell them my situation and if its even logical to do?  i couldn't really find anything on the site that was specific about how much you take or what you take pertaining to if suboxone would help that.  I will admit that I am physically and mentally addicted though so I thought this could work. thanks for the input.    so I just found out today that my doctor who has had me on norco for the last 4 years wants to to quit cold turkey and is cutting me off. this really sucks but it's something I guess I have to deal with.  How do I go about obtaining a suboxone script and is this the best option to help me? I mentioned it to her and she kinda wrote me off, i don't think she was in a good mood.  I am on about 6-8 10mg Norcos.  thanks guys.     Anyone in the 530 area?  I have no connections here    how is the interaction with soma and hydrocodone?  yay or nay?    	85
 He was diagnosed 1 month ago and given anti-depressants after feeling low for a few months (which has been happening now and then for four years but he has never been to the doctors). When he was diagnosed he told me he needed space to sort his head out and for me to not talk to him for a few weeks, no-contact.  I obliged and after 1 week he said he didn't like the thought of me being upset and it was all he could focus on so we decided to start texting again and he came and saw me, but he said he didn't know if he wanted to see me again for a while.   I then saw him that weekend for about two hours, and have seen him once a week since then usually for a night and a few hours the next day. He actually seems completely normal and happy when I have seen him which is nice.  I am not seeing him throughout the week, and he has not come round to see my family I have gone to see his. He has forgotten our anniversary and I gave him a card but he didn't get me one or offer to pay for the dinner (something he would usually offer on our anniversary)  I feel constantly on edge and nervous he's going to stop speaking to me or going to decide he can't see me. I think I'm having a hard time thinking that the depression has caused the way he has been acting because when I see him he is normal and excited about his job and just not different.  We haven't had sex for about 7 weeks because of the depression and now the anti-depressants have taken away his sex-drive. When we do see eachother we cuddle and it's nice but it's not the same intimacy.  I am really struggling with knowing what to do, I miss him and feel so lonely even though he is in my life and I have have such high anxiety levels at the minute.   This all may sound selfish but it's just hit me how down I have been for the last month doing everything on his terms and praying he feels better and wants me in his life.  	1
 I really don't know looking back on it, regret not keeping him sometimes, but I'm glad he found a good home though.    We actually had a really hard time letting him go, surprised we didn't keep him   He got adopted and is in a good home       Blue Moon      I was trying to throw it from the sink behind my back into the trash can and it miraculously landed up there, horrible shot.

 I watched a documentary a while ago which was about 100+ year old japanese people and they were all interacting with little kids,  like running races with them and playing games, they said it helped keep them 'young'. It was only a small community but they were one of the happiest groups of people in japan.     I'm 100% sure that they are   Dipped in peanut butter   You do it.  I'm too poor. But then share the treats with me   The wild birds like this wake me up every morning yelling the same kind of nonsense.     Ive always done it when i have a cough and trying to sleep. It's magic i think.     Oooh wow!  You lost like 20 years.    Its edgy. I'll sell my art for hundreds on etsy   Sadly yes.   She even tried to argue with me when i pointed out that the turbines were built on top of hills that were formed by fault lines which cause the tremors.  She was still certain that the government is trying to kill us.    Most of my dreams are equally strange.  Last night I was taking a train through canada with three jack russel puppies and was photographing canadas wild koalas.    Wind turbines cause earth tremors     Why is my bf stealing my eggs? Maybe i want to keep them and use them for crafts or something. Geez.    I refer to my nephews as turd-burger, jabberwocky, henny penny and my neice is bum face.   I love them.     Also people are more open about and accepting of mental and physical disorders now, we don't pretend the disabled don't exist and hide them away.     There's a difference between having something in your mouth and having something in your blood stream.     aw, poor kitty, and poor little Ryilee.   This isn't funny, this is a heart wrenching story.

Once I got my best to do a trigonometry test for me in high school so I wouldn't fail   weird, never seen that. In australia it comes in either cardboard cartons or plastic jugs.    They're my cousins, she raises them after they've been orphaned.    yessss! just in time for valentines day!   Well, I have a big girly crush on Bill Nighy, he's brilliant, but he is 40 years older than me.    I dont think it's shady, people swap doctors etc. all the time for lots of different reasons.   It does make sense, that we haven't adapted to this high pressure, academic kind of lifestyle, which is why I think a psychologist would be useful to see, because it is stressful and discouraging at times. But on the other hand, if you do have ADHD, medications really really do help. But some people don't take medication for it and work on other calming and focusing techniques.   Do a bit of research and read through other threads on this subreddit for ideas of how to deal with studying, and work out what you think will be best for you.   It is a pretty confusing situation, with the different opinions on ADHD out there. I honestly didn't really think it was real until I was diagnosed and saw improvements in my studies on medication.      Oh.. no... but I want to knock it.    you can tell a lot about a person by what they throw out.    defenatly this   one time I was travelling alone in the USA (I'm Australian), I was in a motel and there was this pretty overweight guy playing cards on his own, there was no one else around, he asked me to join him. We played cards for a few hours, then went our separate ways. This was 6 years ago, but I still think about how wonderful that guy was, he was beautiful.    except the people who are jerks and don't deserve respect.   But I like what you're saying a lot. I would like that better too.     any mac   cheese with ketchup    simmered in a rich, spicy dark gravy of pig blood  pass   oh wow, thats expensive. Sorry it didn't go as planned.   I'm not exactly sure what you should do. Maybe try a psychologist but keep searching for a better psychiatrist. It's excellent that you got the referral and the appointment so easily though, maybe you will be equally lucky in the future.   I just did a quick google search, and it looks like there are quite a few psychiatrists in brisbane who specialise in adult adhd. Write up a list of names of any close to you and take that to your doctor.   it might be due to the oil left from your hands that dust and dirt settles on and sticks to.    probably because their minds are crowded with other every-day thoughts.    let me know how it goes, if you like. And you're welcome, it's always useful to have someone to talk to.    yeah, demand that referral, it really sounds like you need it.   It sounds exactly like what I go through, the coloured notes, taking for ever to get work done and being too alert of my surroundings. exactly the same. so annoying.   I didn't research drugs much, but my psychiatrist did give me some information sheets on the different ones available. its excellent that you've been researching it, I think it really shows that you're taking this seriously, I hope you doctor sees that.   I think it's a good idea to take in your uni work, you might not need to show it, but it's good to have 'evidence', i dont think it will work against you.   Good luck with your doctors appointment. :)   my psychiatrist gave me a few options for medication, but I only recognised dex, so i chose it just because of that and he didn't have anything bad to say about it.   I know how you feel, about putting so much effort in to everything, it gets really tiring, it's not fun at all.  I'm not sure if psychologists can give referrals or not, sorry. But my psychiatrist recommended I see a psychologist as well as take the medication. I only had one appointment though, I wish I'd stuck with it, but I just couldn't be bothered I think. it wouldn't be a bad idea to look into seeing a psychologist too, and I believe you get 10 free sessions a year.   Just be honest with your doctor, and be demanding if you have to.    you're welcome   and the dog'z' doesn't help.    http://www.dogzonline.com.au/ this seems to have responsible, respected breeders. I was looking for dalmatians for my parents last year (didn't end up getting one), but I found this to be the best website for looking.    I used to always check the time at 10:03 am, not intentionally, it just always seemed to happen.    who doesnt want their own itteh bitteh kitteh committeh?    once my cousin, when he was about 4 (i think) sleepwalked into the kitchen, got a sharp knife, cut his tongue, went back to bed.    Back in nineteen-dickety-doo, my great grandfathers family died of starvation trying to Makens meat. RIP, you brave souls.    they don't exist   I'd suggest you start looking now, and try and find one that will specialise in ADHD, when I was searching I found that there were quite a few around so hopefully you don't have any difficulties with that. It's just that some don't believe in ADHD for whatever reason, my cousin sees one who doesn't believe in it, but she lives rurally so has no other options, he's very rude and condescending.   The dosage and type of medication will vary. I chose dexamphetamine, and my psychiatrist recommended I start on 20mg a day and then increased it to 25 after a while. It will depend on your body and how severe your possible ADHD appears.    All of the above, anything that has a significant positive or negative affect on a lot of people and is 'news worthy ',  just without all the fear mongering,  the dramatization, the appeal to emotions, the propaganda, i just want the facts,  i don't want to be told how to feel about it.     The plain, simple,  facts.   I'm in Adelaide, and the long wait seems pretty standard, between 1-4 months so you might get lucky.  And the script is for 6 months but you only usually get 1 or 2 months worth of drugs at a time.   Due to hormonal and physical changes in pregnancy    Yep,  the script is for 6 months worth of medication. the wait for psychiatrists is generally a few months, it was three months between getting my referral and having my first appointment.  I'd recommend you get onto it soon because it's likely you'll have a long wait also.   Try not to worry about what other people think. This is your life and you have to do what's best for you,  its hard not feeling good enough,  constantly failing or struggling. Get to a psychiatrist asap, and even if it turns out you don't have adhd, I'm sure they will be able to help you in other ways.     it's probably different with different psychiatrists, but my first appointment was 1 hour, where he got me to answer a bunch of questions, then we discussed my family history, my personal/social/student life and such. when he had determined that I indeed did have ADHD, he told me about the different medications and therapies available. He recommended that I go on medication because it was really affecting me, i was failing uni classes, so I chose to go on dex, just because I'd heard about it before.   the appointments after that were only half hour ones, where he asked for an update, gave me my new prescription, then we talked politics until the time was up.   I thought it was good that he gave me option other than medications, but that he recommended that I take them.      I think it's fine, and it is what I did. Doctors are there to help everyone. You are hopefully just over-thinking this and it will actually be a very simple process getting into a psychiatrist.   It sucks that there are those people out there who ruin things for others, but hopefully medical professionals can tell the honest ones from the liars.   Also, my psychiatrist charged $70 and my appointments were every six months, so it was pretty affordable, but I was getting youth allowance and had a centrelink health care card for the medication discount (something like $5 down from $30) - if any of that helps.   Explain everything to your doctor if you feel the need, or if she asks, like your mother not believing in it, having to save up, be honest and open about how your studies are affected.     I'm Australian too. If you're really concerned about being judged, you can say it's for your mental health in general. University can be very stressful even without additional difficulties with ADHD. If you aren't lying to get your referral, I suppose it doesnt matter which one you go with.   Also, I looked up psychiatrists in my area that dealth with ADHD, as some wont, or don't think it exists. important to find someone who will listen to you.   Although, if your doctor is half decent she shouldn't be judging your reasons for seeking a psychiatrist.    I want a monkey hug. what a cute little kid.    I'll wait until your future AMA, so I don't feel like a weirdo PMing you a long list of questions. :D   thats weird that they have a weight limit, dogs can be good or bad behaved no matter what their size.  Glad you got to keep your dog, I would hate to have to give up a pet due to housing, it would be heartbreaking.    I'm not an expert at all, but I would say it's definitely worth getting checked out.   I worried about that too, people assuming I just want drugs, but my psychiatrist asked me a lot of question, about family history and everything, and I suppose I could lie about everything, but he seemed certain that I had ADHD and thought it was unfortunate that I hadnt got diagnosed earlier, because I really fell behind in school. He then told me that dexamphetamines can sell for up to $10 per 5mg, which seems like a lot, but I didnt find out.   I would tell your doctor that you believe you have ADHD, maybe do a few online tests (I know they are diagnostic, but there are pretty accurate ones out there) and take the results in, I did that and the doctor agreed that I should be checked by a psychiatrist.    oh wow! I can't even imagine what that must be like. was it hard to accept? You should do an AMA, i could ask you a million things.     You sound a lot like me, very very similar problems. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 23 after suspecting it for a few years.   I think you should tell your doctor that you want a referral, not ask her, but straight up tell her. She can't refuse to.   But also ask her about ways to help your memory and organisation, because learning those things is really important to, and she might have some good techniques that can help.    I want a dog. worst part about renting.    what did you have amputated? why? I always feel awkward around amputees, not that I see them often, but I am curious and want to look, but don't want to offend them by staring. I never think anything negative about it, only curiosity.    So brave!    I always understood it to be because 'she' carries life. As in a womb.   Oh gosh,  that's horrible.

Hi all,  One of my fb friends has discovered one of her flying foxes had been stolen from a locked cage in her yard.  If anyone knows anything contact fauna rescue and the police.   She rescues and rehabilitates flying foxes that are orphaned or injured, many came into her care during the last heat wave.  She cares a great deal about each one.      Even Adelaidians and rural south Australians have slightly different accents.    Some places will experience colder weather than usual while others will experience hotter than usual, but on average the temperature will be hotter by 1 degree.  Its the severity of the weather that is the concern, more extreme weather that is causing the rise in temperature.     Some sharks do rest on the sea floor or in a shelter of some kind while others, like the great white,  need to continue swimming    Because the liberals gave labor hell for changing leaders, they can't just go and do the same thing a few years later.

 Wow..  Amazing how fast it can move when everyone has the correct info, LOL..  Just showed up in the FCC ULS!!  KK6SFZ  Napa, California.

His response to me was "I have no idea whats going on, let me know when it shows up" ? I don't want to talk bad about the guy, I know they're all volunteers and giving up their own time to help promote the amateur radio hobby, but I was hoping for a little more help than that from him.  I'm wondering if I should contact the ARRL VEC via email directly? (vec@arrl) The club I tested at is an ARRL affiliate.    Im unsure where to go next, or if I should do anything at all at this point, but I guess I have a weird story.

FORTRAN: You shoot yourself in every toe, slowly, one by one,   until all toes are used up. Then you read the next foot and   repeat the process. You will continue, even though you have   used up all the ammunition, because there's no routine for   exception handling.        PL/I: You use up all the system resources including the   off-line ammunition. DP and personnel management double their size, triple their budgets, buy four new mainframes and let the  old one drop on your foot.   Pascal: The compiler won't let you shoot yourself in the foot.     Forth:  You shoot yourself through both feet with a single bullet since you are standing with one foot on top of the other.  Algol: You shoot yourself in the foot with a musket. The musket  is fascinating in aesthetic respects and the wound confuses the   young nurse in the first-aid room.        Modula-2: After discovering that you will never ever be able to   manage anything in this language you shoot yourself in the head.     Ada: If you're stupid enough to engage in this language the US   ministry of defense will kidnap you, put you in front of an   execution squad and command: Shoot at his feet!       C++: You incidentally create a dozen instances of yourself and   shoot all of them in the foot.  First aid isn't possible, as it   cannot be decided which instances are bit-accurate copies and which  only point to other ones: "Over there that's me."        Smalltalk: You are spending so much time playing with the graphics  and the windowing system, that your boss will shoot you in the foot,  take away your work station and has you coding Cobol on a   character-based terminal.        Lisp: You will shoot into the accessory, which holds the gun, that   you are using to shoot into the accessory....      Prolog: You try to shoot yourself in the foot, but the bullet,   which misses the target, ricochets into the gun which explodes in your face.      Visual Basic: You pay Microsoft an inordinate amount of money, then   they put a control right there on the button bar that shoots you in the foot.  If you don't like the implementation, fine - shoot your foot in  another language. But don't forget to buy WIN 2000 first.  Assembler You put the bullet over your foot and drive it in to the instep with a hammer.   Javascript You attach the bullet to every shoe and it fires into the foot as you tie the shoestring.  Java You attach the gun to every shoe.  When you tie the shoestring, it goes and gets a bullet and fires it into your foot.  You also can get athletes foot using Java.  BC You fire bullets into your foot of any arbitrary length and any cross section.  Best used for bullets that are several feet long.       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt9zSfinwFA   At that price it better come with a whistle built in.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt9zSfinwFA   And trees.

 So there is a show (albeit a stupid one) that I don't remember the name of. Now, I was young at the time, so I was scared of pretty much anything. Anyway, I was browsing through the TV show list, and I saw that show on the list (called "haunted" or something). I knew it would be scary (yes, I could read at the time) so I asked my mom if I could watch this. Now, she was in the shower at the time, at the other side of the house, so she thought I said "Hunting", so she told me I could watch it. (Hunting is also inappropriate for kids, but OK mom.) I watched it, and it was something stupid about fairies, but I got spooked. The next day, I went to s-c-h-o-o-l. SUCH A FUN EXPERIENCE! I was afraid to go to the bathroom, cuz everyone knows those darn fairies will get you if you're alone in a bathroom, so I peed in a bush when no one was looking. That bathroom thing went away after a couple of days, but I was still scared of the dark for a long time. TL;DR: I got spooked by scary fairies, had to piss in bushes.

    The burning coughs of a young girl paralyzed with curiosity, aching to try something against her parent's wishes; the slow, dreamlike laughs emanating from the teen boy who finds humor and life in everything around him; the hushed, anxious steps and surreptitious puffs of a middle-aged man with children who must cloak his hobbies from a disapproving wife; an aging woman, kidnapped from the outside world by her pain, forced to live out her years in bedrest, who turns to the only medicine that truly relieves the pain. Four people, on opposite ends of the world, living completely isolated from the other. But, the world lies beneath a regal web of networks. These four people are not connected by the job web, the family web, the friend web, or the community web - they aren't even connected by the race or culture web. In some sort of joke played on us by the universe, they are connected by a leaf.            	5
 Agreed. No one wants games where you just wander around and explore. 'Journey' is a perfect example--no one bought that piece of crap.   This is certainly true. If you have a group of people willing to work with the game and fill in some gaps, even the 2004 version is worthwhile. I'd just hate to see people shell out $100+ for the old version, thinking they'd be getting the best version.   For those who haven't played it yet, it is certainly SOTW material. And GOTY material. Guys and gals, play this game!   Andrew Reiner gave some pretty poor advice regarding Betrayal at House on the Hill this week, so I'm offering this PSA to those interested in the game. There are two different versions of the game available, as indicated in the episode, but they are not quite as different as Andrew suggested (or, at least, not different in the way he suggests).  The original version of the game was released in 2004, by Avalon Hill, and the reprint of the game was published by Avalon Hill in 2010. The component quality of the 2010 version was subpar (in particular, the room tiles), which caused a lot of complaints. Subsequently, the 2010 version was reprinted with improved component quality. While the 2004 version probably has the best component quality of the bunch, it is not significantly better than the newer 2010 copies. It is certainly not worth paying exorbitant prices to buy the original 2004 version--especially since everything else about the 2010 version is superior.  The game involves exploring a mansion together, building the map as you go, and eventually triggering some event that causes one of the players to betray the others. At that point, there are two books that must be referenced describing the "Haunt" that the players are engaged in. The Haunt will give win conditions to each side, and the two sides consult their books separately because the details regarding these win conditions and other competitive game elements are typically kept secret.  In theory, it's a great idea, and sometimes, if the stars are right, it works pretty well. Most of the time, though, it's kind of a big train wreck--especially in the 2004 version of the game. When initially published, the Haunt books were riddled with errors and rules issues that made many of the Haunts difficult to understand (at best) or unplayable (at worst). We're talking references to rooms and game components that don't exist, or instructions that left both sides with no idea of what to do or how to progress the game. It was a hot mess.   To his credit, the designer spent a significant amount of time addressing these errors, and there is substantial errata available for the original printing. In fact, he self-published new versions of both Haunt books online at one point, when it didn't look like the game would ever be reprinted.   Luckily, the 2010 version incorporates all of those changes, and as a result it is by far the better version of the game. Please don't take Andrew's advice and spend the money necessary to track down the 2004 version . The newest copies available are the best the game has ever been, even with slightly lower component quality.   According to the IGN preview, it has its share of torture porn.   I'd love it if they could tighten up the exploration controls. I like to grab everything I see, but it's a PiTA since the game doesn't seem to recognize pressing the 'x' button unless Geralt is standing still. Being able to pick up things while walking would speed up the process so much.      All things in moderation. You'd have to work pretty hard to make a single serving of eggs benedict 1000+ calories. And the same can be said for most any dish--if you work at it, you can make it really unhealthy.  The worst offender for EB is the hollandaise sauce. A pretty standard recipe is 4 egg yolks, 1 stick of butter, lemon juice to taste (+ salt, pepper, maybe cayenne, maybe mustard powder). That's about 1,000 calories, but will easily serve 6-8 people. English muffins are negligible, as is canadian bacon, and the eggs are no more unhealthy in this preparation than in any other (which is to say, some people need to watch how many they eat, but 1-2 eggs a couple times a week for breakfast is far from unhealthy).   Total calories for a plate of EB, using the recipe above and assuming two eggs, is ~450. Total fat ~20 grams. It's certainly not the most healthy thing you can eat for breakfast, but it's not "very, very, very unhealthy."   Heard of pasteurized eggs?   The article title is 100% non sequitur. The only thing the article offers is unsupported conjecture that cable-cutters don't want to watch reality TV. There is no basis whatsoever provided for the concept that streaming services are "killing" reality TV.    I wouldn't say it's stupid. If you had $60 and you wanted to take a chance, what's the issue? I've done it plenty of times--even when I just want to take my family to the movies.  My point was I'd hardly call it a "fine." It's a calculated gamble, and there is nothing punitive about it.   I imagine so, yeah.   You could be right. But, a) I think the difficulty of BB is way overblown; and b) I think difficulty is not the only factor behind people "not getting into" games. If we were to weigh all the different factors against one another, I bet the percentage of people who get minimal value out of blockbuster games would be about the same (for a variety of different reasons).  Also, c) there was a point in time when most games *did* kill you over and over. It's not that unusual.   Heh. I'm the exact opposite, which is interesting (different strokes, right?). I have added RC Bray to my list of narrators to avoid.  	14

       I first remember hearing it in the first Transformers movie. I think it was when some scorpion robot came out of the dessert and sent out an EMP or something.

I just didn't want to force anything into the original theory that I couldn't explain using evidence from the books or movies.    audiences want some levity in their superheroes  The ones who religiously watch Marvel movies do. Nolan's trilogy was hugely popular and did ridiculous box office numbers, and although opinions vary, Man of Steel did very well for itself too.  It's okay if Marvel and DC have different approaches; they both have their audience.  I would also expect that some of their movies, like The Flash, will be a little lighter in tone.   Oh, wow. You saw all 25 of these movies that haven't been made yet and determined not one of them is good? Amazing.   You might be right about Suicide Squad; it has been bringing out a lot of mixed opinions. From what I've seen online, a lot of people have already made up their minds to hate it.   That's neither here nor there, though. WB isn't counting on Suicide Squad to break box office records; that's what Batman/Superman is for, and *that's* the movie that opens the flood gates for Justice League, Cyborg, The Flash, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, etc.  Suicide Squad can flop all day. It won't be the first or last WB movie to do so.   It could be causally mentioned or never brought up at all.  Any thinking audience member will assume they're either step-related or one is adopted.     what if Christmas in Whoville is in celebration of Horton saving them? Horton could be their equivalent of a christ figure in our world.  I was actually thinking of going there because there's not even a slight reference to Jesus or anything Christian in the Grinch book or the movies, but the timing wouldn't make sense.  Horton Hears a Who! takes place from May 15th-16th and Christmas in Whoville is definitely in the winter. Assuming their holiday would be on the anniversary of their contact with the outside world, it should be May 16th, late spring.   You're confused by adoption and think black people are "edgy."  I don't even know where to begin...    50+ years of history  They aren't making a movie with 50 years of history, nor are they relying on the average movie-goer to know 50 years of history. They're making a movie based on a thing. That is all.   Guardians of the Galaxy 2: Logically the Same Soundtrack   I get the joke, but DC Comics officially changed the character's name to SHAZAM! from Captain Marvel to avoid confusion.  It is kind of wonderful those are coming out back-to-back. I love coincidences like this.   In The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, the eponymous character is motivated to end Christmas because he cannot bear the noise made by the Whos in Whoville. Their traditions involve making an incredible amount of noise.  In Horton Hear a Who, we learn that the Whos are tiny people-like creatures living on a dust speck which Horton takes upon himself to protect. When he almost fails and the Whos are threatened with having their whole world boiled in Beezlenut oil, Horton encourages them all to make noise so that they sour kangaroo can hear them and confirm their existence.  Whos associate collective loud noise making with their triumph and survival in their darkest hour.  **EDIT**: This theory is based on the two books referenced and not the four movies (two each) based on the books.   You're absolutely right; I've known racists of every race and for a variety of reasons/motivations.   It's not like white people have some copyright on hate.   [It's okay to not like things; just don't be a dick about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0la5DBtOVNI)  And you weren't being a dick about it.   Everyone has genres they don't like; no need for excuses. Personally, I can't get into fantasy. If it has elves, goblins, dragons, wizards, etc., you've lost my interest.   No one is shitting on your opinions, nor is anyone offended by your taste in books. I'm merely pointing out that run-on sentences by Bradbury are hardly unique in literature and that there are worse offenders. I'd caution you against writing off literature on any such basis. You'd be losing a lot.    I'm reasonably sure you've answered the question. Unless anyone intelligently disputes this in the next 12 hours or so, I'll make it as "explained" and move along. Thank you.    If you prefer restriction, you are conservative. If you prefer freedom, you are liberal.  So you're saying liberals don't want "restriction" and conservatives don't want "freedom?"  That doesn't sound right. And what do you mean by "restriction?"  ___wing refers to your preferred level of government involvement. Right is a lot, left is none.  I'm pretty sure it's the opposite. Right-wingers are the ones always advocating for less government while lefties seem to generally believe in more government programs, or at least better-funded ones.   Appreciate it, but you're not actually explaining the difference; you're just saying that there is one.   Can you provide examples? I've literally heard Bernie Sanders alone referred to as a Democrat, liberal, left-winger, *and* socialist. Does he just happen to be all four, or could someone be one and not the others or even three but not the fourth?   Yeah, I love Billy Tucci in general and this artwork in general, but I'm not getting anything "steampunk" here.      It's a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.

Not every iteration of Batman was going for the level of realism that the Nolan trilogy was, nor did every iteration of Batman have zero knee cartilage and a broken back. In fact, the only other iteration of Batman who had his back broken is the DC Comics version. He's still active because he's also died and come back. Comics don't even try to make sense.

If climate change is real, largely man-made, and reversible, the opposition funding climate change denial is profit motivated because whatever they're selling--fossil fuels, etc.--is the leading cause of the problem.  The other side--solar panel producers, the makers of windmills, etc.--have a profit motive, which is to sell things that reduce carbon emissions and thereby reduce pollution.  I get *their* motivations, but what sensible person prefers we continue to burn fossil fuels, produce carbon emissions, and continue to pollute at reckless levels? What's the downside to reducing pollution?   I agree. I wasn't saying it shouldn't be included; I just feel it's necessary to point out that it's a satire of dystopian novels, not a true dystopian novel in and of itself, i.e., it's not meant to be taken seriously as 1984, Fahrenheit, etc. are.   I don't know about most parents, but I personally find Pinky Pie to be the most annoying character on the show.    It can vary a bit  You just summed up all of psychology.

"Did you learn anything from the anal probing?"  "Yeah. We learned that they didn't like it. I did, though."   How?   I just ctrl+f'ed to make sure someone did.   Truth be told, this is the first gif I've ever made, so it's safe to say I have no idea what I'm doing. I googled it and makeagif.com came up.   Makeagif.com gives you five seconds. It was either cut out the bump or cut out the basketball off the dome. I made my choice and I stand by it.   There are elements of all three throughout the world to be sure. Huxley got it right in that indoctrination and making the slaves happy to be slaves is the superior way to achieve domination.   Orwell got it right in that surveillance, control of media, information, history, and ideas through propaganda works.  Bradbury was the one who determined that we'd embrace the oppressor. We'd gleefully surrender our rights and that entertainment would be such a welcome distraction that we'd completely miss the important stuff.   I like all those books, but it should be noted that Harrison Bergeron is a satirical sendup of the dystopian novel rather than one purely in and of itself.   If you find stock pictures of people and add the text over the pictures in sequence so it reads like a comic strip I can almost guarantee a huge hit.   You'd hate Faulkner.  Or Proust.  Or Dickens.  Christ, I could go on all day. These are great authors, not sixth graders turning in an essay on their summer vacations.   Besides maybe Animal Farm, The Scarlet Letter, and Huckleberry Finn, I can scarcely imagine an easier book on which to write an essay.   To each their own, but I prefer a book with sparse details. I have an imagination; let me use it. I don't need the description of the wallpaper, curtains, or what clutter occupies the coffee table unless any of it is at all relevant to the plot.   That's a far better thing than ending not soon enough and leaving you wanting less.   You're certainly entitled to your feelings/reactions, but I can't even begin to guess at the sheer wealth of art that you are denying yourself if a man smacking his wife prevents you from even finishing a thing.   There is no "be all/end all" of dystopian fiction, but, by all means, contribute other, better works. It adds much more to the conversation than a snarky comment and blanket dismissal of the opinions of roughly 4,823,408 people.   Out of Bradbury, Orwell, and Huxley, I'd say Bradbury's vision of the future in Fahrenheit 451 hits much closer to the mark than the others.   To add to this, check out this experiment by [The Naked Scientists](http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/experiments/exp/does-a-mint-make-your-mouth-cold).   I'm not sure what you're asking.  He's not a member of the team Suicide Squad/Task Force X, but he does have a least a cameo appearance in the film.  From what I've read, he's likely only part of a flashback sequence, but I don't have any 100% confirmation on that.   To be fair, [William Golding didn't like Lord of the Flies either.](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/05/william-golding-john-carey-review)  But I did.

How could I have possibly known?             The news has been covering the dire situation of dwindling bee populations for a while now. Can I be a beekeeper? Is there anything at all I can do to help the bees?   I was recently asked to do a Wally West   Bart Allen one, so here that is for anyone curious:  Sure, and The Flash extended family goes even beyond that, but Wally   Bart should be easy enough.  Wally West goes way back to 1959. There was a very powerful trend in DC Comics to give their marque superheroes a child sidekick, and The Flash was no exception, so [Wally West was introduced as "Kid Flash."](http://i.imgur.com/OowRBRA.jpg)   Barry was dating Iris West at the time and Wally was her nephew. As if the costume isn't unoriginal enough, he got his powers because the exact same accident that gave Barry his powers happened to Wally.  Barry sacrificed himself in the Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1986. Wally gave up the Kid Flash moniker and replaced The Flash, but this was also a way for the editorial staff to nerf the character a bit, as he had become OP as fuck over the years. He could no longer go faster-than-light, but rather the speed of sound and sometimes a bit beyond, much like our CW Barry.   Wally eventually came across Reverse-Flash (Eobard Thawne) and had to up his game, so OPAF Flash returned because he had to match Eobard's speed. Sometime during the 90s, the concept of "Speed Force" was introduced by Mark Waid, which became the go-to explanation of expanded powers and general fuckery that couldn't otherwise be made sense of. With the variety set of new powers, Speed Force as a way of explaining anything, and the ability to go faster-than-light, it has been argued by some, quite logically, that The Flash is actually more powerful and more OP than Superman.  As of the Flashpoint/New 52 event, Barry Allen is the only Flash to have ever existed in mainstream continuity, but they have shown Wally West in the future. He's now biracial and [sports a new costume.](http://i.imgur.com/WlY1dv4.jpg)  Bart Allen, in pre-Flashpoint 52 continuity, would be the fourth to become The Flash after Jay Garrick, Barry Allen, and Wally West. [He debuted as Impulse in 1994](http://i.imgur.com/DRUfBsS.jpg) and later became Kid Flash. He's a descendant of Barry Allen and Iris West, but is also a Thawne. Just like Wally West was a sidekick "Kid Flash" to Barry Allen, Bart Allen was a sidekick to Wally West.  Bart Allen even got to be the fourth Flash in his own series ever-so-briefly but was [killed off](http://i.imgur.com/M2OT1Io.png) in 2006 only to be brought back as [Kid Flash in 2009](http://i.imgur.com/mtYf3pJ.jpg) thanks to an event called Final Crisis.   After the continuity reshuffle of Flashpoint and the New 52, he was a time-displaced [Kid Flash](http://i.imgur.com/VwWk678.jpg) with the Teen Titans with some serious amnesia problems.         [Jay Garrick was the original Flash.](http://i.imgur.com/M2VD5ug.jpg) He was [cancelled in 1951](http://i.imgur.com/jyzFIvH.jpg) as superhero comics were waning.

[Jay Garrick existed to Barry Allen as a comic book character.](http://i.imgur.com/9er8eTm.jpg) Eventually, DC thought it would be cool to have the two meet, so to explain this, they were both [The Flash of two different worlds.](http://i.imgur.com/E3JsTF0.jpg)   Flash forward to 1976, Jay Garrick and other old-timey comic book characters were brought back in the parallel world's answer to the Justice League: [The Justice Society.](http://i.imgur.com/LIYkZWa.jpg)  In 1985, DC Comics had one of the biggest events in comic book history called ***CRISIS*** on Infinite Earths. You'll recall The Flash [disappearing in a ***CRISIS***](http://i.imgur.com/Nii95UB.jpg) in Eobard's newspaper from the future. This event merged all the parallel worlds of DC Comics into one, so Jay Garrick was retconned as having [always existed in the same world as Barry Allen and was in fact his predecessor, the original Flash.](http://i.imgur.com/uQ8Bkbz.jpg)  After an event called Flashpoint where [The Flash goes back in time to save his mother from getting murdered by The Reverse Flash](http://i.imgur.com/kBFQbl8.jpg)  (sound familiar?), DC Comics had itself another reboot establishing the New 52, which, among other things, [merged some of their imprints like Vertigo, WildStorm, Milestone, etc., into mainstream continuity](http://i.imgur.com/2x35VNA.jpg) and just generally messed around with continuity with mixed results.   Many of DC's "legacy characters" are now featured in "Earth 2," again establishing multiple worlds. [Jay Garrick is The Flash of Earth 2](http://i.imgur.com/4rmSaSu.jpg), just like he was way back in the 60s.  If anyone has anything to add/clarify/correct, please weigh-in. I know I left a lot out, but my goal was an abridged breakdown of the essentials for the uninformed, not a comprehensive guide.   The strange thing with all this time travel is the paradoxes it necessarily creates. Eddie killed himself, so Eobard was never born, but he only disappears from existence at the time when Eddie killed himself. If he was never born, he never would have existed at all, meaning he never could have gone back in time to kill Barry's mom, blow up the particle accelerator, etc., and no one would have any memory of him because he'd have never existed.  But what's really fucky for me is that Eobard was from a different timeline than Eddie, so Eddie's sacrifice should have only affected *his* future. As soon as Eobard went back in time and killed Barry's mother, he created a new timeline--one that he was stuck in. I would assume the Eddie of *his* timeline, the one he traveled back in time from, is alive and well.  Remember, they have 100% established that going back in time creates a new timeline. Eobard confirmed that when he commented on Cisco's ability to remember what happened to him in another timeline.   So... what if Eddie didn't kill Eobard; he just wanted them to believe he had. We know the wormhole came back, but we don't know what triggered it. Perhaps Eobard never needed the time machine; after all, he didn't have one when he traveled back to kill Barry.   I sometimes read comments or entire threads dedicated to the fact that Batman not only has Tony Stark style money and resources but has literally been shown to have cybernetic armor suits on par or superior to any Iron Man suit, so why in the hell does he go without? That's usually met with a variety of answers trying to explain something that really doesn't make much sense, but what about magic?  It is an established fact that the DC Universe--possibly all of them--has magic. Unlike the armor, you can't say "it's not his style" because his style has consistently been to master the crap out of everything, know everything, be the best there is at everything.   Not only would magic be hugely useful in a number of practical ways, but it would also help him with threats like Superman who are vulnerable to magic (we're talking about a guy who keeps Kyptonite in his utility belt). If the JLA encountered a magical threat, they'd have an ace up their sleeve because Bruce studied the dark arts.   Anybody got an answer for this?         My favorite is probably John Steinbeck's "Of Mice   Men."  **EDIT**: You wonderful people have turned this into one of the best collections of single-sitting reading possible, although I'm not sure I can read this entire thread in a single sitting anymore...            There seems to be a sort of conflation of ideas in that they either reflect your personality/skills and come about accordingly, as evidenced by The Cutie Mark Crusaders trying to "earn" theirs.   They also seem to suggest that they tell you your destiny, as evidenced by that song/episode "What My Cutie Mark is Telling Me" where the Mane Six had theirs swapped.  What I don't get is names. Rainbow Dash, for example, had the words Rainbow and Dash in her name presumably since birth and she grows up to be the one who can pull off a sonic rainboom or whatever? The name "Dash" connotes speed. You could easily write off the rainbow part if the parents didn't name her until she was born and they noticed the color scheme, but unless they were prescient, they couldn't have known her destiny.   The same is true of Fluttershy. Her name rhymes with her cutie mark--a butterfly--and she's shy. These are details her parents couldn't have possibly known about her when she was born.  I considered that maybe parents don't name their kids until these facts are established, but not only do the Cutie Mark Crusaders have names, but the infant children of the baker parents have names.   So what's the deal? Are the parents blessed with some sort of precognition when it comes to naming their offspring? How do foals coincidentally end up with names that represent them every bit as well as their eventual cutie marks do?                              My main question concerns Germany and Japan. Did Japan actually treat their POWs the worst?   [From Wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes#Crimes)  According to the findings of the Tokyo Tribunal, the death rate among POWs from Asian countries, held by Japan was 27.1%.[40] The death rate of Chinese POWs was much higher becauseunder a directive ratified on August 5, 1937 by Emperor Hirohitothe constraints of international law on treatment of those prisoners was removed.[41] Only 56 Chinese POWs were released after the surrender of Japan.[42] After March 20, 1943, the Japanese Navy was under orders to execute all prisoners taken at sea.[43] Around 1,536 U.S. civilians were killed or otherwise died of abuse and mistreatment in Japanese internment camps in the Far East; by comparison, 883 U.S. civilians died in German internment camps in Europe.[44]            I'm a little confused after reading [Douglas Haigs final dispatch](http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/haiglastdespatch.htm) and [David Lloyd Georges comments on the battle of the Somme.](http://www.gwpda.org/1916/llgsomme.html)  I'm just having trouble marrying [Erich von Falkenhayns justification of the Verdun Offensive](http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/verdun_falkenhayn.htm) and [Erich Ludendorffs assessment of Verdun.](http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/verdun_ludendorff.htm)  Is an accurate, fair, unbiased assessment even possible at this point?

I know hindsight is 20/20 and we have the benefit of looking back, but it seems like a clash of at least two of the great powers stacked with new industrial revolution weaponry, mobility, and lethality was inevitable, much less plausible, and yet, it seems it went largely unexpected by the experts. Why?   I know hindsight is 20/20 and we have the benefit of looking back, but it seems like a clash of at least two of the great powers stacked with new industrial revolution weaponry, mobility, and lethality was inevitable, much less plausible, and yet, it seems it went largely unexpected by the experts. Why?            My thesis is that building a successful military depends primarily on three factors: motivations of patriotism/nationalism/jingoism, political motivation/will, and of course, the professional expertise to execute plans.  This is as far as democratic/free societies go; of course a dictatorship will simply build military might as they see fit.       I am in New Hampshire. I have a screen capture of the ad where the claim "needs nothing" is made. I contacted the seller and asked him to take the car back for a full refund and he refused. Do I have any legal recourse? Can I sue for false advertising, or is the "needs nothing" claim to vague?  [Screen cap.](http://i.imgur.com/tNgWvSD.jpg)  **EDIT**: So the consensus seems to be that   1. I'm an idiot.  2. I'm screwed.  3. Get a second opinion on the estimate.  I guess I'll get the second opinion, and I guess I can't sue this guy, but now I gotta figure out what to do with this car if I don't want to pay the three grand to fix it (I don't).

For me, there's Ichi The Killer and Oldboy. Glad I saw them, but once was enough.  **EDIT**: Add Audition to the list, and for whatever reason, I used to watch those Guinea Pig movies in my young 20s. Also, Dog Tooth.      I say "last year or two" because I've seen all the classics and even most of the modern classics. If it features a well-known masked killer or is part of a franchise that requires two hands to count sequels, I've definitely seen it.   The last horror movie I saw that I absolutely loved was The Cabin in the Woods.               	192
    Saved this for wall paper,thanks!   I agree with you on your comment on entry level chef knives, but would like to point out that this kid says he knows nothing about knives. A Victrorinox is good in this case,if I had a Tojiro or a Masakage back in the 70's my nickname would be Stubby and my knives would be rusted.I would advise a beginner to start mid-range and work up from there if they feel comfortable.   http://www.knifeworks.com/ka-barusarmy115thanniversaryknifewleathersheath.aspx   I have a mini-vulcan and a topo meridian and love them both. You have to pick and choose now days as most companies have begun putting out some shit knives along side of their good ones and it is not always easy to tell which is which.   I noticed that every time the gov. starts trying to sell us a war, the local country radio station starts cranking out the hyper patriotic,flag waving,911, hero soldier,kick the enemies ass songs.   The 877-cash now song,I always sing to it.   High end SOG knives like the tom cat or the vulcan come with vg-10 blades and are very well built but a bit pricey.Only have one from CRKT, a fulcrum,that I bought as more of a novelty than a carry.   Nice!   Time to cash in the 401k!   More sheeps foot than warncliffe,"Lil' big foot".   Designer label clothing   That is a very nice classic knife in good condition,You might get $40 or so for it on e-bay. A better plan would be to  store it well,keep it nice,and while you're cleaning it take the time to apreciate some fine old time craftmanship.   Better than calling you uncle George or Grandpa!   Love this.   Ha! This cracked me up. As my wife gets older her voice, body language and manerisems become more like her mom.   What brand?   Nice,I have one of these and use it a lot in the yard and such.      really like the stag handle one. what is it?   People always are worried on how to sharpen a recurve,just strop it on your leg before it gets too dull.   Pricey but very well made, http://www.knifeworks.com/sogminivulcansanmaizytelhandletantobladeplainedge.aspx   From waaaaaay back in the day,Moose Sholack.

I don't think you will be disapointed   While I agree with with Weebus that you can get sharper and better performing knives for the same or a little less money than Shuns,I wouldn't say they are vastly over-priced.It depends on what you want.Shuns are marketed toward the home user and you are paying for the look and fit and finish as well as the blade,I have a set of 6 so far and they,re all flawless and better than most crap out there. I also have a Masakage blue steel2 gyuto that puts them to shame edge-wise,same price as my biggest Shun much better blade but not as pretty and needs more care.Want a fast car that will impress people? buy an Aston-Marton.Want to go faster than every one?

Thanks for the interest it was my brothers, who passed 20 years ago.Don't know how long he had it. I'll never sell it.   Stop cutting when you get to your finger(Chef advice).   Economic bigotry, "I'm wealthy so it's OK to stomp on the less fortunate".    Developed a large nasty abscess on my taint(area between balls and ass),went to ER and was told it had to be sliced open and drained.I am laying on my side with my ass stuck out and one knee up listening to the doctor warning me that this is going to hurt  when the door opens and another doctor asks if I would mind  a young pretty female med student observing the procedure,ever the polite one,I agree.The next 5 minutes were the most painfull and embarrassing of my life.      16 years old and not a single dis,dat, sup or nigga,amazing!   No lack of quality on this knife,it is very tight and well built.      Those are very nice,I'm sure they are collectible.Dollar value depends on many variables.Look on the main blades to see which company made them and google that for a start.Having the sheaths is a big plus.   Don't know, I got these from a flea market awhile back just to save them. I actually worked on the Cattaraugus a bit with some sand-paper but that is as far as I got. I shake my head and tear up when I look at the Puma.   They are  good knives and come sharp out of the box,just be aware that these are carbon steel and need a little exta care.   Top one is my Guy Fieri cheapo beater that I use at work,I like the design of this one. Bottom one is a Dojo brand gyuto wich is a very nice entry level Japanese style knife.   Two old classics ruined,such a shame.         It came with the knife,nice quality.   Very nice,440C and sharp   Sorry   What the fuck has carpet got to do with a nice knife?   I could be wrong but I think they were bought out by Bench Made   This is a well done hand made knife,blade is the russian version of 440C. Came shaving sharp when I got it. However the link I sent you is not where I got this from and I notice that the sheath is a bit different than mine. No problems on mine at all.   Sadly, I don't know if these are still available new. I think Lone Wolf is part of Bench made now.   http://kizlyarus.com/index.php?main_page=product_info cPath=83_5 products_id=33  Thanks for the interest!         You can see this on Netflix by comparing the run times of old shows vs new ones.   Guy in a scuba suit passed out in a small creek.

SHHHH! they mght hear you!   How about gay wrestling or the gay toss at an Aussie bar?   Thank you for adressing my question. I was not looking for a "polished vs rough edge" debate when I made this post,just wondering if anyone has tried a different grit on each side of the edge to improve a cheap knife that will not cut or hold an edge as well as a nice knife.I have some very nice polished knives and they would fit my needs,but I will not use them at my "battle station" nor will I take the time to treat my beater as a high end blade.Once again,thank you for your input.   No comments on the way Masakage knives are sharpened yet,just some guy bragging. Anyone?   Why would you bother to comment if you did not read my question?   Yes it can,but a polished edge meant for chopping will not slice a ripe tomatoe as well as a rougher edge. I use my high end stuff early in the AM for prep, then when we open I throw my beater on the board and have at it. It is a cheap knife and I am looking for the best of both worids.I have made my living with knives for the past 30+ years.Am I doing something wrong? I don't think so   Beater means that this thing lays on my sandwich bar all day and gets shoved around and sometimes dropped. Must slice tomatoes,chop mushrooms onions   peppers,cut sandwiches ect...ect.   My beater knife must chop and slice equally well, plus take a major beating every day.I recently read a good article on the "toothey" vs polished debate and the author half  jokingly said  "A little toothey at the back ,and polish the rest".I thought Hmmmm?. Then I read that the guy who sharpens Masakage and other high end knives uses a different grit on each side of the blade. Has anyone tried this? any thoughts? Knife in question is a cheap German stainless blade,but a step up from the stuff from sysco ect.   What the fuck is a libertarian? Do you mean organized crime?   I agree with that 100%. It's not the working class that's breaking us, it's the greedy corps.   Here in the USA the gov handed out over a trillion dollars to folding banks, who split up the money and had a big party on me and other TAX payers. Then they whine about paying back the money they owe to the people.   Genetically inclined? Birds and certain mammals are genetically inclined to learn to use tools to feed themselves,I place them above you sir,unless your post was a joke, in which case I aplaude your sarcasm.   Well said.   If you earn a paycheck you are taxed for unemployment, how is this welfare?   Ha Ha!, You got the joke!   Glad to be of help,Google carbon steel knife care and the rest of your questions will be answered.   It was a joke   It was a joke dude!   $5? You are a heartless bastard.

 Well...if I read them, I might have a response. But I don't read them, because they would ABSOLUTELY influence my future writing, and I don't want that.  I have some rules of writing that I go by. Rule #1 says "Write something you would want to read." It does not say, "Write something that every Tom, Dick, and Sally would want to read." I think when you try to please everyone, you end up with weird, homogenized BS that NO ONE wants to read, least of all me. And I REALLY don't want to fall into that trap of trying to please everyone.  Glad you liked it!   I personally don't see how an e-book can be more expensive than a print book. I thought my original $3.99-4.99 price point was pretty fair. But apparently not everyone agrees. If I could return it to the original price point, I would. It's certainly been a point of contention with some of the fans, which I hate. I just want people to enjoy reading my books. Not feel like they're being nickel and dimed.   Oh, Ive got advice out the ass when it comes to self-publishing. But, not everything that worked for person A is going to work for person B, so take it with the necessary grains of salt. That being said, Kindle Direct Publishing was incredibly easy to do. I cant speak to any other self-publishing avenues, because I never used any others. As far as KDP goes, if you can upload something to the internet, you can self-publish your book. The single biggest thing that I think helped me out was to establish a readership BEFORE I self-published. Theres just so much content out there right now that simply publishing a book onto Amazon probably isnt going to do much for you, or at least it will take a good long time to get going. What I did, and what a lot of other successful self-published authors have done, was to serialize it in some form or another and distribute it for free, then move forward with publishing it after a readership has already been established.  I actually got an agent because I was receiving so many offers from different audiobook companies and foreign rights subsidiaries. I just had no idea what to do. Also, at the time, I was getting a LOT of requests from people to have the book put into print, so once I had the agent, we both decided to float it out to some publishers to see if there was any interest, and the rest is history. The transition? Wellits painful to relinquish control over something that youve had complete and total control over. So I would say it was painful. Probably, mostly for me, although maybe also for poor ol Will Hinton over at Orbit because I feel like I argued over every comma. Probably gave the guy heartburn. Sorry, Will.   	3

 Wow this was fast! Mandatory: I knew this was going on Reddit after seeing it on stream.   Or as Snoopeh says, gratz on lvl 19, new mastery point for you!   I have a simular glitch: http://img703.imageshack.us/img703/1269/screen03v.png  All drivers are updated, it's been since the last patch. Also, my FPS is lower then it was before, would be around 80 constantly, now it seems capped at 40 with random drops to 20. FPS in client is set to stable, tried others aswell.   1. Often our team will be destroyed when an opposing Katarina is fed, I main adc and feel like there's little to nothing I can do to stop that single-handed. Is there anything I can do?  2. In most of my games I win my lane pretty convincingly but after that it feels like it's up to the team wether we win or not because often teammates lose their lane and I'm not good enough to carry by myself. As long as they don't lose, we tend to win but if they lose their I often get dived 1st thing in the teamfight by a 10-kill fed bruiser/assasin and get wrecked before I can deal dps. TLDR: How can I improve in 'carrying' my team more if I won my lane and they lost theirs?   Relevant name :) Gratz   I no way should he ever gotten a yellow card, this was brilliant.   CP forums on the deep web. The way they talk about children and such, so disturbing..   I read the title as 'dad passed out right before..' and was like, what are they making such a big deal about?   Wait, wuuuuuut?    I think you a word in the title   I peed a little   Do you adopt by any chance? I'm 21, well-spoken, hardly ever wet myself anymore and I'm easy to maintain!   Granted, I main adc and I don't really like him either but you got the whole 'league of draven' culture, he's know to shut down ezreal pretty hard. Then why is he hardly ever picked? Graves get counterpicked vs an ezreal way more often. Is it his lack of a reliable escape? What is it about him or his kit that makes him less viable then others. Thanks!

Thanks a bunch kind summoners!   Ps:no need to upvote   Ah I see, this has indeed cleared things up a bit, thank you kind sir!   Like Late_Night_Grumbler, this is interesting but does not answer the question of why there are so many people downvoting these posts.   In that case, aren't you a bit old to be my dad?   Care to elaborate?

And I'm loving you for it!   r/montageparodies anyone?            I would have a hard time not trying to make fun of them while they lie there 'seizing'   So what do you tell them when you suspect them of faking it? Just say you don't believe them?   This is why I think alot of doctors won't say they think you're faking it, even tough they're 99% sure. In some cases, it can screw them over afterwards for doing a bad job   This is hilarious! Good job (both on the prank and your actual job, paramedics/doctors etc deserve more recognition for the work they do for others imo)   tl;dr: waffles, chocolate, fries and a shit government   That, that and that girl are into you, you're into them. Make a bloody move   Would love to hear some opinions about this because I have pulled this trick aswell when I was younger, claiming I was sick to skip school or for whatever reason. The doctor usually came by and always declared me sick for a few days after heaving heard me symptoms and doing a brief check. Now I wonder if they knew I was faking but just played along (they got payed anyhow..) or because it's out of safety 'what if he really is sick, I don't notice it and something bad happens.  Hope this explanation makes sense, english is not my native language. Thanks for the replies!  EDIT: Holy.. Front page, thank you all!   Riot pls   So you don't want us to look yet you post it on reddit? I'm confused..      Happen to know wich one that is? Thanks   As always, expect OP to deliver   So euh.. How was she before the accident?

Disgusting   I once was home alone and gaming with my headset on, about 1 am,  volume pretty loud. Suddently tought I heard a noise coming from downstairs but I tought it was nothing (we have 2 cats aswell, they tend to make some noises now and then) but the, after about a minute, heard it again. So I put off my headset, listened carefully and aboutt 5 seconds later heard glass breaking. My first tought was still, bloody cats, bumping glass off tables. Went downstairs without turning on lights in the hallway and when I get downstairs I can see trought the living room window 2 guys, each with rocks, throwing in the glass kitchen door. Sneak upstairs while calling the police, telling them very briefly what's going on, taking my dad's katana he keeps next to his bed and go downstairs again. Now they do see me as I enter the living room and flee. Cops then arrived, made a report but were not too happy about me getting the sword and going downstairs again.  What I can understand, at that moment tough, I was so angry because I envisioned not me (21y old male) but one of my little sisters being home alone and them breaking in that I was enfuriated. Sorry for the wall of text  **TL; DR: Was gaming,heard noises, tought it was cats, turned out to be burglars trying to smash in the kitchen window.**   When should this be implemented? Anyone have an idea? Thanks   When should this be implemented? Anyone have an idea?

I'm very sorry for what you have gone through.    like Polar Vortex  next up  Sun Tornado   luckily (knock on wood) I have never had allergies in my 36 years.   sorry, everyone who has allergies.   I want to joke along but I just can't.    subtle? I don't think you know what that word means.   depending on who you are I suppose and where you live etc...  it's not black and white per say.    you do see what is upvoted and what is downvoted, right?   Yep. Seattle had some amazing places. Would spend every day in those shops.   Oh fuck is that like another play on Christianity? Like, wedding alter bridge?          She's a certified dietician?    sounds like an average Tuesday night.   right? I listen to it every few years or so on repeat for like a half an hour. The fuckin jam.   David Forgets was fucking hilarious.   who says?   except maybe someone eating your cupcakes?   yah, why don't people understand this is what boggles my mind.    meat sauce lasagne though, right?               Did a sunset paddle last night on the lake I just moved to. Loving being able to just drag my kayak out and go.      The battery is bulging. Lasts 1/2 a day. Fairly heavy user. Can anyone give me the best amazon link for what I'm looking for?                     I've been looking online and can't seem to find anything that has convinced or otherwise. It's a scary time and while this doesn't seem like it would do any harm is it's still weirding me out.      I got into them really early when they were just starting to hit the scene. Loved everything and then responsibility and my 30's hit and  for some reason keeping up on albums etc went by the wayside.  I spent a good 5-6 years just throwing on the old stuff I knew or just talk radio when it came to silence.  Listening to El Pintor for my first time all the way through. (I know, i'm late) but damn its almost a better feel knowing its a trio. That video for Everything is Wrong. Holy shit is that not the coolest video. 10/10 on that video.                   Not sure if it matters but I'm in the USA and they are in England. Maybe there is some weird thing that gets in the way.   Does this sound interesting? I can cover bass and guitar and any keys. My drums are in storage at the moment and I don't currently own a good mic.   Lets do this!   Any ideas?      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIdrwKL0LZs      It's like /r/fishing just blowing up.             there's got to be something but I'm not catching it. You?      It's strange it happened this way. Of course Sea Change has a lot more "break up" themes but Morning Phase has the same damn feel and all I can do is pump my body full of vodka and soda...and fucking wish I had valium.  Wave might be one of my favorite tracks by him of all time.   I'm 36, have been into all of his stuff from when I was a kid in the early 90's but this album is the god damn fucking bees fucking knees.          No complaints just curious.  Dude is awesome. Anyone follow anything he did the past couple decades? He was in a band called 764-Hero for a time in Seattle. His bass style is awesome.    http://i.imgur.com/rt4Mqz7.jpg         Case in point. Let's take this [Savoir Adore song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4ryqWze6U t=33)  and then this [Taylor Swift song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CmadmM5cOk t=17)  Also, as soon as I noticed this I sent a tweet to Savoir Adore and they replied that funny as I wasn't the first one to mention it.   Fuck, both songs kick fucking ass in my book.   Looking to get a few people together.          Anyone else live in Seattle for their run?  I did, it was grand.   [posting my favorite song by them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc0clTOXlBM)  fans of quality shit get at me if you live in Connecticut. Lets make it.       *sweeeet*   Anyone dealt with this? As always trying to contact them is hilarious. waiting back from an email...      https://youtu.be/ACBaDark4Rs                                       I plug it in but nothing pops up. Am I doing something wrong?    I actually had a front page post of [something related](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qaew2/i_am_a_chef_by_tradetell_me_what_is_in_your/) a couple years ago.  I'm at work with a full kitchen and ready to record. Have at it.  **EDIT** Just getting to edit the first one and going up in a minute. cheers.  **EDIT 2** This is all going to happen but it will take time. Spring project check back.       I introduced it to my girlfriend last month and of course she fell in love so we got in a couple episodes a night and then a good 5 or 6 on Sundays.   Heres the thing...we decided to split up in about the 4th season so we watched one of if not the most deep, relationship heavy shows of all time...while breaking up. We have been together for 6 years. It is fairly amicable but very tough, of course.   We live together and I am going to be the the one moving out. She has kids (from a previous marriage) which I have grown to love and consider family. This is all very difficult but a new beginning.   The last 4 episodes starting with Nates death was just a bawling fest but the finale, which I knew was going to be one of if not the most amazing finales was going to crush us.   Well, it did. We spent the hour or so after the ending just sobbing...talking...apologizing for everything. We are still splitting up but it was very therapeutic to have this all coincide.   Thank you for reading.        New England Brewing Company takes over Haywire taps. Tuesday, February 24th, 5PM. Line up to include: Coriolis, Gold Stock Ale, Gandhi-Bot, Imperial Stout Trouper as well as 668 Neighbor of the Beast and Sea Hag.      I do. 15 gigs left. Whats the deal you think?                     It's an 03 ranger. They have a lift and full shop... but is there anything I can do to "prep" before I head down there?                     Have you ever come across something after they have passed away as well?  EDIT: To clarify. Some alcoholics instead of flaunting it or not give a shit will attempt to hide it. That's what this post is all about.                     I live in Connecticut directly across from you and I thought it would be fun sometime to try and get a picture of something silly like a roman candle or something.   I see your lights often when it's clear.               I've got an 03 Ford Ranger which has been diagnosed by two shops as needing a new transmission. It's drives but I have no reverse or O/D. It shifts into reverse and when I press on the gas it budget a bit. What I am currently doing is turning off the O/D switch on the column and manually shifting 1st into second and then second into D which it then in turn shifts itself from 3rd to 4th.   A friend of mine has an 02 Explorer which has a blown engine but a working transmission. Both of these vehicles are 4.0 4X4 and Automatic. I'm wondering if I could switch it out? The VIN#'s for both are:  Ranger 1FTZR45E63TA39056  Explorer 1FMDU73K52ZC97255  Also, if not is there any way I could buy one online on the cheap and do it myself (I'm fairly handy). I've got a general knowledge of how these work and a 250 piece craftsman socket set but would rather pay someone if it's impossible for me to do this on my own.            Keeping mine in comments.         Of course something so simple is eluding me.    Looking for a mechanic to do some work on the side or anyone who is comfortable doing a tranny switch. I have the vin numbers for both vehicles to make sure they are compatible. 02 ford explorer to a 03 ford ranger. Both automatic both 4.0. both v6. Located in Deep River.    Let's hear it.                      Why am I having such a terrible time figuring this out?         In the late 90's I owned a [Boss BR-8](http://www.bossus.com/gear/productdetails.php?ProductId=437) and I recently came upon a dozen or so of my zip discs.  I have an [iomega zip 100](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Iomega-Zip-100-Drive-USB-100MB-pc-mac-compatible-usb-powered-nice-/201267810149) which is allowing me to download the files. They are in vs3 and vr8 formats.   Does anyone know where to go from here? Has anyone had any luck? In a perfect world I would love it if there was a Boss app that would just accept these files and let me connect it via fire cable on my ipad.  Yah, right.  I own a windows 7 laptop and an ipad 4gen.  Any ideas?  Thanks for reading.               Sure hoping so.             I think they held on to some big guns in the writing department for this series finale via 4 episodes. There was a time where I was falling "out of love" with the show but these past 2 episodes have really brought me back and now I'm super sad its really going to end.   I am preparing myself by starting to watch Six Feet Under all the way through (again)        	198
 I have more than one set of bed sheets. How poor are you?    No, only I call him Zuck, because we're, uh, cool like that.    Found your mom's dildo!   Found the wife!    I feel the same way when I'm having sex with her.    Bird is the word?   9 and 3 because race car.   The op with the tattoo should copyright the charmander picture so he can sue all of you for reproducing it lol   Just curious as to what equipment you've been using to mix or practice on that you don't know how to to set up your laptop.  Just a word of warning, set up a time before your gig so you can hook up all your equipment and make sure it works. A few days before the gig if possible, sinceb it sounds like you don't even have all the equipment you think you need.   I'd also have a back up plan, like having a bunch of tracks prepped on a USB drive in case you can't hook up your laptop. I'd suggest setting them up in rekordbox if you're using CDJ's.     You must be young because you'll soon find out that owning a dick in Vegas is very expensive.    If I was a girl, I would not be bragging about sleeping with an idiot like will I am.   Well he IS in a Mets jersey.    Fuck the textbook industry! Bunch of crooks.    The clap!    Ha! Joke's on you. I've broken plenty of condoms and have never gotten my hands pregnant.    Is OP Paul Rudd?   Hold my balls, I'm going in.  FTFY    Not trying to be a dick, but are you really asking people on the Internet how something "feels?"  I'd recommend going into a music store that would have the same model on display so you can test the feel.    Wouldn't this be more aptly called "core licks?"   Was THAT sarcastic?    LANAAAAAAAAA   Now my penis is depressed.    Does she jump into the toilet bowl before you have to pee?   It's more comfortable.   The biggest thing that everyone is overlooking is the fact that you would remember nothing from the future,  so it wouldn't make any difference when you "saved."  You would just wake up at your "save" point like any other day and continue on with life as you would always have.    People who work there are empowered to take care of the customer as they deem fit. It won't hurt the bottom line much if you realize just how many drinks get thrown out in a day.  Also, giving away a drink and then having that person, most likely, share their experience with friends or on social media is probably one of the cheapest (and most effective) type of marketing they can buy.    If a place accepts tips then tip them.   Correct. The iced venti cup is 24oz.   He's got the right idea.  Coke is expensive, you know.   Fuck! They're on to us.    The air filter replacement prices are such a ripoff. You can buy them for much cheaper at almost any auto part store and replace it in a matter of minutes. A simple youtube search will yield instructions.  *on most cars.   Not to mention pubes.   That's what we call "gambling."   If you put it on your butthole, it will go numb.   And everyone wins.    Wait, did I do that right?    From the title, I thought they discovered 100 billion barrels just out in a field somewhere.    Get away from him, he's foaming at the mouth!    What!?   I think I have that set as well. Not a bad set.   "I never looshze"  -Sean Connery   You silly goose. The happiness lies in the experiences you share with people, while doing drugs, not in the drugs itself.   I would say professors have never seen the cleverest way to cheat because the cleverest cheater has never been   (_)   ( _)-   (_)   caught.   Ha!   OP is now dead from a car accident.   You can eat a lot of fish.   Golded, golded, golded.  Is it ironic yet?    Looks like you got golded again for it.   A posh wank   When you bust before the picture fully loads and you didn't see any nudity because it loads top to bottom.  Man, I hate 56k.    Burger King is still in business?!   Remind me again second second base is? Is that hands stuff?   Clicked on the subreddit and the first 2 links were purple. Oops   I'm old school, I use a hand held torch.    That's a few seconds too long.    I rarely ever look at a person's username.    You should talk about ideals and your philosophy on life. You should let them share there point of view with you. If you end up sharing your life with this person then it's critical that you both have simular ideals about life.   Gender roles, the belief (or lack of belief) in a god, ethics, food, long term life goals (like what/where you want to end up so that you'll feel happy), and family goals (like when/if you want marriage and kids). These are some heavy subjects but eventually you'll  want to discuss them.   I hate it when unexperienced guys sleep with virgins. They're always too eager and don't know how painful it can be. This is why I try to avoid virgins.   Meow meow meow   A+++++ would read again!!!   I sucked a dick for $20 bucks.  I'm not gay, but $20 bucks is $20 bucks.    Ne pas toucher.   Cheenis   LA has underground trance and psytrance parties.   Some ways I've seen people tip:  * $1 per drink, regardless of price or effort.  * $1 per drink for drinks that only require pouring (ex. beer, a shot, a glass of wine, etc.)  * $1 per drink, and will increase with difficulty/complexity of drink being made. (Usually an arbitrary amount decided by the patron).  * Percentage of total (usually 20%).  **Bartenders:** How much do you expect to be tipped? What is the amount of tip that can be left, where you will still feel stiffed, even though a tip was left? Do you ever feel that, due to slow service or messing up an order, you deserved a lower than normal tip?  **Bar patrons:** How much do you tip your bartender and what is your reasoning behind it?   Cumming so hard that your spinal cord snaps and you lose consciousness while laying in a pool of your own liquid.    Some lives you kill more people.   	66
 www.windows93.net if you want to know the difference between xp and 95/98    You mean alderwood    eew.  That's a long ass trip in one of those.  Farthest I've gone is like Central Oregon to Denver.   That's a regional plane that takes you from closer small cities to connecting hubs.  They are tiny for a normal person.    The ending of Furious7.  For Paul.   Honestly, if the phone on the lines 2 and 3 have the same sim card slot you can just swap sim cards and don't even worry about anything else.     Yeah you have to get the coupe for the folding seats.  The trunk is really small in the coupe though   There's an advanced mode.  You can customize your own map and buildings.  There is lots to do beside gain population and solve the issues along the way.   YOU'RE THE GUY THAT DID THAT!!!! OMG (good for you)   I had one of these too.  I loved that my shirt could change color just like my hot wheels   The lighter thing was around in the early 90's.  I remember kids doing that   Up until recently I had a copy of that sealed with the "golden CD" possibly inside.  I thought it might be with something later.    I've never been able to get Google voicemail working on any Verizon phone for years now.    There is a G35 sedan around here that has nbeyond as their licence plate   Yup, I have access to 3 different companies fedex number. I've never gotten a 2nd look when I come in and just spit out a number and say bill to sender.  I don't know if I've ever mixed them up.   You account is 1Z[account number][generated tracking number]  So, yeah, if you know anything about UPS you could use someones account number.   That's why sand is where it's at.   or a bike?   My wife was at amgen. It's a really nice spot for sure.  The funny thing is, she got into a program that teaches women to become a full stack web developer. Then they give internships to sponsoring companies, one of which is Expedia.  She could end up working in the same building again   It's the wax of the candle and soot that is coating the egg.  THAT's the hydrophobic property you see.   Are there tech/biotech companies going or starting there?   16 exabytes, yikes.  Fyi, The current limit on a single drive is 128PB due to lba48 addressing   yeah, Gti has ~220hp, the Hellcat has ~720hp   "Have you seen the faces on Mars? That's proof right there.  The aliens were here, they still are here, and aren't going anywhere"  Is my tag line apparently.   oh yeah, that term is getting thrown around a whole lot on Capitol Hill   Ray...when someone asks if you are a god, you say YES!!   I'm 6'3" and dated a girl that was 4'10".  She barely came up to my sternum.  Opportunities were endless.   Your penance is the commute and ever worsening traffic.  I prefer to live up north a bit.  More spendy than Tacoma, but it's not Tacoma   The GTR can corner.  I'd love to see a pro driver take a Hellcat on Laguna Seca and then the GTR.  I bet there is more than 2 second lap times faster in the GTR.  EDIT [it's over 6 seconds a lap faster than the Hellcat at Willowsprings](http://fastestlaps.com/tracks/willow_springs_-_streets_of_willow.html) and it's only 2.5 seconds faster than a GTi that has almost 500hp less.  The Hellcat is a muscle car and a damn fine one, not a supercar.   At the current rate Seattle will be the next SF in the near future    Seattle is looking at SF as what things may come.  TONS of tech job openings that pay 60-100k/yr.  That's easily liveable money in Seattle.  People are coming in droves to work at Amazon, Google, HBO, ADT, Starbucks, Zillow, Redfin, Adobe, Expedia, M$, Nintendo, Pokemon, Nordstrom, and countless startups.  They are buying up/renting out all the apt's near downtown to minimize the shitty commutes forcing out all the artsy folks that are barely making money as is.  It's creating a pretty big divide between the people that have been there for decades and these new transplants.  Not sure how to stop it from following suit other than I'm happy I live where I live.   yeah, that's $1000 more than what I pay to own my house.   at least they have plenty of room to build and cheap property to do it.  SF really has no where to grow but up.  Until then, it's going to be more and more expensive.   If I wanted to buy the same house I have have now in SF (brand new construction, 4bd 3.25 bath, 2500 sqft) it would cost 2-4 times more than what I paid, and it would have been built in the 1920s.  Thats 4-8 times more than the house I had before with similar specs.  Both me and my wife would need to both be making 6 figures to live the way we do now.   I know Strokin' is a real song, but then again, "Let me smell yo' dick" is also a song so I'm not sure if you were joking or not.   I have a performance car (~350hp).  This is a budget supercar (500hp+).   You have to go to a place that can read the sensors in each of the tires directly.  Any big tire store can do this.  It could be a dead battery in one of them since it's pushing 10 years old.   yeah the VZW box says it's "Black" when it means the Midnight Blue   What about Strokin' by Clarence Carter?   200k+ miles shouldn't be unheard of as long as it's taken care of.   Just make sure to keep the fluids and filters changed.  Inspect the belts and change as needed.  In NYC, keep the salt off the car in the winter.    This is the fallacy of sunken cost.  Get out, shut down, sell it.    Small businesses fail 85% of the time after 3 years.   The good ones, applied properly, have 0 bubbles   The En rogue what you want then   I've not been to the seatac international arrival one, but lax has an automated kiosk that takes your picture and you fill out more paperwork, then go to a human   I think it's faster because you have to go to a kiosk, then wait in line for one to open up, fill out your info, then head to the line to get to a person.    This will save time as you can bypass the first section and go straight the the line waiting for the agent.   In '99 had a '97 Eclipse turbo.  I had some mods in (275 whp) it and not too flashy, but it stood out.   That was the only time I ever had girls initiate conversations with me based on my car.  I found several notes on my car after I would leave work ask me to give them a call.  This was only after Fast and Furious was in theaters, so I had the same car that was at the beginning of the movie.   ...YOU DRUGGIE BITCH!  I THOUGHT IT WOULD BRING CLOSURE TO OUR RELATIONSHIP!    I know exactly what you are talking about. I don't think I have them anymore, but I'll look.  EDIT: [Someone animated that clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EXqPriuHHI) ...AAAAAND [here's the donald one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDaWs4v2U1A) NSFW on both obviously   yeah.  All their stuff is plenty durable...until you move.   Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.   LEGO Marvel killed mine :(   My ps3 lasted 7 years.  Best Blu-ray player ever.  Bought it day 1 and it just yellow lighted in November.   cool. good to know.   I can feel where it might happen to me as well.  I have the bumper case and it's a noticeable ridge where the port is    lol, instead of 1.8(temp in C)+32.    Technically, you could change the exhaust and intakes.  As long as you kept the factory parts and put them back on before you give it back.    The dealer might bitch a little, but you'd have to read the fine print of your lease.   I'd argue that you have some [pretty fine roads](http://i1.trekearth.com/photos/61830/transfagarasan.jpg) I've been here. The way up looked a lot like OP's pic.  But this road once you reach the summit... OMG.   According to a former BBC employee, this is the best road...IN THE WORLD.   That's weird, I used to be able to talk on my galaxy nexus and use 4g at the same time. What changed?   Oregon was 503, then it became Portland metro.   You can stack every planet side by side and it still doesn't span the distance from the earth to moon.   Space is...astronomically big.   Man, the commissions have really gone to crap since I was there. It was like $10-$15 per computer, ~$5 per monitor, $3-$5 per cable, and 15% of the extended warranty.  I know there is no margin in computers now, but only $6 for the warranty? Damn.  I was one of the top three sales guys in Oregon around 2002.  I would make $650-$800/wk in commissions plus minimum wage (which basically took care of taxes).  In today's dollars that would be $65-$70k/yr slinging electronics. I'd be interested to hear how much people are making today.   Amazon Drones = Skeet shooting with prizes.   My parents bought something similar to this back in the 80's.  It stacked the length and height of our garage, one box wide.  We lived about 7 miles from the nearest town of about 15000 at the time.  This was in Texas and tornados are common.   We never touched the stuff and even when we moved to Oregon in the 90's, they moved it as well.  Still never touched it and gave it away in when it was pushing '99.    Nearest shipping center? Is there really a major metro in Maine?   They have like 50 warehouses strategically placed in major metros.  I would think that most of the population would live near one.   They approved an experimental drone, http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/19/8259881/amazon-prime-air-delivery-drone-faa-permission    but it's not the one they are currently working on, so it was useless to them. http://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-says-its-approval-to-test-delivery-drones-already-obsolete-1427219327   They were playing with the idea of using Taxi's/Uber for 1 hr delivery in places near the warehouses.   still slower than driving to a retail store that has the same thing in stock. (assuming same price)   Maintenance = keep the oil and filters changed regularly, inspect belts and replace as needed. Other than that you should be good to go.  Cosmetic, it's totally up to the owner's tastes and objectives.  Key fobs...not going to be cheap AFAIK.   /r/infiniti is your friend guys.   He got the job because he went off for several minutes without repeating a single line.  He was a consultant for the before that.  Kubrick swapped the actor for him after hearing that   This happens when the car's battery is disconnected and the window isn't all the way up.  On my Infiniti, you have to roll the window all the way down, then hold the up switch until is all the way up and then keep it there for 15-30 seconds.   What the hell am I looking at?   NOW. You're looking at now, sir. Everything that happens now is  happening now.  Go back to then!  What?  THEN!  I can't!  Why not?  We passed it!  When?  Just now!  When will then be now?  SOON!   We need to be permanently on -7 utc   I have the 3m film on the front of mine. No chips or scratches   Yeah that's what pre orders were for. It guaranteed you a copy at the place you wanted to buy it.  Now with infinite copies via digital, it's something that should be retired.  Now they bait you to buy a game that might not even be good with "exclusive" things that are not useful or cosmetic at best.   I was doing it from memory, I guess it was exposure, not focus.  My bad.   AH, never could figure out what it did.   FYI, under Advanced in the stock camera, there is a Manual focus mode toggle.   Didn't do anything, she took a few minuets to put it all together   Not saying people do, but it's usually the rules that no one follows   A car dealer did this back in 2000 to my step dad.  He had picked out and paid for a brand new 2001 jeep grand Cherokee, but he didn't want it delivered until Christmas morning.    A few days before, the dealership calls and asks how she is liking her new car.  He was not pleased.   Even having lived in Portland, it's still meh most of the time   Most of the cars in my town have snow tires, AWD or otherwise. Huge ski town.    It still is that way in most of the US.  Pedestrians have the right of way, always.  However, it's not about who's right, it's who's left.   Looks closer to Mongolia   Some do. Newer five guys places are where I see them most   You can try to contact Motorola and ask, but just setting the expectations realistically    Trendy downtown area, look in capitol hill.  Trendy just outside of downtown, look at Ballard, Fremont, Wallingford.  Queen Anne is kind of in between those.   It's a known thing since the day it was released.  US warranties won't cover it from international places.  If you got it back to the US you could get it replaced by Motorola   You want a pg-13 movie with a actual nudity? The Fifth Element.     Looks like the most legit answer   I took my wife's '00 323ci out in the worst snow we had all year.  With snow tires and the DSC we were getting around just fine while SUV's and Subaru's were in the ditches   You mean 52 coupons... One for each week.  I won something similar at Hollywood video. Free rentals for a year.  52 new release coupons and 100 non new releases   Which was the same premise of a [duck tales episode]( http://imdb.com/rg/an_share/title/title/tt1052614/) 15 years earlier. (Which, in turn, was based on a H.G. Wells story from 1901)   My Michelin pilot super sports barely lasted 30k miles, but damn do they grip   This is why tide is currency on the black market   They were referring to San Francisco.   The place is packed on the weekends from the times I've been there.   You mean like Cafe Mox in Seattle?  That place is packed most weekend nights.   Wasn't there this morning.  I was playing with the smart lock stuff then, because the location based portion wasn't working.   It's there now.   Not to mention he hasn't really been able to get a normal job since he's been out.  He's been doing odd jobs or self employment ventures   Go hometown! Haven't been there in 25 years though   Step brother was looking at close to 40 years for weed... Did 13.   So far, Smart lock doesn't seem to like my house, but connected to BT in the car works.  My Wifi had some issues on AC, I factory reset the router and it fixed it. It was definitely the router.  Nothing would connect to the AC band.   I don't think it's a girl's car per se.  I will say that IMHO only the RWD coupes look the most manly/sporty.  I can spot a X series and sedans (obviously) a mile away.  There's just something about the coupes that look amazing.   probably to get around YouTube's copyright algorithms.  It sees these and says it's definitely not Star Wars.  	106
 The ayahuasca line just totally knocked it out of the ballpark.   HI SUPERNINTENDO CHALMERS!  I'M LEARNDING.   What does that mean, though? I feel better when I take 50mg a day in the morning regularly.   k   *based god   Because a closed system will always experience misanthropy.   Can we go ahead and get a pale Jew Dot?

Sometimes I go back and do another fingerprint later.  I might be doing 30mg a day/40mg a day.  You guys all take like 10x the amount I do and complain of symptoms.  So weird.   Phenibut.

          Surprisingly yea though I like Alasdair very much!      Thanks for the info. So there is no existing solution for this?   Yea so my question is, is there and Arduino-like product that has a good enclosure as well without having to design it with a 3D printer?     Thanks but as I said in the earlier comment, she won't like the Arduino shape itself, I need a well designed enclosure package.   Yea but I meant the packaging and enclosure + I don't want to build a  new PCB, I have space for the Arduino but itself needs to have a good package design.       I mean a beautiful designed platform that I can use to build the project and then give it to someone as a gift, something without the hassle of wires and visible boards. Any ideas of the existence of such platforms?   Yea I send SMS and it stops :D         Thanks for the answers guys!      Super cool! Add [1Sheeld](http://www.1sheeld.com) to the collection, it turns your Android smart phone into a generic Arduino shield, so you can use its sensors and capabilities.   	17
 ah yes, looks like a japanese pull saw used in woodworking so often.     pallet wood ? that could be treated with all sorts of chemicals.  I'd *hope* he was taking the piss, but then, haggis ;)   I think the stuff I have no is probably dry enough to give it a go. I do recall that the first thing I ever smoked, even before I had a proper smoker, was a turkey leg on a gas grill, with apple chips and it was delightful.     thanks!    Oh, if you like Indian food I have something for you: get yourself some Tandoori Masala, and make it up the usual way (I use two packets and double the yogurt) but then *inject* it into chicken - I'm a fan of things.  And then *smoke* it.  Yes, injected, smoked, tandoori chicken.  It's to die for.    In the States it's called tailgating, and it's typically not well received.  I've heard of people tossing coins out of windows at tailgaters.   I was taught to continue my own speed, drive the way I want to drive. If you speed up, it may entice them more to tailgate you further.  That said, if you're in the left lane, get out of the left lane.    yeah same here, I just check every once in a while and make sure everything is worth more than when I bought it.  As long as it's net positive and I'm not losing money, I'm happy. Can't ask for anything more.  Beyond that, I try to make solid gains, but at the end of the day not losing money counts ;)     Investing it like barbecue... just stop looking at it eh, just let it cook.     are you investing or trading ?    I would have fileted that bitch and served it with a Goldschlagger sauce.  Just, you know ... 'cause.    Oh man, smoked meat going into southwestern food.  If there's a way I could sneak a roux and a curry into that it'd be all my favorite foods into one.   on/off "faucet" tap  Bro.  Put a hydrolock on it.  When you want to pour water out (instead of sipping on it) either pull the mouthpiece off, or pull the whole hydrolock out, then put it back in.  Works like a champ, filling pots, washing, dog bowls whatever.      Sounds  like she's a tenderfoot.  Did she do any regular training before the 30 miles ?     yeah, I can't remember the last time I actually screened.    oh god yes, you actually have dried wood in the UK? I imagine vast warehouses, labelled "dry stuff" strategically located around the country, just full of random things people would like to keep dry.     mmhmmm, especially if he smuggled in a bit of that Courvoisier.   yeah, the more I think about it I guess either way would work fine.     thanks ! Guess I'll let it dry for a bit first.    I'm genuinely surprised foreigners are allowed to buy your houses.  Do they just buy it outright ? Like some guy in Asia browses real estate websites, goes "Wow, fuck, Vancouer is cheap as shit I'm gonna buy a house there and just sit on it for 20 years"  or do they form REITS or some other form of entities that are actually created in your country ?  As in it may be foreign money, but its' actual domestic purchases ?    oh man, another great idea ! I did one years ago, a whole salmon from Costco, it was unbelievable.   And, I presume, meanwhile fucking over the locals who get priced out of their own communities ?    unlocked.  I guess so that when they start swarming in through the air vents you can doing your screaming escape from the vehicle without impediment.    these bees sound nasty.    I like Jefit.    Buying a house.  In a few more years the rent at my old apartment will be more than the mortgage of my house.  My house is nice (nothing fancy), big yard, many bedrooms in a very nice neighborhood, my apartment not so much.   So it was tough at first, but soon I'll be paying less than what my rent would be and getting like 2 -3 times as much for it.    Right now I have plenty of dead apple and pear in the back yard, as well as a couple cherry trees who one day may donate wood.  I've only ever smoked with dried store bought hickory.   if I want to smoke with the apple or bear, do I need to wait for it to completely dry or can I smoke with it still green ?    actually it *has* been a while since I did chicken or turkey ... and I have some freshly felled pear and apple in the yard ... thanks for the idea !!   TRADING ?  Sorry, can't help you there, I don't trade.  I invest. Perhaps not as long term or as shrudely as others, but I hold stuff for months and years.    Was the winner crowned the Scythe Lord ?  Ducking off stage now ...    don't forget the economics at play either ... the ration of responders to citizens is likely to be higher in the suburbs (whom has less people) as well as the funding (taxes).    jeebus ! Are these folks passing out at frat parties or something ?    I gave up on the idea of rational investing years ago. I chase performance, even with my funds.    There, I said it.  Been good to me so far though, say what you will.    LoL.  I carried a machete once.  But then, was in jungle.  Was actually super useful.     I would actually argue that a software developer would do better at analyzing individual issues than the big level questions here. OP is asking about the high level... this isn't data, it's experience.   Analyzing the issues is much more about the data though IMO.    One pro for individual equities is you can get in and out of them alot faster than funds.  So if you're playing around with play money and just want  to do some speculative short time stuff, they're much better IMO.  Buying an individual equity is as safe or as risky as you want it. There are highly rated stocks  that are low risk, low gain or vice versa.  Remember that a fund's risk/growth rating is an aggregate of it's underlying issues.  You'll also save on management fees with individual equities versus funds.   That said, I don't own any issues anymore.  I used too - consumer goods, tech... companies I knew well, knew their space well as well as their strategies and positioning ... but I moved everything into leveraged funds when the recovery market started taking off and have been doing exceptionally well in them.    So ok, here's one vote for doors before floors.    yeah, flush cutting is a beautiful thing.  I've used long recip blades for it in the past, but if I'm stuck doing this work myself I'm gonna spring for a proper flush saw.  Rent one at least.      But the requirements clearly stated "variety of colors and sizes".      Well, at least I learned they're a lot less greasy on the second day.  And actually cold ribs right from the fridge aren't bad.    OP has an Uncle named Mose ?    It's just cause the dog knows he can't get away with hitting a chick.   You've already rang local quarries asking if they would want to buy it cheap and resell it ?  You'll sometimes find construction goods on Craigslist as well, but that means storing it.    Yes.   thank you!    ;)     ain't wrong.   thank you! on our first floor we hadto use engineered flooring to go directly over a slab.  For this second floor, we have the option of using solid if we want, or some of the newer innovations like click...any recommendations on which you'd go  with ?  The manufacturer doesn't make the flooring we used on the first level (a very light natural oak color) so it's going to be mismatched either way.   The has stated in the past that they don't feel talk like this is appropriate for here because there's a facebook group, except I don't  use Facebook.   Is there a forum somewhere where I can banter about contractors with other locals, and not only discuss quality of work (which sites like Angies list are good for) but also *pricing* (which those sites aren't good for).  I would just like to discuss contractors with folks and experiences and relative pricing so I don't have to get a million estimates for every little job ...I don't know why but picking contractors has always been stressful for me.  I just want to talk to neighbors about who they used for what, how much they charged, how happy they were with the work, etc.        Which is ok because that entire restroom has NOPE written all over it.     plot twist, architect decides entire thing needs refactoring   Hello HomeImprovement !  We want to replace a bunch of doors (and the surrounding casing etc)  as well as install hardwood flooring.   Should I have the flooring done before the doors ? Thx !    I've smoked countless ribs over the years.  I make my own rub with love, and it's a very popular one, and I go through the usual pains of smoking them.   They're always delicious, but they're just becoming unappealing to  me as I cut back on fat in my diet.  I do lean towards spareribs because they're cheaper and tastier than back ribs IMO.  I still love brisket, but lately I find myself just getting turned off by the fattiness of ribs.  Maybe I need to switch to back ribs, better quality spare ribs, or maybe I'm doing something wrong.  Either way, when the ribs came off the smoker yesterday and we ate, I realized I wasn't enjoying ribs much anymore.  I think I'll buy some brisket and butts for a bit.  Just wanted to get this off my chest.       nice. also, shouldn't the size be a property of an object as opposed to a string ?   believable.    I'm definitely addicted to media and connectivity.   I'd love to lose the phone for a week, but in my case it could very well mean both my house and job are completely falling apart ... so I need at least a smidgen of phone to check in with the family, and in case there's a pressing emergency from work, at least I'll get news of it within a day or two and not  like eons later (hectic work pace, 2 days is an eternity around here).    I do ;) Actually doesn't take that much data just to watch one TV show episode.   LoL, nice post.  Actually I'm pretty knowleadgeable about firearms, having owned several and spending my 20's in the Infantry.  I just don't see the need for them on the trails around here (Midatlantic area... I see more wildlife in my own yard than on the trails... literally.  sad but true).    oh yeah ...   I'm in Maryland, and I've found all sorts of shady/lazy/whatever crap on Realtor.com on listings around here.  I don't mean the hyperbole - that's just a reality in sales - but I mean completely junk information.  I remember writing their customer service about it once years ago and they said there wasn't much they could do.  However, IIRC they recently implemented the ability to provide listing-specific feedback.      TIL: They have access to Rambo movies in the Middle East.     My SO is South Carolinian   OP knows what's up.    And in the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel  - just saw it last night and was thinking "man, I need to talk to my landscaper about that"    Ah gotcha, you're driving around for months, during which time you'd like to take a few week long or maybe even 2 week long trips.   Depending on where you are, you could be perfectly fine just leaving the car very obviously empty and at the trailhead parking.  Or you could visit the local visitor center / Ranger station for the area, and ask if you can long-term park there, particularly if you're living out of your car for the many month's long trip (and thus can't leave  it empty).     LoL. Having never been to Washington, that's actually my impression of the whole state.    I'm going to do my best to translate this:   "I live in a popular skydiving spot, and one day we heard a scream and found an unattended, unopened main parachute on our roof. We called the cops, they said wait for the skydiving company.  Sure enough they arrived and said something about incomprehensible but we were able to get the gist that the parachutist died. So we LoL'd, and I posted to /r/funny.   Because dead parachutist. Or Not, I'm still not sure.  Also, there was a reed involved."   Dem Pants   The name merges Chi-town with Iraq -- as if Chicago sinks like the godforsaken Iraq, a hopeless war zone to the world.  Thanks for the explanation CNN. Was having a hell of a time figuring that one out by myself.      Gaia GPS  Ah .. I'm a map and compass kiinda guy.  the only time I've ever used a GPS in the woods is to track my timing on a "fast pack" I did, and I used the same app I use to track my runs.       First 12 seconds were ok.    TIL: They have black lights at Line Dancing.   yes, that sounds a bit  more plausible.   gotcha.  I've actually been thinking about a battery operated mp3 player for a bit now... lol.  Music is a *huge* part of my life and lol, I guess I go a bit stir crazy on the trail.  I've actually sung out loud while hiking just to have some music.     High altitudes in the Sierra  Doh! My bad ... yeah, definitely beyond "just the liner" weather !    Lived here my whole life.  Can confirm  - can't get away from the stuff.    Once in a time I even liked it, until it was just getting dumped (and I do mean dumped) on everything.  Took a chance on a local McDonald's promotion - Old Bay Filet of Fish.  Nearly puked.   It's not bad as crab seasoning, but locals know the only thing worse than a crab cut is a crab cut with Old Bay.      IIRC, he's succesfully defended himself against multiple lawsuits, which would easily explain why they wouldn't be taking any legal action against them.  They're doing exactly their only choice - beating him at his own game.  Good for them.     yes, yes and yes.  The front looks like my mid-atlantic yard right now ... just all green.  Being in Florida OP has the luxury of being able to easily grow all sorts of incredibly colorful plants that would be considered exotic up here.  I would stage them by height as well as by blooming season and add some color to the place.  No need for plain green shrubbery down there !     right, like a welcome distraction.  airplane mode definitely helps preserve the battery.  My phone's battery usage is rather poor though, so I always bring a large external battery pack that will charge it several times over.  To be honest though it's a bit large and heavy so I've been rethinking that bit as I continue to lighten up.   Audiobooks you could put on a small mp3 player no ?    "Let's Interface".  Yep, sure to work wonders, especially in the 80's when everyone knew what "interface" meant.    Not easily accomplished, no, but had to be easily detectable.   I wonder if there was inside help ?    I miss boomboxes.    Good fertilizer.   Oy.    actually, tweezers are more multi-purpose, but for ticks themselves check out the tick key.    damnit. everytime I tell myself "this trend of everyone hiking with guns is ridiculous, I don't need one and never will" someone shares a story like this.    many *month* ? Post said "2 weeks".  For a many month trip I would leave the car right at home, and get a ride or transit to the trailhead.      true, fair enough, I assumed OP meant to take out with him    out of curiosity, how many paperbacks == weight of Kindle ?    Oh definitely.  It was a guilty pleasure for sure, at the time better than sneaking a snort of whiskey, or leaving the trail for a nice meal.  Just that one momentary touch of "civilization".    If you can't be with the house you love than love the house you're with.    Meh, I feel you, but my bigger problem is the number of agents who LITERALLY cannot be bothered to enter the footage at ALL, or who blatantly lie about the footage (4k feet, click picture, it's a tiny rancher) or include garage/basement in footage.   And don't even get me started on the number of listings without a lot size.   Or listings that present themselves as SFH's, you keep reading and realize the property doesn't even fucking EXIST.  They used a model picture, and are listing houses to be built on demand as existing properties.      I should be so lucky as to find a pizza place that actually has anchovies   14 mile day on the AT.  Exhausted, pitched my tent, collapsed into it right as the rain started.  Fired up the phone for the evening "I'm still alive" call and realized I had a really, really good cell signal.  And that I didn't have that many miles left, my external battery pack was still fully charged and ... well, next thing you know I'm continuing my Netflix binge from the Appallachian Trail.    I know I can't be the only one who has done this eh ?    Right, sorry about that.     I have a Nemo as well as a Big Agnes Q Core.  I'm a huge fan of the ease of use and built in pillow of the Nemo, but it doesn't feel quite as warm as the BA.   I also discovered that Big Agnes bags have odd measurements ... it says they accomodate a 20 inch pad, but the sleeve actually only accomodates a 19ish inch pad, and while the BA pad is supposed to be 20 inches, it's actually just shy of that and happens to fit my BA bag perfectly.   Both quite light, "20 in", quite comfy.  The BA one packs smaller and lighter.  Neither have the mylar krinkle to them.   Very satisfied with both, but tend to take the BA around with me more as - despite having to puff into it - it's smaller, lighter and fits my shoulder bag.     You're camping in the Ia Drang Valley ?    I'm showing Southwest flights from ATL to Portland as low as 142 depending on timing.    "footprints" are most definitely overpriced, but I find them very handy.  When we're going car camping, all of the State park sites are covered in gravel.  Dumbest thing, but I guess they do it for all the folks with campers, RV's, etc.  The footprint helps protect my much more expensive tent floor in that case, and goes underneath it against the gravel.   For my backpacking tent, then footprint helps protect the *inside* of the tent's floor from my dogs paws.   Both help with moisture.  No, you don't have to buy theirs, you can easily make your own.    Oh it's even better than that here in the Maryland ... every State park I've gone camping in has had shower houses, just like at a gym, outdoor sinks for dish washing, and wells for potable water.   People bring three generations out all the time ..  Downside, camping pads literally put us closer to folks than at our own house ... so I'm not a huge fan of it, but boy it's glampy alright getting a hot shower every morning.    Ok, here's your first survival tip ... don't rely on fragile electronics for your survival purposes.    Ok, so while /u/maehren is pointing out all the advantages of GPS versus Smartphones, all of which are very legitimate points, I'll go ahead and argue against the need for GPS's at all.   If you're going backpacking in a large system of complex trails or a national forest or going out for several days in unfamiliar territory then and are hopeless with a map and compass than I think a GPS unit would be justifiable.   Just doing day jaunts through some State Parks though .. they are relatively small, typically have maps available at the check in, are relatively populated and thoroughly blazed.    I almost always have a map on me, but I rarely even have to break out the compass in most cases ... intersections, natural borders, manmade borders, basic terrain features and continuously knowing where I am have gotten me by quite handily for decades.   The one exception is when I'm fastpacking, and want accurate tracking of my distance and time (at this point I'm basically training, but in the woods) ... I'll bring my phone and use my running application to track my "hike".     Right, the one you linked is apparently 5cm thick ... and that information was only in the "details", not the main description which I suppose means they aren't exactly going for comfort.  As a thermal break, it's good, but if you're on in years or have any back issues you may be much happier off with a thicker one.   I use these, and am quite happy with both.  Despite having several back issues, they're quite comfortable for me, do quite well thermally (I've used one to 5 degrees F), and pack quite light and small, even into the smallest of packs.   http://www.rei.com/product/865695/nemo-cosmo-insulated-air-sleeping-pad  http://www.rei.com/product/846673/big-agnes-q-core-sl-sleeping-pad  I don't know what their availability and pricing would be in the EU, but I'd highly advise seeking similar ones out in shops and trying them out.  I too used a "thin" one (A ThermoRest) for years that provided "just" a thermal break, and suffered for years sleeping outdoors never realizing how well I could have been sleeping.     Thanks to these new thicker pads I now sleep as well outdoors as I do in my own bed.    What's all that clothing for ? Are you going camping or backpacking ? Are those pajamas ?    Depending on the weather and season BTW you could probably do without the sleeping bag.  Here in the Mid-Atlantic I'd say it's warm enough now to just use a liner and no longer haul the bag.    Concur.  That also looks like nylon rope- highly appropriate for marine use, but shite as general purpose cordage IMO.      Saying "bear" at the end is especially important if you're with/near other people so that they know what's going on  At first I thought this part was humour, but it actually makes a lot of sense, lest people think there's some sort of domestic dispute occuring in the campground !    Are Tomatoes rare in Germany ? Like once they were reserved for Royalty only ?    "best wingman ever" [fist bump]    hmmm. sounds like a potential IP infringement to me.    this is so right. i'm gonna post it on my FB.   J/K.   I find that consuming a high dose of protein right after my workout (like within 30 minutes) does quite a bit to prevent doms.    Amazon: $36.95+ $2.99 shipping.  This Massdrop seems like a pretty good deal relatively speaking.     Masterful formatting.  I can barely figure out how to do bullet points.     my old gym had the knee bench type.  My new one has a standing plate, so you have consistent resistance against it.  I like this new one much more.  It's considerably less awkward to use.    shit.  I hover between 209 lbs and 213 lbs, and I'm still doing weight assisted.  BUT, I'm doing 3 clean sets of 5, so there's that.  I have no shame though ... pullups are hard.    heh, if she's *anything* like my wife, you better just do whatever the hell she says if you know what's good for you.  You probably aren't working hard enough either ;)    In addition to the VA I'd also look for local resources available just as being citizens.  There may well be mental and physical advocacy groups and centres that could be of help.    thank you.    That's a pretty young vehicle IMO, but I've never spent a lot on vehicles.  I'd still take the question over to a car sub.   But then, if your wife wants a van, lets face it ... we all already know you're gonna get a van, like it or not.    	113
                      Good job at weighing out options I suppose, you get a vote.                            Prototype I understand, but you only need an air compressor and 4 minutes to fill up.                   Mp4                  Would it be good for example: streaming to four wireless devices in the car.       When I use hangouts I get a weird noise in the background everytime renders it basically useless.    Ouch, most have mentioned $100 tops so that really hurts.             He tried that last night, holding Pacquiaos head down and trying an uppercut but missed.                   He has lost in the Olympics.          Clinching, it's been around for ages.

    $5 / month   best price for HBO, ESPN, Netflix,   any other streaming service   couldn't they just check the server logs for gamertags?    When I got the XB1 at launch, I had some problems. Was speaking with a customer support specialist   they gave me some advice:  When installing a game from disc, disconnect from the network. If connected to network, the console will recognize the disc but install from their servers for newest version (if available).   If install from disc  way faster  (never tried it, I'm rocking disc-less)    My biggest complaint so far... it takes up space   distracts me from the screen. The HUD is pretty congested as is.    1) who can ever read those signs when they're being swung / spun around  2) do those signs ever draw in more than $8 in profits per hour (the cost of paying a sign person) to justify paying for it?    let's see: Xbox, then 3x for LAN parties, then PC, then Anniversary, then now...nope, 6th   There's a conversation I've had at least 8 times in my life. I meet someone   we talk about books. They say, "I love Stephen King", "He's my favorite writer",   sometimes "I've read everything he's written"  Then I reply, "How did you like the Dark Tower series?"  They say, "Oh, I haven't read that"  It's easily his best work. Book 1 was written early in his career (  re-written). It's Ok. Book 2 is better. Book 3 starts a great series. The fact it relates to other Stephen King books is only icing on the cake...   He was cocky. He let the crowd get in his head. He lost his cool / rhythm. The last play was supposed to center the game tying field goal (or throw out of bounds)   the kid blew it by not following the play.  The same punk that blew the egg bowl last year showed up last night...  Also, we need a RB who isn't 190 lbs. We called too many running plays (they weren't working).    millions of americans are tired of 'surviving' off less than a living wage.    yo momma so dumb, she got fired from the M M factory for throwing away the W's...  yo momma's so fat, she put a fridge on her hip   called it a beeper  (obviously from the 90's)   yo momma do dumb, she climbed a tree   applied to be branch manager        In 1999, a year before the 2000 election, I began tinkering with the idea of a site that would match a person with their best suggested politician.   The idea was to let a person take a political litmus test   get matched with a politician. It wouldn't be a social network (the user would have the same privacy you have in a voting booth). The test(s) would be as in depth as the user was willing to go. Daily quizzes / questionnaires / polls. The site would also link users to potential blogs, articles, resources, charities, or anything relative to the users interests.   I worked on this project for several years. I met with programmers, political science instructors, politicians, message boards, etc. The plan was to work on a major election (presidential)   work our way down to local level politics.  Then a couple years ago a programmer I had tried to enlist sent me this link. I knew instantly that someone had beaten me to the punch.   I recommend this site for anyone trying to make an informed decision. It's an excellent tool. I urge you not to vote with your gut. Don't blindly support one party. Don't vote based on income, class, etc. Don't make a decision as important a vote without some research. Hopefully this will help.          when wolvy comes back (  he will), he'll appear less 'Hugh Jackman'   more (insert next actor lined up to play him)...   If you melee them, they sometimes release a reward   I haven't seen any purple/yellow weapons in the post game for any of me or my teammates in the last 3 weeks.  But before that, every time I saw one was when it was given to the worst player on the team...   Been a XBOX Live member since launch  Been a rewards member since launch  Got a XBOX One at launch  Where's my reward?    in perspective, it's nice to see where my money   time has been spent for the past decade...   it would be great if in the new trilogy, someone uses the cloning tech to clone Raven/Malak expecting them to be a Sith apprentice...    Guess the Win 9 is going to be free rumors are true?    never noticed how much that ship looks like a huge rifle...    if Bungie wasn't so vague with the story...   Honest question...    well put. I 100% agree with you: getting tired of replaying this game, having to  'work' to get stuff (I say work, because it's taking up a lot of my time), which is common of MMOs...  But: compare Destiny to Halo (what we primarily know Bungie for):  The Destiny story has more play ability than any Halo campaign. I usually play a Halo campaign once on Legendary co-op, another solo Legendary,   usually various sittings to get achievements. We can up the difficulty to Destiny's missions (not different, but harder) but we could also add skulls to Halo missions.   Since launch, I've played Destiny's story more than any Halo campaign (  I'm a pretty huge Halo fan)   it's only been a couple of weeks. But, I'm tiring of it. I'm eager to anything new: DLC, missions, etc... After one week of playing, I had completed the story   then the level 20 'work' started.   So far, we got 4 (large) Forge worlds (with AI spawns)   a tower map.   Next, Multiplayer: Halo's MP has always been the true replay value. Destiny's MP is OK. Vehicles are terrible. Destiny's MP is fun, but the only purpose is to get Crucible points   perhaps upgrades. (When MCC comes, I can't imagine Destiny will be in my sights)  So far, I would say I've already gotten my $60 out of Destiny, but I too thought there would be more content.   Good luck with the fanboys. They are the ones that think they speak for Bungie (speak for yourselves you sheep!).  I, too, worry about the Activision connection. Surly (not Shirley) Bungie took the preventable measures. Activision has a rep of nickel   diming us to death   taking IPs away from publishers.      Also: something we found out last night: have someone go up on the highest platform across from where you enter   die. The swarm of wizards will stay up there   attack the dead body (allowing the other 2 members a chance to focus on Phogoth)   where's the pic?     simple click with the stick would be a great feature   One thing to do: if the Knights aren't attacking you   you aren't out of ammo, don't attack. Focus your attack on Phogoth. If you clear out the Knights, there's only more behind them...   when you get into a long battle, the music eventually becomes overbearingly annoying    Destiny is vague. I understand it adds to mystery, but it's so minimally cryptic it's kinda aggravating. I'll play the hell out of it, I'm appreciative, but I've spent a week playing a game I don't understand at all.   Halo has always had a ton of story stuff in the background. There's been origins. There's been viral ads that add to the lore. Bungie has out Bungie'd themselves.   I thought I was lost to Titanfall's story...    nobody ever feigned outrage over Bush W. it was genuine. there wasn't speculation, it was grounded in facts. nobody imagined that he was born in a far away land (although he actually wasn't from Texas). fear-mongering is all about 'what ifs'. the GOP is all about imagining what they are up against.   the democrats are for policy where as GOP is for philosophy http://www.vox.com/2014/9/15/6131919/democrats-and-republicans-really-are-different  one party is attracted to tangible results   the other is attracted to something in their gut. what is it with the GOP   them not believing in science, facts, or anything laid out in front of them in favor of made up hypothesis or religion?   they're not focused on helping the people the people who elected them so much as they are on getting their way (  staying in power). they'd rather monkeywrench DC for 2 Obama terms than do a job. come 2016, they're hoping voters blame Obama for their lack of attention. they'll do anything to win an election EXCEPT have a proven track record   run an honest campaign...all at the expense of the public.    BTW: we now call it drone parenting     I wish there was a list sorted by release date (known publicly available), not by type. This way, we could keep up with which ones have been entered...

The best was in Halo 2. You'd creep up to a base   you could listen to the dolts dicking around on defense. If you outnumbered them, you could start telling them how you were going to steal their flag   they should come out with their hands up...      the first time I trolled the internet, I found a Friends text only board   commented that 'Rachael has the hardest working nipples in the business'...  I got banned.    I used to live down the street from the Jehovah Witness 'church'. Every Saturday morning, a group of little ole ladies would walk out to convert but would always go straight to my house. (never a different neighborhood...)  Usually, I would have bartended till very late Friday night   would come home after the bar closed   would pass out playing video games somewhere around dawn on the couch. Around 8am, they'd knock, I'd have to put on pants   hear their spill about their faith. I'd smile, take their pamphlet (while my Jack Russell would be begging to eat them up at my feet),   go immediately back to sleep....  BUT: after 10 times, I decided to skip the pants   straight up answer the door in my boxers... it was half way through their speech when I noticed my morning wood had made it out the tent   was distracting them.   They never came back.      http://www.clublexus.com/forums/attachments/car-chat/109827d1187246100-the-official-car-of-viagra-a-and-g.jpg   	44
    Holy cow!  What are your favorite parts about it?  I saw it once and I didn't plan on seeing it again   I think the best way to listen to this album is exactly as the title suggests:  on random!  For some reason I get tired listening to the album in the proper order.  I simply expect and anticipate which song is coming next.  Partially because there is long silence between the songs.  However, putting it on random not only surprises me with which songs come on the stereo but also with how they sound.  Songs that I got used to after a long time sound fresh and different.  I like listening to their albums usually all the way straight through but with RAM I get tired of the general arc.  The album progresses from disco songs about the dance floor, loneliness, weariness, and sadness (the party lifestyle) to songs about hope, looking beyond, and rising above the world (the transcendent lifestyle).  At least that's the way I see it.  And it's a good arc, but it all seems divided right down the middle by "Touch" and I get the general flow of both sides of the record after a while.  So anyway for me putting it on random gives it a new spin.  I'd love to hear other people talk about how they listen to the music and what sort of themes they see in the different albums.   Wow that's sweet! Did you make that just on your phone?  There's an app for that, right?   I think it's hard to say if a film is rewatchable when it just came out last year.  How many times have you seen Captain America: Winter Soldier?  North by Northwest is my favorite rewatchable film personally and I've seen it about ten times.  My second favorite is Raiders of the Lost Ark and I've seen it about eight times.  It helps that those movies are from a long time ago, because any instant "cool" factor or shock value they could have had back then is long gone, leaving only the heart and integrity of the movie.   Pulp Fiction doesn't rely entirely on the "wow" factor of intertwining stories, although most Christopher Nolan movies do.  I wish Christopher Nolan had more moments that were interesting in themselves, not just interesting in how they play into the rest of the movie.  For example, the toaster pastry scene in Pulp Fiction is very clever and something that you would have a hard time finding in a Christopher Nolan movie.  Nolan has a hard time just letting a moment relax by itself; even the neat hallway rotating scene in Inception is intercut with several other scenes to increase the "impact" in a very unnecessary way.  I feel like Nolan is a Sundance director on steroids.  He focuses mostly on characters and initial shock value to please his audience.  Thus his movies get a lot of buzz on release but have a harder time remaining relevant and enjoyable over time.   I watched this movie at the Chinese Theater a week after it came out and they started playing the IMAX film upside down.  It was pretty hilarious, especially after a spiel about how Christopher Nolan had personally examined every frame of the film.     For starters you should read the full chapter of "Autobiography of a Yogi" that Scott is quoting from.  I wonder if the words missing were omitted on purpose or were just garbled up in the static of the night 5 phone call.  Anyway the whole chapter is really interesting because it mentions how everything has a "life force" including metals and plants... perfect evil scientist material.    I wonder if the purple Freddy suit is a metaphor for the Golden Freddy suit when it was/is inhabited by the purple man.  I'd imagine that he cannot dismantle or disarm the robots while in the suit and so he leaves it for greater mobility, speed, and motor skills.  The reason why he goes to the safe room is so that the robots will give up pursuit and turn around, giving him a chance to attack from behind.  The newspaper clippings from the first game are really interesting too, that's what got me started on the "mad scientist" theory.  Here was a post I made on the subject a while ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/2wh7qu/why_did_he_kill/  I want to beat the secret mini games for myself but I haven't done that yet.  I don't understand why giving the dead kids cake helps free them...  Every mini game takes place in the perspective of either a robot or a previously-robot dead kid, so it tells us how the robot characters see the world and interact with it.  Maybe the "glitches" represent some sort of supernatural transcendence... like the robots have to go to the underworld to save the kids or something.   I think the Night 5 secret call is helpful:    "It is lamentable that mass agricultural development is not speeded by fuller use of your marvelous mechanisms. Would it not be easily possible to employ some of them in quick laboratory experiments... Countless uses will be made by future generations."    So there's "potential" for these robots besides being basic animatronics.    Maybe he takes the robots apart in the mini games because he feels guilty and afraid of his creations and hopes to put them to rest.  Unfortunately, the souls of the kids refuse to go away and he ironically is forced into the suit.  As for why the souls don't leave the animatronics, I think of the classic ghost cliche of improper burials and unnatural deaths leading to hauntings.  Think "Poltergeist" -- ghosts haunting a house because it has been built on their burial grounds.  So when he takes apart the animatronics, the animatronics are no longer coffins for the kids.  They are free, but in the "Bad Ending" they still haunt the area and only in the "Good Ending" are they free from Freddy Fazbear's.  As for how the marionette fits into all of it, you've got me beat.   I always thought that he was attempting to give the animatronics life by killing the kids.  What if he isn't against the company but is actually trying to make more money by creating robots with personality?      I love that one the way it currently is too... I guess I am a sucker for the classic woodie experience and I don't want it to be replaced everywhere.   I love that one as it is and hope they don't change it   A friend sent me this website and I couldn't believe that I had never heard of it before!  I love his attention to detail and psychological analysis.      I didn't take the beef jerky.  I paid for the two cookies, the first one had gotten stuck!      Why and how   I left the jerky in the machine because I felt guilty      I do :(         Throw down for what?   Bump what?      For some reason I thought it was the Blue Ball Machine music at the beginning https://youtu.be/KVdqwD_bcPs?t=1m14s   This is why movies should use more practical effects and miniatures   So great   Also doesn't help that many of the heads are now looking at you   I still think that's the scariest part of the whole series.           I was 5 and I thought Thunder Mountain Railroad was just another train ride.  Boy was I wrong!   I've beat every other mode on mobile but Golden Freddy mode is practically impossible.  Toy Bonnie and Foxy are the ones that get me every time, one or the other...   I like that movie a lot   3spoopy5me   "You watch robots.  Robots watch you."   Go Biola   Really glad I got to ride it   You can open the reboot panel and close it, Foxy is not triggered until you turn back to the right   It's fake   That's awesome!   And he's looking right at me the whole time.  Great   I always hate trying to find him when it's just an arm or a leg in the far corner of the screen   What did the tickets look like?

 No, he doesn't. If he looks underage and is purchasing alcohol that is absolutely probable cause to detain them and ascertain their age.     He doesn't need a stop and identify law if he sees them purchasing alcohol and believes them to be underage.    He lets them go through with it because he cannot prove that they aren't 21  He can ask for their ID right then and there.   You can always refuse a search.

Your wife disappears for 48 hours, and you have not yet contacted authorities, when most people would do it within a few hours.  You haven't contacted her friends and family to ask if they've seen her or to let them know there's a problem.  Even now, you plan to contact police "tomorrow morning" waiting yet another 12 hours for no reason whatsoever.  Before contacting police, however, your main concern is to avoid suspicion on yourself.  You're asking about procedural questions for talking to police when for all you know your wife could be kidnapped, injured, or worse.  You demonstrate no concern for her safety whatsoever, only concern for yourself.   He is a traitor that revealed state secrets for 15 minutes of fame.

An infant, which looks very different than a grown person, made you think about how porn actresses look young?   My daughter's vulva looks nothing like a grown woman's.  I have never conflated the two.   You can get the video through a records request or through the normal discovery process.  There is usually a fee for such things.   Abuse of legal painkillers is absolutely a huge problem.  That doesn't answer my question of why telling someone not to do illegal drugs is a bad message?   She is being sued by the other driver, not the driver's insurance company.  She needs to contact the insurance company she had at the time and inform them of the lawsuit.  They will provide an attorney for her and defend her up to the limits of her policy.    "DONT DO DRUGS"  I think the vast majority of people understand this to refer to illegal drugs.  How is that not a good message?   Just act like a normal person man.  You'll be fine.   Would I have a case if I tried to lawyer up and take them to court?  Please don't say lawyer up.   It's unlikely any attorney would take this case on contingency, meaning you'd have to pay them a retainer that would likely be more than it would cost you to get the car painted.   It's also unlikely that you'll get an entirely new paint job because they can't match the paint in the back. I don't think any judge or jury would see such a thing as reasonable.     Why should I be forced to write him a new check?  Because you're an adult. Act like it.     nudum pactum  I had a lot of those back in high school.   He's been staying with the permission of the friend making the friend the landlord subletting the place.    If nothing else you are absolutely guilty of refusing to blow into the Breathalyzer at the station which is going to be a 1 year suspension of your license.   5 years   Take that deal. You're going to lose your motion and your trial. We told you that last time.    The issue will turn on whether or not the judge thinks you were living at one place or another. The fact that you told the police officer one thing means the judge will likely lean that way.    I'm not sure if I'm correctly understanding, but even if you don't plan to live somewhere forever, if you're there for as long as you were that is your residence and you need to update your information. Usually you have 30 days after you move to do so.    If it's necessary for the officer to be there, he will be.  The idea that you can somehow wait it out in the hopes that he won't show is largely a myth.   Delaying won't work.  If it did everyone would just delay their court hearings.  You have no defense so far as I can see.  You can go to your court date and speak with the prosecutor.  The only plea you're likely to be offered is Unsafe Driving, which carries no points but is a $400-$500 fine.    I was going to sell my car since the tickets are only associated with the license plate not my driver's license number.   It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to find you.    I mean GE is able to not pay a dime in taxes, because they have the right argument, the right loophole, no?  [GE pays taxes.](http://www.factcheck.org/2012/04/warren-ge-pays-no-taxes/)    But "not buying it" isn't what I'm interested in hearing about.  Well, you get what you pay for.  Why, specifically, wouldn't this argument hold up?  Because your scheme, and it's obvious that's what this is, would not hold up under the law.  Even if you had some argument that would pass the laugh test, which you don't, the human beings that interpret and enforce these laws would see right through you.   But if the exact content of the receipt is necessary for the work of art, and it would be impossible to obtain a legitimate receipt for that amount from that store (its legitimacy is also necessary), doesn't it follow that I necessarily had to have purchased that item, and therefore it is a legitimate expense in regards to the art piece?  The resounding "no" remains.  No one will fall for this.  The IRS won't buy it, a judge won't buy it, a jury won't buy it.  It won't work.    I didn't say false accusations happen with regularity. I said drunk sex happens with regularity  I know what you said.  My point was that even with all that regular drunk sex happening, false rape accusations do not happen with regularity.  So they don't need to worry about it.    I get what you are saying but the reality is that on college campuses sex with strangers is a regularity.   False rape accusations do NOT happen with regularity.  If you're concerned about it that much, only have sex with people you trust.  Don't have a one night stand.   They need a safe space to call children crotchfruit.       There is no private claim for a FERPA violation.     Shouldn't a person be aware that he is doing wrong?  I find it hard to believe that you didn't know you were not allowed to waltz into any open building you see, in the middle of the night, and destroy their property.    A burglar and a felon or a person that was a trouble maker would have had a prior history as a juvenile delinquent.  False. Plus your history has nothing to do with whether or not you committed this crime.    It creates an attorney client relationship which should be avoided here at all costs.   I've never seen anything like this happen before.    When asked why he decided not to arrest a felon in possession of a firearm  The prosecutor didn't object since this was entirely irrelevant?  actually discretely gave us the thumbs up while arranging some paperwork.  Uhhhhhh  after the cop testified they knew there was no way that proper procedure had been followed  Had they followed their instructions they should have disregarded this testimony entirely since it has nothing to do with the actual charge.   After the verdict we got to speak to several members of the jury.  Maybe it's different in Wyoming but his would never happen in any jurisdiction I'm familiar with.    Aaron Sorkin is the best TV writer in history.  Come at me bro.    From my understanding, as the custodial parent the minimum parenting time is the only thing she has to agree to, and the judge will not force anything other than that unless the parents have a joint custody agreement, which requires agreement from both parties at least initially, which she will not agree to.   Your understanding is incorrect.    it's whether the doctor violated a standard of car  Like when you clearly tell the rental place you want an SUV and they give you a Dodge Neon.   Compazine is also used to treat migraine headaches.   they are not meant to foreclose the parents from agreeing to, ***or the court from granting***, such additional or reduced parenting time as may be in the best interest of the child in any given case.  The court will not grant you the minimum time and there's no reason for you to assume to.    If she decides that she cant/wont then I am only entitled to non-custodial legal minimum.  What makes you think this?  There is no law that I know of that states anything close to this.   She can't do that.  She's not the one in the control of the situation, the judge is.  She doesn't get to decide how much time you get.  A judge will almost certainly award joint custody, since that's what they almost always do.  Additionally, as the primary care giver you have an excellent argument to have primary physical custody.  If you want to do this right you need an attorney.   If you were fired due to economic conditions then you have no recourse. You would have to prove somehow that your religious views were the cause-and it would take more than the timing of your firing to do so.    You're right bro. Fight the power!!    Touch.   	75
 I see a business opportunity. Fat camp for adults.    4$ a gallon fuel?  Sign me up any day. I'd buy a barrel to burn it for laughs. We paid between 7 and 8 us per gallon where I live.    VW Polo Bluemotion,  but this will change to a VW Golf Bluemotion next month. This has a 1.6 4 cylinder diesel with an average use of 5.07l/100km.   Practically for me this will be an average of 4.3l/100km due to my driving style (boring).    It's pretty good in the city,  highways are decent. It's comfortable up to 140 km/h. It will run 170 real (gps)  km/h when I push it. Fuel economy goes to about 11liters per 100km then   Calling /r/keto!    One of my best friends is quite the athlete and has a resting BPM of about 35. He was hospitalised for something unrelated.   They ended up disconnecting the heart rate monitor because it kept giving alarms...    "Mourn harder or we kill your family."   True story.    There is a /r/writingprompt about exactly that. I'm on mobile and can't find it. The premise of one story is actually very very clever.    Instead poverty for all!    1.2 liter 3 cylinder in my car. I could have bought a bigger car with a fatter engine,  but there is no point. No kids,  no huge distances,  and it's very economic to drive. Safe too, 5 star euro ncap.    Small displacement diesel engine. Cheap as shit.  Prius has NOTHING on the fuel economy of this car.   Prius has a real use of 5.18liters average per 100km (n=2095) My car has 4.61liters average per 100km (n=114)  Source spritmonitor.de   People need to get the idea out of their heads that hybrids are fuel economic.   A Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV has a 30km range on the battery. Then it does about 7.32 liters per 100km on fuel.    Western European tax paradise (tax paradise for the government that is).    100 quadrillion extra.    You used the wrong subreddit. This belongs in /r/nottheonion.    No austerity will bankrupt them with national poverty as a result. 5% is the lesser of two evils.    Entry: 500 quadrillion dollars.    For me driving is only about 6 euro cents a kilometer in fuel. The rest of the cost is about 23 cents. Insurance,  road tax,  maintenance,  depreciation,  tires,  etc. People seem to forget about that.   Imagine I go to my bank after I cannot pay my monthly mortgage and ask them for a loan.   They'd throw me out laughing.  Greece is delusional.   Syriza:  [**Ideology** ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriza)  * Democratic socialism * Left-wing populism * Eco-socialism * Anti-capitalism * Alter-globalization * Soft euroscepticism  The are also formed out of far left and radical left.  Pretty much the furthest left you can get in modern politics.  Stop being an apologist nitwit and go bother someone else.   Then again Mugabe is like " You party, or you die."   I know man. Back To The Future lied to us. We should have flying cars this year.    The worst is when they decide to go out after the party, without telling you, claiming they are going home.  That was the end of 6 friendships for me in my college days.   Reactor vessels for the chemical industry.      Pao:    Support me or get sacked.  No wonder the full team is "behind her". I'd be too with this terror in the hallway.   "Alex, I'll have things that sand for 120".   As you have already lost any sense of credibility I will leave you with a quote from George Carlin   'Never argue with an idiot. They will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience.'  And on that bombshell, I bid you adieu.   Yep. I feel kind of bad for the "common Greek". First they (and the rest of Europe) got scammed into the Euro by fraudulent bookkeeping.  Then everything went to crap after which they elect a government so extremely far to the left that they will never resolve anything with the EU.  Then they get tricked into a false sense of importance by a referendum that is less useful than a car without wheels.  Now they party, while their entire nation goes to shit.   Please note   For example, there is a tradition in many newsgroups and other Internet discussion forums that once such a comparison is made, the thread is finished and whoever mentioned the Nazis has automatically lost whatever debate was in progress.[8] This principle is itself frequently referred to as Godwin's law.   Your the weakest link. Goodbye.   Now they party. Soon they will cry and be hungry.  How can an entire nation be so short sighted?   [Check and mate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law)   Worst thing is, the EU will probably give it in fear of Uncle Vladimir Putin and Uncle Xi Jinping coming with a fat sack of cash.  That or Greece destabilising and becoming a stepping stone for middle eastern radicals (heck maybe even Khalif Erdogan wants to have a go)   I used to be a pretty chunky guy and in Japan I found the most perfect t-shirt.  It said " Laugh and be Fat". I wore that sucker with pride.   It's about 5 sized too big now though, so I got that going for me.   Lucky you. Shirataki noodles are like 3$ a pack here.   Hey everyone,   Can someone please get me in contact with the Nobel Prize comity? This guy just permanently solved all the worlds unemployment issues!  His glorious solution "Someone else will hire them!".  You saw it here first, on reddit!    Man, you are delusional. Grow up.   [Check, and Mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law)   Greece would to well to make their country a good place to settle as a company. Make labour laws more entrepreneur friendly, reduce the ridiculous worker rights the Greek people have been giving themselves (really, it's out of hand). Make it a beneficial place tax wise (corporate taxes hardly matter, give people money and they will spend, tax income), give away lands for FREE or very cheap to businesses willing to settle (happened a lot in the Netherlands in the 80's and 90's for example).  Of course the government only goes so far. The Greek workers need to understand that they are not all little saints with rights that others would dream off. Yes, you are important, yes you need to do your part. Take your loss, help start building your country.   Oh yes, I'll tell the guys on the work floor that we are laying them off in an already hard industry. Luckily they get a few months of unemployment benefits (60% pay) and then welfare because the EU and Putin have a squabble, I'm sure they'll understand when they are unable to become employed in their field as our economy is also on it's ass.  It's easy to talk when you are employed and largely unaffected.      Sound like you want unemployment and poverty.   Loaning money doesn't work like that. And the Greeks need to understand.  "Forgive old loans and give us new loans." basically translates to   "Forgive old loans and give us free money that you will never get back."   A better compromise would be (which I still don't stand behind, but still)  "Forgive us part of our old loans and invest in our economy so we can move forward".   A long time ago during my bachelor studies I was in a project group named "Trade not Aid"  where we helped European companies invest in Africa. No free money, no loans. Setting up businesses and letting the locals make money. It worked very, very well.       In my opinion the referendum is just there to make the people think they have a say in this. They do not. Every single action so far has been in the direction of "We need more money, we promise to pay it back, also lend us more money so we can pay back the previous lender." It's like a pyramid scheme on national level.  What the Greek people and government need to do it turn very frugal, start to learn to live on the welfare level they can afford. Reform the economy (I mean, really, what does Greece have? Tourism and limited agriculture?). Exploit upcoming markets. They have tons of sun and wind, become the number one net exported of Green energy in the world. I'm sure that the EU would be willing to help pay for that. Create the best damn tourist place to be you can. Last time I was on holiday in Greece it was terrible, I would not return. etc etc.  Go frugal, live a life that you can actually afford, reform, create a unique selling point. It is hard, and I certainly do not know HOW they should do it, these are just my ideas, take them for what you will.   Talk about making false promises!   I used to be a very vocal "Grexit" proponent. But I feel more and more pity for the Greek people.  It's all a giant clusterfuck of failure. First politicians scammed the people and the EU into joining the Euro. Then everything goes to shit. Then they elect a government  that cannot possibly solve this issue.   We (the EU) should have let Greece go years ago. It would have been cheaper for the EU, and less painful for the Greek people. The bitter pill would be there, but a whole lot less bitter than it is now.\  My guess: Grexit before the end of the year with very limited impact to Europe, and near third world levels of poverty in Greece.   Regardless of Siemens, this is pretty common for a lot of firms. One of our biggest customers is in Russia.   Fortunately we have a joint venture in China. We ship the 99.9% ready product to them. They tack on some extra nameplates and upload the software (made in the EU) and ships to Russia.  And believe me, we are not the only ones. For us it is either this, or close one of our factories, firing approx. 500 employees, our margins are already razor thin as it is due to competition from lower cost countries.  The only ones that are screwed by this are smaller companies, farmers, and other agricultural companies.   Never had the urge to decrease DPI, so no worries.

                   Given our societies and living conditions are constantly changing, I don't think our on-Earth problems will ever be 'solved'. Plus things don't have to be dealt with one at a time                     His appointment on such a board should be illegal. It's like making a massive racist the minister for equality (UK position - please insert local equivalent!)   There's been a lot of negativity about this technology, but at the end of the day it has got to be being built, which is a lot more than can be said for a lot of environmentally friendly tech. It will be really interesting to see how it works in reality.    I believe [this is the article](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-04/scientists-reverse-ageing-process-in-mice/5865714) you were looking for - you're correct about it being the muscles:  "We've discovered genes that control how the body fights against ageing and these genes, if you turn them on just the right way, they can have very powerful effects, even reversing ageing - at least in mice so far," he said. "We fed them a molecule that's called NMN and this reversed ageing completely within just a week of treatment in the muscle, and now we're looking to reverse all aspects of ageing if possible."    I'm afraid I'm not the creator - I just thought this was a cool project. You make a solid point though.   Customers pay to have a Cloud Heat fire-proof cabinet installed in their homes or offices (the cost is comparable to installing a standard heating system). Then Cloud Heat pays for the electricity and Internet service the cabinet needs and the owner gets to enjoy free heat and hot water.  Not a bad deal                     A BSc in History actually sounds like an awesome course - I'm imagining modules on 16th century theories that have long been disproved.    Once 3D metal printing gets good/cheap enough, maybe a metal version will be doable, which i assume would be stronger   I'm not sure if its about fat so much as about hand size - people that work with their hands and so have a lot of callouses etc seem to have more trouble. My Dad is a good example - he works with his hands a lot so his fingers are far too big to use a smartphone properly, but he isn't particularly fat.                                                                This type of approach to tackling insect-borne diseases is pretty exciting - I hope it proves successful   I agree with this - a party would alienate the movement from other potentially sympathetic parties in a way that a lobby would not.                     Aren't these technically wave turbines not wind turbines?   You might be able to adapt [solar tube technology](http://www.solatube.co.uk/) to solve this problem      Mine is February 28. I am now utterly curious about what would have happened if last year was a leap year and I'd signed up one day later. Would I have one cake day every 4 years?               Wouldn't this be exceptionally expensive to implement?   That is an excellent point                     That's hard to say, because it is the decision of each publisher if they want to port it. If it becomes as popular as Zuckerberg wants it to be, though, I'm sure plenty of publishers will embrace the format      sorry i think i must be having an idiot day, will delete now            If you watch TV in the UK you have to pay for a TV licence, which funds the BBC. So its like HBO except you have to get it.    You had me at "IQ of a toothbrush"               Or write headlines that make the author sound sane            What kind of thing does one need to do to get a ban on Facebook? I've never heard of that happening before                           Ah I see! Thanks for the explanation.   I thought the research in this article was interesting because of the potential for average joes - they often get the short straw on this sub!   I cannot upvote this enough. Time and time again people on this sub have declared a technology developed outside the US will never work, often because of a legal or infrastructure issue that is only a problem in the US. It's close-minded madness.    Yes! Once in a blue moon I encounter a company that does this and they are gods in my eyes.   It's weirdly more common to find them in alphabetical order, including an array of countries that are clearly never going to be needed, such as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.      This has gone completely over my head. Would you mind explaining, please?                                          I quite agree, although he was not the first and he won't be the last to put forward that idea   I can understand your concern, but if he fired you for requesting hot water you could take him to court for unfair dismissal. At least mention it to your colleagues so they are aware too!    People who do this fill me with a quiet fury                           What kind of thing should they be trying instead?   [This website](https://plentific.com/buying-process/) may also be worth reading - its a very thorough guide to buying a house in the UK that should provide some useful info                              Is this aimed at me or the writer?

 If Georgetown is dead, it's dying by growing. The Georgetown Metropolitan reported that the number businesses in its downtown is now at 508, which compares to 496 from last year.  http://georgetownmetropolitan.com/2014/03/24/the-state-of-georgetown-2014/   This ought to be required reading by every police officer in Connecticut.    They are promising to run the bus 3 to 7 minutes during peak, and 12-15 minutes off-peak.   This project has gotten and will obviously continue to get a lot of skepticism. With the exception of Metro North, Connecticut has never been a mass transit state. It hasn't done as much as it should be doing for bicycles, either.   So, I agree with the idea that you have to sell this. Not just the idea of using this system, but the entire idea of using mass transit.   If it succeeds, it might help refocus economic development back to urban cores, particularly in New Britain and Hartford. It might spur housing and entertainment districts along key parts of the route. It wouldn't surprise me at all if it reshapes New Park Ave. in a positive way.   The Hartford/New Britain region once had mass transit: A great trolley system. It replaced it with buses which suffered in the   two-car per household era. But Connecticut residents are smart, adaptive and responsible, and in this era of climate change, expensive fuel, more interest in bicycle commuting and mass transit, this project may work.   I get the concern that ridership will fall short. But city after city is putting in some kind of mass transit option. Trolleys are making a comeback, dedicated bus and bicycle lanes are arriving as people fight the idea of using streets for "car storage" i.e. parking. There's always push back, but you need to ask: Why won't something like this work?   This CTfastrak is a done deal at this point. The investment has been made. Here's hoping for a good outcome.    what are the property taxes?    thanks for links but still have no idea what this is about. is there a link to the blog? or a backgrounder story on the suit?       I couldn't believe it. TBS gets to broadcast a final four game and decides to tell the game from one perspective: the Gators. It wasn't just the announcers. The camera was fixed on the Florida bench and its coach. Terrible.    If you're in NB at all, Jimmy's Smoke Shop in downtown is the HQ for bus transport.    I think it's something that could work well with something else. Take a look at http://www.everyblock.com/ It aggregates in news, public records, anything it can find by location. But interest in it is so-so. Everyblock's approach, when all is said and done, doesn't offer much. People want original content, discussion, and something they can't find elsewhere. Pure aggregation tools, unattached from anything else, just haven't caught on all that well. They don't inspire a lot of loyalty or repeat traffic.   Redditt, Slashdot aggregate but users pick the content, not software. There's a difference.   But I think the fact that you have created this platform is a significant accomplishment and it has potential, but not necessarily as a stand-alone platform.   This blogger reported on her experience. http://wishiknewdc.com/?p=121   The bill has 13 Republican co-sponsors, and 7 Democratic co-sponsors.   http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2413/cosponsors   Ok, technically it's a "Republican bill." But it has 13 Republican co-sponsors and 7 Democratic co-sponsors, which seems like a pretty high percentage of Democrats for a "Republican bill."   http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2413/cosponsors          Is it criminally negligent to choose to be willfully ignorant of the truth?    For starters, let's build a Manhattan Project around batteries, Renewable energy needs cheaper, cost effective, high capacity storage, and so do electric cars.   Here's another: Great strides are being made to improve solar photoelectric cells. Would adding $26B in federal support speed up their development?  Removing C02. I have no faith that mankind will react in time to reduce CO2 levels. Can we develop technologies that can do this and make it as ubiquitous as trees?   Federal research is increasing only incrementally. It may not be beating inflation at this point, and is declining in some areas, so I wouldn't hold out on a Manhattan Project anytime soon. Of course, Europe and China may see it differently and discover ways to improve energy storage. That will be good for mankind, but bad for U.S. industries.      You are assuming that I tried to time the market in the past. Never have. I haven't touched by investment spread is 15 years. This is not about timing the market.  I'm just trying to make a decision about whether it's time to bail from the market, lock-in what I saved, and move on. Very hard decision. I wanted to see what people think.   Oh, and regarding mother earth. They were right then, and they are most definitely right now.        I have about 30% international; about 30% in U.S. stocks large and small, moderate risk; and the balance in bonds   I'm in my late 50s, and I'm wondering if I should park my 401K funds in a stability of principal fund.   Market Watch recently had a piece warning that "Stock caution urged as margin debt levels hit new highs" http://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-caution-urged-as-margin-debt-levels-hit-new-highs-2014-03-09  And the Financial Times has a piece today that Seth Klarman is warning of a "significant market correction." He is citing nosebleed valuations in tech shares, in particular. http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/6dd806e2-a627-11e3-9818-00144feab7de.html#axzz2vYeDNzjM  The Bull Market is five years old, and while some argue that it will go on for a while, there is someone arguing that things will remain good for a while. People were saying the housing market would stay good right up until the time it crashed in 2008. This time, I'm inclined to agree with the bears.   I'm not 401K rich by a long shot, so not much room to play. Should I park?    I really like the Guardian. The climate change reporting and analysis is really good. They are aggressive and right on top the story. They take issue seriously, and they don't give harbor to the skeptics (unlike so many major U.S. newspapers). Most importantly, they devote resources to the issues.  What can U.S. news organizations learn from the Guardian?  Quite a lot I suspect. People want in-depth coverage of climate change without the BS from the skeptics.    I had posted a direct link to Krauthammer's post earlier on reddit climate and it was down voted to oblivion. It was worth taking note, IMHO, because it was in the Washington Post, and it will be read by the large denial contingent in Congress. The real issue is whether the Washington Post should have published Krauthammer's shallow thinking.             I think I know what you mean. If you ask people with only a passing knowledge of climate change whether they notice changes in the weather, you will often hear how "weird" it is. But this awareness that something is amiss has not yet boiled over to the point where they are concluding that we're in deep trouble. So, yes, is the weird weather keeps up, the boiling point will be reached ....       This belongs here. The story is solid. The OP's write-up is based on something in the piece i.e. "crack squad of fairies," that's a little over-the-top sarcasm.   The Guardian piece is about the poor reading comprehension and lack of scientific understanding in journalism. The idea that there was a hiatus or pause in global warming was never an accurate description of what's going on. That seems to be the major point.     Brad Field. But in truth, all the local weather folks are good. They all work hard at it.    Seriously, is that what its come down to? Admiring some run-of-the mill windows?      It humanizes Barry Farms and the issue generally, and it's a great example of local reporting. That's why it's being voted down, and, of course, to support gentrification.    I thought this quote in the story was particularly interesting.  "Technological superiority is not assured," Kendall told the Armed Services Committee in the House of Representatives. "This is not a future problem. This is a here-now problem."  Can imagine that a similar warning was raised during the Soviet era. What was the response then, versus the response now?          It's probably important to point out those connected to political power and money who deny climate change. But the only reason these people and organizations flourish is because most Americans are in denial (as opposed to deniers) about climate change.    It's clever. It's different and it's true.    Totally support everything Mann is saying. But it applies to everyone who understands this issue.    It's a good thing Reddit doesn't apply the is he/she "an actual person" standard to redditors.    Yes, but at least you aren't living in Honolulu. Be thankful!   Its been just a few months since I came to Los Angeles from the District of Columbia, and already it is Crystal City clear: L.A. is a downer.  Look no further then Skidrow at 7 a.m. for a pure view into the citys heart and soul. You will pass a dozens and dozens of slumped homeless veterans holding out a McDonalds cup for money.   After committing to pay a senseless amount of money for gas for the day's trip just to dump ever increasing amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere; it's easy going from here, except for the climate-changed induced drought emergency just declared by the governor.   Every morning its the same on the Freeway: people, sitting in their cars, with blank stares and the saddest-looking faces imaginable. Do they wonder about the environment? They are like cattle in a climate denial storm, too self-centered to take mass transit, gazing into space, waiting for their ride to the climate change slaughter house.  A rat creeps across a sidwalk. The dusty cars make a miserable sound as they screech to a stop.  I don't see E.T. anywhere. I am miserable, disappointed. Where are the starlets? Everywhere in Los Angeles you see people in T-Shirts and jeans. I miss D.C.'s civilizing dress code.  The irony runs deep. The capital of American media culture  is in fact, ugly and uninspiring. The imagine of L.A. as a colorful mecca of entertainment is a lie. The citizens who work in the movie and television industry appear to be enduring unspeakable oppression and Oscar snubs.  Please, California people, keep your mouths shut when you visit D.C. Don't write trite op-eds. Instead, keep your eyes fixed on whatever little video screen you can find. And when you return to California, preach the merits of mass transit and car-less living.         We need to free the dinosaurs. The idea of holding animals in captivity bothers me. There's plenty of room on the Mall for the dinosaurs to roam. Let's free them!     Well, if that's true then Alabama is the best state in the country.       I wish the critter well. May he continue to out-fox the Capitol police.       What isn't attributed to climate change?    There is evidently an effort to ban ecigarettes on the Metro and other public places.  There was a hearing in November. Smoke Free DC testified. The testimony: http://www.smokefreedc.org/e-cigarette-testimony-dc-council/  Hearing notice and backgrounder on proposed law: http://dccouncil.us/events/health-hearing-on-bill-20-233-the-electronic-cigarette-parity-amendment-act  From what I can tell, this bill has not been adopted. Here is the legislative status page:  http://dcclims1.dccouncil.us/lims/legislation.aspx?LegNo=B20-0233  Here is the bill, the oddly named, Electronic Cigarette Parity Amendment Act of 2013  http://www.dccouncil.us/files/user_uploads/related_materials/Bill_-_E-Cigarette_Parity_Amendment_Act_of_2013.pdf  I am totally in support of a ban and any effort to deter smoking. Electronic cigarettes are nothing more than a nicotine delivery system.   	45
 yup...fits with the mildyinteresting   That didn't look too bad. Almost like her foot scooped him squarely in his torso.   Not really a Burns quote, but I liked when they thought Mr. Burns stole a trillion dollar bill and the government was using satellite imagery of Mr. Burns compound to locate the bill. The government guy says, "Using this advanced satellite imagery, we can tell he's not hiding the bill on the roof".    that's funny    I'm glad there are people skeptical to this nonsense and aren't afraid to post it. Yeah to the o.p.   Well I'm glad you admit the validity of my original comment in that Obama didn't actually stand up for the revolutionaries in Iran, although I don't agree with you that he did nothing because he feared for the safety of the dissidents.   	6

 I had problems with this too. It took some time for me to remember that oficially Theon killed Sansa brothers. That's what everybody was told. Only he and maybe some of his guards know that those burned kids were actually some peasant's sons.   I'm not implying it's easy. I know well how hard it is. I've been what people call an introvert all my life, and I still am. I have had problems with anxiety, depression and OCD. I've always been socially inept. But something I have learn is that you have to make an effort to change, you have to push your limits again and again, you have to expose yourself to whatever you fear.  I had social phobia. People still scares me. But this started to change the moment I decided I wanted to change, that I had to face my fears, I had to expose myself to people so it would have less and less power over me.  All I say is this "fucking normies" or "normies suck" or "being normal is wrong" attitude scares me, because is spreading and many people seems to really mean it, beyond memes and irony and REEEEs. I fear that the hikkikomori problem could spread to the western world.   Ok. My english is still not perfect.   It amazes me that nobody ever mentioned to me that goats make human shouts and frogs scream. I didn't know until a couple years ago thanks to the internet.   What?   In a certain way, as a non digital native, it scares me that people joke about being just a normal and socially adjusted person. I want to believe they are just joking, but sometimes, because of the things I read, I'm not so sure.  There is nothing great about being socially anxious or having social phobia. There is nothing great in wasting all your time alone at home playing videogames or surfing the web. If you don't feel comfortable at parties or crowds, ok, I understand it, I can relate to that. Don't force yourself to do something that makes you feel bad. But, for god sake, try to be social, get some friends, talk to people, go to some events in your town, get some laid. Either way, you are gonna have a very sad existence.  I want to believe I'm just taking too seriously a bunch of jokes in an imageboard, but sometimes I don't know. People seem so serious about it.   This is one of the main concepts in Stephen King's "The Dark Tower". The world of the protagonist is inside a leaf of grass that is located in an empty plot (I don't know if this is the right word) in New York. The leaf is rotting, and so is that world.   You are crazy   There would always be hackers that would find the way to hack the voting system and try to change things accordingly to their will. Some of them would be freelance, some of them will be paid by certain parties or lobbies. Some of them would be more sutile and some of them will just unchain numeric chaos.  I've seen polls hacked many times, like in the Eurovision Show or that time Moot was voted most influential man in 2009 Time's poll.   You are super cute. I'd love to see you in a schoolgirl uniform. Just an idea.   Anyway, it's a good compilation.   Please, don't upvote this. It has 666 votes right now. It's perfect this way.   Yeah, maybe I should edit the title and add "In a NEAR future".   I checked, and nah, it's just a [scorpion fly](http://geekologie.com/2012/09/11/scorpion-fly-1.jpg)      There is a proof: I remember perfectly my past lives. I was a peasant in every one of them. That was boring.   They are probably gonna give me weird looks, but I've played worse things in parties, usually just to annoy people.      You are hacking your penis.   Actually it has more to do with my dad's kind of sense of humor. He likes those gags in the movies when somebody kicks a dog or something like that. He loved "A fish called Wanda". They kill a lot of little dogs in that one.   My dad laughed his ass off when we went to the cinema to watch this movie, back in the days.   They could communicate if they have an interpreter. They could have interesting things to talk about, like their problems being disabled or accesing to information.   Where in America? Like, in Colombia?   Ok, I will help you. I'm on my way. I'm in Spain, though. Where are you? I'm gonna have to take a plane, maybe. That will take some hours.   They might end flirting because they like each other and they experienced a funny situation together, and he knows she finds him cute. That has nothing to do with a prank, unless it is proven in the movie, which I didn't watch.   Why?   That youtube channel is bananas!   I think next time I'm the DJ in a party I'm going to play this.   You obviously haven't seen enough rule 34 material.   Learn a poetry from heart, like [The Pirate Song](http://www.grijalvo.com/Citas/b_Espronceda_Cancion_pirata.html) or [El Romance del Prisionero](http://www.poesi.as/indx0001.htm) (this one is shorter).   Great. She is one of my favorite voices in the show.   The interpreter and the deaf guy started laughing because they found the situation ridiculous.   Prank? He's just a deaf guy trying to use a sex hot line through an interpretation service. I admit it's something unusual, but when you are an interpreter you have to face awkward situations all the time, and you compromise to do your job, respecting your user rights and desires.  Thanks for the subtitles. Unfortunately my deaf friends are spanish and they wont understand english. I don't know what I was thinking in the first place, hehe.   I will use this video in the future.   The world never ceases to amaze me.   I'd like to lick it. I bet it sticks to your tongue and tastes sour.   I recommend this album, by the way. I recently discovered Coil and they are certainly interesting and innovative.   Call me crazy, but I think this video is about feet fetish.   All this guy's videos are titled the same   It seems we don't have to be worried about this girl. Apparently her and this guy are good friends. He was kicked out his parents house and she helped him.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScU90xw9LUg   Hey, he's a musician. He can't be a bad guy.   thank mr skeltal   As a former sign language interpreter I must say this girl is making many severe professional mistakes. Things you can be sanctioned for, like lying or removing information. The deaf user could even report her and she would be in trouble. She should translate absolutely everything and don't lie at all. But I guess realism will ruin the fun of the scene.  I wish this was fully subtitled, not only the signs. I could share it with my deaf friends and they would find it hilarious, I'm sure.   Who's that girl?   I will them mine how life was like in the 80's and 90's   I bet the DG guys will love this video.  Also, I laughed at this moment: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9NqFVC0Lwc t=3m23s   Thanks for sharing. I love to read about other people experiences.   Tool used it too in the hidden track "faaip de oidad"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83R54yAB5Cw   What power do you mean?   I thought it was the sound of an egg being fried, layered 309 times.   These are the most perfect tits I'v ever seen. Saved.   I like how in Reddit you usually can make a question and people really give you an answer, instead of getting the "learn to use google" answer that you get in most of the other sites, like 4chan and many, many forums.  You are cool people, redditors.   Not flawless. He forgot to post the dubs-man meme picture.   I was trying to be sarcastic, but it seems that I failed.  It was a way of saying that u/Bluecool was being a jerk, not taking the effort of sharing the video.  I searched "Death grips sxsw", "mc ride attacks camera" and "stefan burnett attacks camera" and found nothing. It's not so easy.   One of the favorite facts I can think of right now is that they decided to leak No Love Deep Web inspired by Magic The Gathering tactics. Zach's brother is a Magic player and told him about control decks, which basically take control over the opponent's cards and turn them against him. So they got into a simbolic stage of power, the Chateau Marmont hotel, frequented by celebrities, and leaked the album from inside. It's all post-modern magic to me. Epic wanted to control them, so they took control.  You can find better explanations of this story here:  http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9004-death-gripz/ http://blogs.artinfo.com/spotlight/2012/11/20/death-grips-are-not-pranksters-just-fans-of-magic-the-gathering/   The trout mask   Yeah, just search "mc Ride attacking camera" and it will get you straight to the exact minute and second of the video where that happens.  Jeez, man.   This is quite hypnotizing too   Right, if people is upvoting this there must be a reason, but I must also listen the opinion of those who frequent this board and were here before than me. Of course, if they don't see it as a proper material, they can just downvote the thing, but I'm interested in everybody's opinion.   Thanks for all the explanations, guys. I posted this just because I thought it was a funny comment, just the kind of stuff I usually see posted on this sub. But I see some people have higher standards than that. I'll have that in mind next time.   OP here. I'd like to know what I did wrong. I thought this fitted well with this subreddit purpose. But since some of you seem upset, I'd like you to explain to me what's wrong with this post.  Thanks.   It seems a lot of people is coming to the same thought, then.   Something similar happens to me with porn. After some hours watching porn, I go to bed and when I close my eyes I see bodies, tits, nude girls everywhere.   Not very original. I've seen this one before in Twitter and 4chan.   Surf the internet, read books, watch films and chat with friends. Sometimes dance helps too.   Sure OP will deliver   That was boring      I just see a hot thing burning other things  	69
 Let's keep this PG.   I think this is unfortunately a solid military strategy on the part of ISIS. People have seen what ISIS does to those who challenge it, so they will have little choice but to fight alongside ISIS. Now the non-extremists may no longer view the war as them against ISIS, but instead the US coalition against the people of Syria.  This is a terrible development. This is like an Arab version of Nazi Germany.   Get some framed posters perhaps?   It depends on the type of flash memory used and the amount of redundant storage in addition to the flash controller. I would presume Intel used high quality flash memory in this device alongside a much more robust controller than those found on USB thumb drives. Additionally Windows 8 has the ability to run with a different memory/service profile on small storage devices to help limit the amount of writes.   There is no way that has an mSATA controller, that alone would almost be wider than the entire device.  Instead it has expandable Micro SD card storage (and right now you can buy MicroSD cards with up to 128GB of space). Also in theory you could plug a thumb drive into the USB port (but it'd be ugly).   There are a lot of major earthquakes in that area historically. Including one of the largest which occurred in 1089AD:  *"William of Malmesbury writes that "all buildings were lifted up, then settled again as before", which does not indicate any damage. It is described as "very great" and "throughout England" by Roger de Hoveden."'*  http://web.archive.org/web/20110516173115/http://www.quakes.bgs.ac.uk/earthquakes/historical/historical_listing.htm   I'd really take this study with a grain of salt as they say. It only included 16 participants and it wasn't a double-blind study (the researchers knew while taking measurements which kids were in the extended swimming classes).  With so few participants it's difficult to say whether the impact of swimming was significant.    It's not uncommon in today's world to preserve a piece of a previous structure/building if it had fallen or been destroyed in tragic circumstances. Perhaps an earthquake caused a collapse that killed many important people?       When non-volatile storage nears both latency and bandwidth of the latest DDR* in production. Bandwidth still has a ways to go, but I could foresee it being doable at a commercial scale in the near future. Latency is an entirely different beast, and will require radical shifts from current consumer SSD tech.  Another factor is wear. RAM is nearly constantly shifted, written, and re-written. RAM doesn't degrade to any significant level with writes, whereas current flash memory used in SSDs does. So drive life is also holding today's SSDs back from threatening RAM.   The problem is that Agile was originally what companies/groups did to keep things moving quickly with minimal restrictions and form. Now in large corporate environments that switched to "agile", the walls are closing in because so many rules/guidelines are being enforced as to how exactly it must function... which goes against every reason the agile approach worked so well.   Not currently believed to be autoimmune related. Something as absolute as saying it's definitely not an autoimmune disease may be a bit too far for a disease with so many unknowns.   If that's the case then it's because you allow it to happen. Naturally there is some give and take with marriage, but if you are just dating, why allow yourself to be railroaded?     I work with a lot of Turks, and they are truly scared of this man and what Erdogan is turning Turkey into. When I first started working with them 5 years ago they were happy for the future of Turkey as a secular state, but now whenever they talk about visits back home they tell me how freedoms are fading away and how people now hesitate to criticize the government in public due to fear of retaliation.   It's a sad series of events, and I too worry that Turkey may be headed towards a path of further backwards "Islamification" of the state. In 20 years we may view the state of Turkey today in the same way we view the state of Iran prior to the Islamic "revolution".     Just 20 more Facebook likes and the war is over!   The fact that "pro-ISIS" rallies have occurred and are allowed in Europe boggles my mind. Waving an ISIS flag should be a crime of supporting terrorism.   It's only a matter of time before Muslim extremists provoke violent responses from masses of people without direct state support. When that moment comes things are going to get really intense.   Regardless I don't think that calls for name calling. You could have just downvoted the post without the insult towards the OP.   Nothing is beyond our reach.   Oil consumption is beginning to slow down across the world, yet more advanced/complex extraction methods are making more oil reserves available for refining/production. Most oil producing countries are still using older extraction methods, so if they shift to methods like fracking they can get even bigger 'slices of the pie'.  The US is also now the largest oil producer as well as one of the largest consumers. The US is extremely stable, so there is less likelihood of major shortages due to political/military events. This smooths the volatility of the developed world's oil supply.   For a long term investment I'd suggest putting funds into BP or Chevron stocks. They normally rise and fall with consumer demand and prices, and in the long term such low oil prices cannot last forever... There is bound to be a disturbance, or eventual supply shortage that causes prices to rise.  Additionally these companies are also working on alternative energy investments, so if the price of oil stays low for a long time they will likely boost their R D and alternative energy production and the stocks may increase inversely with oil prices down the road.  I'm waiting until oil gets towards $30, then I'm going to dump a lot of money into these stocks.   I wonder how economical such factories would be... I think they'd pretty much require initial state funding to even become slightly competitive when run by private parties.   This is cool stuff regardless though, and I could see this LED based 'factory' tech eventually making its way to isolated villages or remote research stations such as those on Antarctica. But another major hurdle to overcome is that many of the places with food shortages also have power shortages.   I was preparing to be really really impressed.               Does form count for extra points?   Oh for sure. It wasn't meant to be a blanket statement.  But that link you provided is about how Russia refused to share space technology with China's space program? That seems to provide further evidence of how many states are well aware and afraid of China's strong tendency to steal engineering plans for their own production. China is smart, and it's a great way for them to advance. But it certainly makes potential state partners very wary of working with the Chinese on anything cutting edge..   That's a bit different though right? In the case of Russian spacecraft the US government was paying the Russian's for launch services, or the engines were being purchased directly from Russia. China in many cases will simply copy foreign tech after obtaining details specifications and engineering details via espionage, which is much less civil in my opinion.   Being cold in general also lowers the body's immune response does it not?    As someone who has autism and has read countless research papers on the subject, screw that anti-vaccine group. I wish we could somehow temporarily teleport them to the 1940s or 1950s. I imagine if they had their siblings, friends, and other relatives dying around them due to polio they'd change their tune pretty quick.   Breakthroughs in reconnaissance satellites could definitely make their way into civilian life.  It's a lot of money for the key hole program, but I think aerial/satellite surveillance programs are good investments for preventing more costly conflicts.      Not at all. But comparing a country's recent actions to another country's actions that took place long ago isn't a fair comparison when it fails to take into account the significantly different geopolitical atmosphere.     Not in the lifetime of anyone still alive today.    That would burn.   Thanks! This was very to the point and now I'm definitely leaning towards 20% down over paying in cash.  Interestingly a few people have PMed me too with some other things swaying my decision. Mainly that if I use most of my funds in buying a house, I lose a lot of liquidity and may have to sell the house and pay rent again anyway if something unexpected sidelines me from earning an income through the workforce for a couple of years. Whereas if I have a mortgage, I still am sitting on considerable investments that could be partially cashed to weather unforeseen emergencies.  Thank you again! And to the others who offered advice =)   Over the last few years my returns on investments have averaged out to around 20%, but the market is still rebounding from the 2008 recession so I don't expect I'll see such high returns in the coming years. Historically it seems the stock market has been averaging a 6-7% yearly return, so that is what I'm anticipating for the future.  My expected interest for the mortgage is currently around 5% (I have 1 percentage point added on due to having no credit history).  The purpose for buying the house is simply as a place to live and unwind. A place I can call my own, instead of being at the mercy of a landlord. I am not buying the house itself for investment purposes.   I really like the idea of not having any monthly housing costs outside of taxes/insurance/maintenance by buying a house in full. Right now I'm paying $2,300 per month in rent, so having that extra $25,000+ in my bank account each year by buying in full would be significant. However after looking at 'interest tables' for my current investments and average historical market returns I see that over time the compounding interest on those investments can lead to values **significantly** greater than the cost of a mortgage on a $500k house over 30 years.  I'm 28 yrs old and I've never been in debt. Previously I thought buying everything in full was the best approach. Now I'm not so sure. An advice would be very much appreciated.   So basically it's like going back to the old west, minus all the violence and disease =O   Interestingly because guns are so prevalent so is the value of learning gun safety in communities. Gun violence in Idaho is relatively rare considering how many people own guns.   A great way to get IP information for usernames (being people will likely check their username first). Granted I'm sure it's less sinister, but the potential for some intelligence collection is definitely there. =)   Idaho is one of the most armed states in the US. It has the county with the highest gun ownership. Almost everyone has a gun.   Lots of flavors too! Kiwi is very popular and delicious. Lemon or Grapefruit are usually despised. For a while there was even a 'sparkling energy drink', but it seems to have gotten pulled.    Second, it is expensive and there is no reason for farmers to adopt these farming techniques as they are more expensive.  Perhaps in less developed countries, but in developed countries like the US, no-till drills like air seeders are becoming very desirable and cost effective. Mostly due to reduced fuel and labor/time costs by removing the need for plowing.      [Apocalypse Now - Ride of the Valkyries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKaYOW9zMoY)  Also... pretty much anything in Watchmen.   It was a dinner just like all the others, except this time it was filled with an aurora of hatred only known to one of the participants. Wally stared across the table at Clint, hoping for some flickering indication of regret of humanity. Wally and Clint had been meeting at this diner for the last 10 years. Best friends since grade school they enjoyed each others company even in silence But that was before Before Wally found out Clint was sleeping with Wallys wife, Bonnie. That was before.  Wally had spent the previous night restless, pacing back and forth contemplating his next move. Occasionally he would glance up at the shotgun hanging on the wall. A shotgun handed down to him through several generations of his family. There it hung, so peaceful, so tranquil. He grabbed it off the wall and went out on the porch. He made up his mind, his beautiful wife was everything, and Clint had taken her from him, so he was going to take Clints breath with the shotgun that lay on his lap.  But then as Wally sat there, the sun began to rise, casting shades of orange hues across the crisp morning sky. This is beautiful. Clint said to himself. Thinking perhaps there was more beauty in the world to behold Wally walked back into his living room, and hung the shotgun back above the mantle.   Back at the dinner, Wally wondered if he had made the right decision in sparing Clints life, in carrying on as though nothing had ever happened. He only wished there was some indication of regret on the part of Clint for his betrayal, yet he saw none. So deep within his own thoughts, Wally barely noticed at first the fly that landed upon the table beside his soup. But then it became his focus. This creature, so small, yet so intricate without any worries in the world...   Look out Clint exclaimed as he eyed the fly and reached for a newspaper resting on the table. No, Wally calmly said as Clint raised the newspaper above the fly. Dont do it. Why, its only a fly? Clint asked. No replied Wally. Its beautiful.  The newspaper smacked down hard against the table. Other diners turned to see what the commotion was about. Then they saw the dead fly and returned to their own lives.  Wally finished his dinner with Clint, without another word spoken. As usual he paid his portion of the bill, and then Wally sauntered out of the diner and drove back to his house. He sat a moment in his idling car, and watched the wind blow across the tall autumn grass. He turned the ignition off, opened his door, and walked into his living room, and lifted the shotgun off the wall...   --------------------------------  **Note:** Be gentle as this is my first WP. Integrating **first degree** (premeditated versus 'in the moment') murder into a story was an interesting constraint.    Jesus Christ, this country almost looks like it is on its way to an all out race war. The tension keeps rising and eventually we'll probably start seeing revenge killings on both sides. So sad.   This has gotta be a remake/model of an original artifact. The base looks modern and there is no way such an ancient artifact would be stood up like that in such an uncontrolled environment.   It's difficult to comprehend just how fast and insanely awesome this aircraft is. At its top speed it is traveling over 3x the speed of a bullet leaving the barrel of a typical hunting rifle, or about the same speed as a bullet leaving the barrel of an M16. That's fast.    It seems to me like it's actually on the decline. I'm in the engineering sector and it's actually "cool" to work in a smart/nerdy field again, and young people are striving for knowledge and education like never before.   Just look how many people stood up against SOPA and other similar attempts to cull/regulate free information and media. To me that's an intellectual fight, and young people are fully behind it.  I can totally see anti-intellectualism taking hold in older generations, but thanks to the internet and the awareness it provides to young people. I think the future for intellectuals in the US is brighter than ever.   I'm really hoping for a Netflix streaming release. It could forever alter how movies are released in the future.    Neat.   It's trying to entice you over to touch the forbidden fruit.   Who has magically disappeared?   The only questionable death I'm aware of in recent years is that reporter who died in a car crash after working on leak stories. Even that is very inconclusive.     When say a rapist is caught, tried, and thrown in prison, that's prevention against future crime. By your logic we should just release all violent prisoners because the cops made things worse by reigning them in. Genius.  Looking at your history I see you're mental and probably want to kill cops too. Get a life.   Well I hate to break it to you, but if thugs break into your house you won't be able to defend yourself with a keyboard.   Yes because cops obviously don't help society or people in need... You're an absolute idiot.   That's like telling people not to use Facebook and it's easy because they just have to get all there friends to switch too.            "Commander sir? There is magic outside of my window again."   It's pretty easy, and it happens and is even broadcast across media on a higher level. All of that support going to the FSA and opposition groups in Syria is partly because they are ruthlessly attacking the bigger enemies like ISIS. Somewhere in Syria there is probably an intelligence agent overseeing "rebels" torturing and killing ISIS members. The thing is... I don't feel too bad for them. People probably felt the same way during the Vietnam war.    Or is it half-side up?         Usually no more than a foot in my region. Below that you can sometimes see goldfish swimming around (people dumped goldfish in some of the mountain ponds and amazingly they survived).      The ice freezes like this in the mountain ponds where I'm from when the wind is extremely calm or non-existent, and the temperature is relatively consistent between day and night (say 21F in the day and 15F at night).    Cool. Thanks Bud.   I can definitely vouch for the black area in central Washington state. There is a town there called Othello that is basically like Mexico. I stopped there this year while travelling and went to a Burger King, and none of the people inside working knew English and everyone was speaking Spanish. I tried to order something in English and got a confused look, and then told them the number I was trying to order and they still didn't understand. That's when a lady nearby stepped in and told them in Spanish, and then they figured it out... It amazes me that a franchise like Burger King doesn't require customer facing workers know English.  After that little bizarre event I drove around town out of curiosity and a lot of the signs were in Spanish as well, and I didn't see a single non-hispanic white outside of the gas station. It was like I was in the twilight zone.   Can't we just photoshop it closer and save NASA billions?      Sounds like neuromytonia and stress, which go hand in hand. You should stop googling ALS symptoms and start a health tracking journal. Also I would suggest asking your MD to test for ganglionic achr antibodies. If you have them you can take the immune therapy route and may be cured by spontaneous remission.   I thought this was /r/science, not /r/politics   "Because I'm tired of looking at them down here."   Sponsored by Autism perhaps?   You don't have to be in an organization to help guide it and interact with it. If I provided as little as $200k for equipment and operational costs, did you think they were going to ignore me?  It works the same way for the government. If someone were to give a senator a multi-million dollar donation, that senator then has a responsibility to look out for his/her donation supplier. If she or he does not, then they should not accept the donations in the first place.   There are crazies in most forums. I'm not in the organization but I've funneled some funds that way, and the contacts I have had made some great guarantees when it comes to keeping the active members sane.    I can almost "hear" the silence.    As depressing as the reports may be, I still have pretty high confidence that a solution will be found when things start getting really chaotic. If all the governments of the UN came together and set up an insanely massive reward for the first organization/government/corporation that can create a scalable CO2 scrubber, I think we'd stand a much better chance.  There aren't that many resources working on CO2 scrubbing technologies, because there is currently not enough economic incentive.    Oh yes I was absolutely making a generalization, but one I still believe to be accurate. As a generalization it certainly doesn't apply to all cases, such as yours and even mine to some degree.   The sample size is incredibly small for this study (20 people) so I'd take it with a grain of salt. The other thing I wonder about is whether the researchers provided a work space to the participants (ie: a job specific to the study), or whether the participants were monitored in their real-world work environment. If it's the latter, the study might be polluted by the work hierarchy. In my office building for example, I can tell you the successful people are more likely to have window offices and be less stressed because they generally aren't doing the frustrating "low level work". The lower level workers are more likely to have window-less offices and be more stressed... so I have a feeling if you moved those workers into similar workspaces, you'd still have distinct groups when it came to cortisol/stress levels, regardless of whether they had windows.  **Edit:** I'm not questioning the well known relation between sunlight and mood... Only the methods used in this study and their concluded level of impact.   It's not accessible via the internet in the browser sense, but for my private projects where I don't want to use VSO/GIT and still want to access them remotely, I just do so via Remote Desktop. It could be a similar option for you if you are using Windows clients.  	87

 That's fine, but improper phrasing leads to ambiguous sentence meaning and can confuse people.   And yet, here we are, with apparently nobody having a problem understanding what was typed.  And **THAT** is what matters.  Using "while" makes it sound as though the two acts were occurring simultaneously but were unrelated to one another,   Again, don't care.  Nobody but you seems to have trouble understanding what it says/means.  which is the exact opposite of what you mean to say.  *meant  Since I wrote this hours ago, I would use "meant" because it was in the past.

His corps was probing skirmish lines ahead of the left flank of Confederate defenses and he was directing artillery placements. Confederate sharpshooters were about 1,000 yards (900 m) away and their shots caused members of his staff and artillerymen to duck for cover. Sedgwick strode around in the open and was quoted as saying, "What? Men dodging this way for single bullets? What will you do when they open fire along the whole line?" Although ashamed, his men continued to flinch and he said, "Why are you dodging like this? They couldn't hit an elephant at this distance." Reports that he never finished the sentence are apocryphal, although the line was among his last words.[5] He was shot moments later under the left eye and fell down dead.  Sedgwick was the highest ranking Union casualty in the Civil War. Although James B. McPherson was in command of an army at the time of his death and Sedgwick of a corps, Sedgwick had the most senior rank by date of all major generals killed. Upon hearing of his death, Lt. Gen.

The spotted hyenas have a highly erectile clitoris, complete with a false scrotum, and "the resemblance to male genitalia is so close that sex can be determined with confidence only by palpation of the scrotum". The pseudo-penis can also be distinguished from the males' genitalia by its greater thickness and more rounded glans. The female possesses no external vagina, as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum. In the females, this scrotum consists of soft adipose tissue. Like male spotted hyenas with regard to their penises, the female spotted hyenas have small penile spines "on the glans, or head, of [their clitorises], making the clitoris tip feel like soft sandpaper". The clitoris "extends away from the body in a sleek and slender arc, measuring, on average, over 17 cm from root to tip.

The arrival of the ancestral bone-crushing hyenas coincided with the decline of the similarly built but unrelated Percrocutidae family. The bone-crushing hyenas survived the devastating changes in climate and the arrival of canids, which wiped out the dog-like hyenas, though they never crossed into North America, as their niche there had already been taken by the Borophaginae family. By 5 million years ago, the bone-crushing hyenas became the dominant scavengers of Eurasia, primarily feeding on large herbivore carcasses felled by sabre-toothed cats. One genus, Pachycrocuta, was a 200 kg (440 lb) mega-scavenger that could splinter the bones of elephants.

He moved to his grandparents' farm in Jackson, Michigan, when he was five, but the transition was traumatic and he developed a stutter so severe he refused to speak. When he moved to Brethren, Michigan, in later years, a teacher at the Brethren schools helped him overcome his stutter. He remained functionally mute for eight years, until he entered high school. He credits his English teacher, Donald Crouch, who discovered he had a gift for writing poetry, with helping him end his silence. Crouch believed forced public speaking would help Jones gain confidence and insisted he recite a poem in class every day. "I was a stutterer. I couldn't talk. So my first year of school was my first mute year, and then those mute years continued until I got to high school."      Guessing that father was Darth Vader.  Not surprised at all.

During the trial, deputy prosecuting attorney Anthony Cillo described Petric as a cold, calculating killer who plotted to murder his parents, Mark and Susan Petric, and make it appear to be a murder-suicide by putting the gun in his father's hand.  Defense Attorney James Kersey has said that Petric was obsessed with the "Halo" series of video games, which he played 18 hours a day when he had the chance. Petric used his father's key to open a lockbox and remove a 9 mm handgun and the game.  Mark Petric, who is a minister at New Life Assembly of God in Wellington, testified that his son came into the room and asked: "Would you guys close your eyes? I have a surprise for you."  The father testified that he expected a pleasant surprise. Then his head went numb from a gunshot and he survived. His wife, Susan, 43, died of gunshot wound to the head.  Kersey said during the trial that when the teenager fled the grisly scene, he only took one item with him: the "Halo 3" game.      Relevant text:  Fahad is an avid Nintendo fan.

We have been refilling the ink cartridges as they run out using a refill kit. The last fill up was about 2 weeks ago. Since then we have printed about 30 pages, all black. But still, attempting to clean the printheads, it appears as if there is no ink left in ANY of the cartridges when you try to print (it's blotchy, same behavior as if they were empty).  I have read that the cartridges eventually die out after about 5 ink refills. Is this the sort of behavior that is normally exhibited?   You have a ferret!?   Sikhs are hardcore!

Oh, and when someone calls them out on their bullshit, they threaten to stop policing - just like the NYPD.

I don't think ive spent more than 50 dollars and that was on an 10 inch bone cleaver.   I'm a telecommunications engineer, with a specialization in voice data. I also support net neutrality. BUT this article is really, factually, incorrect.  First:  As far as the network is concerned, data is just data - a series of 0s and 1s. A telecom network sees all data as a series of 0s and 1s - whether it is video, text or graphics. That is, in fact, the key advantage of the Internet - it doesn't care what the data is ultimately going to be assembled into - a picture, a text message or voice.  This is *mostly* correct. Data is just data, but all data is subject to varying levels of service. The network DOES care what type of data it is, because several types of data have very different requirements. If a packet (the bits of information that encapsulate all data on the internet when they're in transit) for a lolcat picture shows up 3 seconds late, you probably won't notice - your workstation receives it 3 seconds late, it will figure out what resource it is part of, add the data, and you see your picture. Likewise, if packets are received with varying levels of delay, or are received out of order, you probably won't notice. Everything can be done on a "best effort" basis.  If voice packets to your 911 phone call show up 3 seconds late, your call is going to be completely unintelligible and someone could die as a consequence. Likewise, if your voice packets show up incredibly out of order, or if the amount of delay is all over the place, the call will be unintelligible. The same is true for video. So, while all data is data, not all data is treated equally (hence terms like QoS and DSCP) because it makes no sense to treat all data 100% equally. Just like you wouldn't store people in a cargo compartment of an airplane - different payloads have different requirements. For voice signaling and media to be considered acceptable you essentially need to dedicate a 64Kbps channel to media (more or less, this varies by voice codec, 64kbps is G.711 u-law, the standard). This is data that requires timely delivery, and has specific requirements to ensure that those packets get routed across the network faster than your lolcat pictures so your phone call is actually understandable when you call 911. Video falls in the same bucket to be usable (the big difference is that video on most cable networks is distributed using multicast traffic whereas voice needs to be unicast).  Second:  As a result, the cost of carrying 1 GB of text data and 1 GB of video data on the Internet is exactly the same. In that sense, neutrality is built into the very structure and essence of the Internet. So, once it's agreed that 1 GB of video does not stress telecom networks more than 1 GB of text messages, there is absolutely no justification for telcos to discriminate on the basis of what these 0s and 1s will ultimately be put together into.  This one is more problematic. The cost of carrying 1GB of text data is significantly lower than 1GB of video/voice precisely because of what I mentioned above. 1GB of text data likely has no QoS (Quality of Service) requirement attached to it. It doesn't matter if the packets show up in a jumble, the user's software can reassemble them and show them their cat picture and cat story within a few milliseconds. However voice and video require "timely" transmission and receipt. If your voice or video packets show up out of order, are slowed down, or have delays that bounce all over the place (jitter), you have the option of either adding a buffer (which has a noticable impact on user experience) or removing buffers and ensuring that all network equipment along the communication path knows to give that traffic priority. Either way, you have added expense in either user experience, additional equipment, or infrastructure to dedicate bandwidth to that one particular stream of data - something you don't have to do for text data. In addition there are significantly different types of equipment required for specific types of traffic. For example voice data will require SBCs (session border controllers), SIP proxies, application servers, etc to be traversed - again, different hardware is required to process a different type of data. So while it's all 1's and 0's, the way the 1's and 0's are treated is fundamentally different. So, yes, 1GB of voice stresses entirely different equipment than 1GB of text.  Another strike against the article is it, like so many others, treats the internet like a "cloud" when in fact that "cloud" is made up of thousands of different networks that each can impose a toll to send your packets across their borders, and they do. It's the whole basis of the wholesale data/voice industry. Every time a packet traverses network borders, there is an opportunity for a charge to be applied. If it is voice data where there are SLA's (service level agreements) that have to be maintained, there may be even bigger charges. In fact, usually routing tables are often built not on the basis of speed, but on the basis of cost (that's why lots of routers give you the option to choose between them). Not mentioning this shows that the author has a very lay understanding of how the technology works.  Like I said, i am pro net-neutrality (and amazingly enough, most engineers behind telecoms are). But I really wish more of these articles were written by people who were actually in the industry and not folks who don't really understand how converged networks work, or how the modern internet functions. A lot of the pushback on net neutrality makes more sense when you see things from the side of an engineer who maintains them. I still don't like it, but saying "all data is the same!" ignores that all data is different, and therefore the requirements are different.    Yup, that sounds similar to mine. I get tiny bubbles, about the 1mm or so (very rarely larger), usually on my fingers. They rarely are red unless I scratch them open.  I wish I could just be a carrier.

Or how about that time I posted that it was concerning how quick the mods were to ban or shadow ban anyone who asked difficult questions, and how it was giving the forum a bad image as an echo chamber? You swooped in to tell me off because "I didn't know what I was talking about," along with other juvenile insulting tirades. Man, I guess I was right again.  I wonder, when Garza made you a mod on HT, how many people did you censor? How many people who were telling the truth did you ban? How many more did you berate for asking good, valid, uncomfortable questions? How many lives do you think you helped destroy because you helped usher Garza's charade along? Do you sleep well at night knowing how much you supported his scams and some people could literally be homeless because of you? Does that bother you at all?  Whatever happened to those documents and emails you were going to leak with the other XPY origin people? The ones you raised a big stink about on gethashing and then suddenly disappeared?   How the hell does this not count as a public ommission of guilt that he is trying to skirt regulatory obligation?   We have.

Hey everyone, I am hoping someone may be able to find this video.  The video was of an African American gentleman who served in the US army during Jim Crowe segregation, before the civil rights act provided protections in public Accommodations.  He discusses how when he went to a new base, one of his first orders of business was trying to find an apartment. The base had several landlords they worked with, and all were keen on his business. Until he showed up. Then suddenly none had any rooms available. He ended up having to find a place well over an hour off base to live.  He continues on about when he had to transfer bases, how hotels would have vacancy signs on, but when he would ask for a room they'd say they forgot to turn the sign off until he left, and then in the rearview he'd see the sign flip back on.  Specifically I need this for an ongoing discussion about human rights and the reason behind protecting classes of people in public accommodations.  Any help identifying the video would be very much appreciated.   Hm, I will definitely investigate. I think I need to do a mental paradigm shift from how Splunk works.   Hey everyone. First, I am coming from a Splunk background. That's a big driver for why I am curious about hadoop. We are involved with generating massive amount of logs, but the cost to take enough data into splunk and make it useful is absolutely devastating. So, i am interested in looking at hadoop as a possible alternative.  I know that instead of using indexes, hadoop uses HDFS. Can anyone provide some information on how you get data into HDFS?  With splunk, I can configure a forwarder to tail files, listen on ports, etc, and all data is then forwarded into Splunk indexers. Those indexes then process the data based on rules we create, add some metadata, and store them in time series indexes. You can then search against the data.  So, does hadoop have something like forwarders? Would I need to copy logs onto HDFS somehow? I'm just trying to figure out how it works.   holy shit... what kind of wood is that?

They dont actually test for the drug - they test for metabolites of the drug (the leftover chemicals after the drug has been metabolized). You could smoke pot, be high, and take a test a few minutes later and show as clean. It would take several hours for metabolites to show up in a meaningful way.  This is important because chemical analogs could pitentially produce the same metabolites,  meaning you vould fail a screening necause you ingested something chemically similar.   Ozymandias from Watchmen. Because seriously, he was right. (Trying to keep this spoiler free)   Wave really was useful under the right conditions. I remember having 10 people similtaneously editing a single document - a plan for a large camping trip. Everyone was able to edit everything and add stuff on to lists,  claim responsibility for stuff (I'll bring the cheetos!), delegate tasks (hot Becki will call the campground), etc. We had the whole trip planned in about 45 minutes. It never could have been done that fast trying to coordinate with other tools available at the time.  The problem is most folks didn't get to have that experience, so I think it kinda floundered. The nice thing is, they spooned the code into google drive.  If you have multiple editors on a single document, you can use it just like you used wave. So the spirit lives on.   I made money selling invites on ebay. Much beer and pot was had.   But the thing is, personal computing wasn't their primary sector, and it still isn't. They did dabble, but ultimately refocused because it wasnt in line with their core business. Their name says it all: International Business Machines.  Microsoft doesn't really produce hardware, while IBM does. A better company to compare IBM to would be Cray. Except IBM does way more in the way of r d and integration services. They're a veritable patent factory.   Yeah, I get what you are saying but its also important to remember that IBM is massive, and has many lines of business.  Losing out to MS on personal computing is like saying GE lost to Sylvania. Sure, maybe in one market, light bulbs, but overall that was one product line of thousands.   Honestly it would be awesome if your dad could do an AMA. I would love to know more about watson under the skirt. What powers it...him...? Is it some crazy heavy metal mainframes like ibm produces? Is it hundreds of mainframes? Just a ton of commodity pizza box hardware? How much memory does Watson have? How is data stored? What sort of algo does it use for storing and retrieving, and for semantic processing? Is it map reduce with some special sauce? Stuff like that.  I'm a telecom r d engineer - IBM would be a dream job for me if only for the truly cool things they build.   IBM hasn't really competed with microsoft since OS/2. They are in largely different sectors.   As someone who grew up about 2 miles from a stone quarry, fuck yes.   I'd argue that it is tied with hashing as the greatest sport you've never heard of.  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_House_Harriers   As a US American, the first time I saw a hurling match I fell in love. Then I lost the world sports channel so I haven't seen it since. I'd love to play though.   AIN'T NOTHIN GONNA BREAK HIS STRIDE   GAWsome!   LOL! I actually didn't! However, my wife has her masters in music education :) She's my go-to when I don't have access to my primary teacher, up to and including how to study the best.   Still, it will let me make some killer [gummy bears](http://mixthatdrink.com/vodka-gummy-bears/).   God damnit, I wish Pennsylvania let alcohol be sold privately :(   Vocal trance is awesome. How that dubstep crap ever overtook it I'll never understand. We had dubstep back in my day - it was called hard house.   Also, something bout Murika, roads, trucks, tractors, and tight jeans   Usually I approach a new piece like this:  First, play through ignoring pretty much anything related to dynamics, just trying to see where my hand/fingers need to be, sticking roughly to note durations. I don't use a metronome for this.  Second, I start approaching the piece from the beginning with a metronome, usually around 30bpm, and start slowly working through it until I can mostly play it.   Next, I play through and focus on every spot I seem to have an issue with transitions, places where I can't get my hand to the right spot, etc. I mark off passages I have a hard time with (usually the book looks like graphite exploded all over it at this point).  I drill on those sections one at a time, trying to tighten them up or seeing if there is a different way to play them, and then incorporate them back into the piece. Usually I'll either start by playing the same line over and over until I can play through smoothly.  The problem is, there are still some rough edges at this point when the piece is played altogether.  At this point, my teacher usually requests me to start focusing on musicality.  That's the process... also I try to jump back and forth between 2-3 pieces at any given time so I don't get bored when I'm practicing and start to lose focus. Usually I max out at 2-3 playthroughs of a particular piece (about 5-10 minutes) before I switch to another of the pieces.   In the Parkening book, I'm currently working on Greensleeves and some of the more technical exercises. While I can play the piece, I find that, like I said, I am having a lot of buzzing/muted strings when I shouldn't.  Another example is Allegro from Giuliani - I can play clearly except for the the notes where the 3rd and 4th finger are used on the fret hand - I can focus on placing them perfectly, but it slows me down considerably. Otherwise I can get them "more or less" right but tonality suffers. This piece I have mostly mastered though, it's not as bad as greensleeves.   I've been using Pumping Nylon mostly for the finger exercises (ascending slurs, descending slurs, finger strength and independence builders, etc).   Yup - I do. I just have clumsy fingers which don't do me any favors. I usually start abysmally slow (sub 30bpm) and progress from there. I still have issues getting everything clear. But much below that and I can't really keep track of the beat easily.   I adore my Kremona. They cost less than spanish classical guitars, but have a sound easily comparable to a higher end Spanish classical.   Hey everyone. I have been playing sincr june of last year, so maybe I am getting ahead of myself. However I still notice a lot of buzzes, or inadvertently muted strings.  I've talked with my teacher and he said that right now it's more important to explore a variety of different exercises than it is to get things perfect.  Still, the buzzes/twangs/muted notes annoy me because I know they don't sound right, which usually leads me to pause my playing and correct my fingering. This has caused a nasty habit of stopping what I'm doing instead of carrying on the melody. We are working to eliminate that now - with the rational reason being that the ear is more forgiving to a missed note or slight buzz than it is the piece suddenly stopping and starting.  But if I'm not to focus on getting fingerings perfect now, how can I work to ensure that I'm not building muscle memory with the incorrect fingerings? How can I still keep focusing on progressing while still also keeping a mind to improving my fingering?  I'm working through the parkening method, and also the Pumping Nylon technique book.   Or Filipino.  Or really anywhere from the Pacific islands   Can you provide a verifiable source that he actually manipulated data? The only claim I've heard was a meta-analysis of his work that most news sites orgs misinterpreted as showing Milgram doctored results when that's not really what the study showed at all.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3976349/   I would become a pig - preferably a heritage pig. I have eaten so many of them, its only fair to go through what they do.  On top of that, I could br used to make some of the finest food on earth.   I think you're missing my main point.  In OP's case, he didn't see an issue for months, came back to damage, but the damage had been ongoing for months.  In my case, the issue was hidden (floor tile covered the damage) and damage built over a few months, until we saw damage after chipping a tile).  In both cases, damage built up over time and wasn't noticed by the owner.  I get what you're saying that insurance companies aren't the catechall for "deferred maintenance" (which is somewhat incorrect because you can be actively maintaining a property and not notice damage if it is occurring to, say, subfloor - you are suggesting that the owner isn't maintaining things when they may be). The point is - OP's insurance company may not help him if the damage has built over time.    Pain neuron is a guy. Pressure neuron is a girl. Spinal cord is bar. Inhibitory neuron is bouncer.   I feel like this should be made into a t-shirt.   Am successful friend. I post mostly scathing indictments of coworkers where I know they can never read them.  Oh, and pictures of cats.   You may also end up paying more for your repair if you do that. Many old/broken parts are sold back to companies like NAPA, advance auto, autozone, national auto, etc for what's called a "core credit." Essentially the parts can be cleaned, milled, and often refurbished to be used again, or melted down and made into something new.  If you ask for the part, the mechanic won't get the core credit on the price they pay for the part, so they'll pay a higher price. That higher price will be passed on to you. In many cases, unless you are the one purchasing a new part, you can't redeem the core for the old part (this helps prevent chop shops from selling stolen parts). So while you may feel more secure the job was done, you will pay a good bit more cash for it.

Being part of the golden sperm club doesn't make you naturally talented.  And most intellectuals are able to look at the world around them and see that the best, most stable countries are the ones that have tried to stray from either extreme with a mix of some socialism and capitalism (primarily capitalistic societies with socialist programs to support the poor, provide education, and help the downtrodden). There's a reason so many conservatives lambaste universities as "citadels of liberalism" - because most intellectuals disagree with a lot of what you're saying.  You sound like you've read a bit too much Ayn Rand.   When you have lost that much, so brutally, what in the world can really get you down?  Asshole cut you off in traffic? Well, at least he wasn't threading a rope through my hands or bashing my child against a tree.  My income tax bill was higher than expected? Well, it's not like watching my wife be clubbed to death.  The things most people consider to be problems in our neck of the world simply don't compare to the true monsters that are out there. When you've seen those monsters, I think most of the modern world's troubles just... well... they aren't really troubles.    Why did an ideology devoted to the very best in us turn out to be so good in unleashing the very worst?  The same reason that religions are so good at slaughtering people. The most dangerous people are the people who are convinced that they are working for good.   It's also appropriate to be vigilant about people who seem eager to kill or to excuse collateral damage.   Dinner.   This is something I always think about - we refer to ourselves as exceptionally violent, but if you watch most animals in their social structures, they are plenty violent. 2 million ants and termites fighting and killing every survivor of the other side for example. Domestic cats kill trillions a year.  We do have the market cornered on doing it in an organized, systematic fashion, though.   Not really. Give those people an authority figure and a sense that they'll be punished if they don't listen, and people are often more than happy to kill. Look up the Milgram experiments. Human beings are brutal creatures.   Yup, I meant units and not options.  Now I'm wondering if this is a yearly thing, or a one time grant. I suppose that's a question for my boss.   Ok, that makes sense!  I think I'm starting to understand a bit more now. From what I am gathering about the restricted grant, that is essentially stock shares I am given but according to a vesting schedule.  I think I'm understanding now. Thank you!!   So, it is less income, and more a guaranteed discount on the price of the stock shares? In fact, I'd have to have the money on hand to purchase the shares if I wanted to use the options?   At my yearly review, my supervisor was surprised to see that I was the only one on my team not receiving stock options. He said he would see what he could do about that.  Today I logged in to fidelity and see two new account types that have been added - restricted stock options, and a "stock option plan".  The restricted stock options look like they are full shares that just have a vesting schedule over the next 5 years.  The stock options though, those I don't understand. The account shows a zero balance. BUT it shows a "NSO" type grant, with a grant price a few dollars above the current stock price. It says there are N unvested options, and N total options (N is the same number). It also shows an expiration date 10 years from now.  Can anyone help explain what this means? I've never had stock options before and I'm kind of confused, specifically about the second item. Also, how are these guys taxed? I'm pretty good with finances and investing but this one is new to me.   Will this help him? I know most insurance will only help with acute problems (we had a pipe burst), and not build-up problems (slow leak led to damage over the course of a few months). I say this because we recently had to gut a bathroom after finding out there was a small leak doing damage over time that had all but rotted out a floor. The insurance company wouldn't help.   I was surprised that the install on the macbook was pretty painless. Basically it fired up an open source driver, and then gave me the option to install the restricted ATI driver, and boom. Worked without any fuss. I'm glad to hear that things continue to improve. Has any movement been made on supporting more wireless chipsets?  As of last year I know it was still a bear for a lot of broadcom chipsets, and even when you could get them to work the signal reception was terrible compared to the same device in windows.  I don't mind linux on a desktop, but, I still just feel like I'm more comfortable with it using a command line. Maybe I'm nostalgic for the old red hat apollo days (been using linux for almost 20 years now, sheesh).  I tend to be a pragmatist about OS's :)   Honestly, it was probably in 2008-2010. What thrashed it was doing a system update on ubuntu (I had been running compiz fusion). It royally jacked up the system and I just couldn't get it back. But it left such a bad taste in my mouth after fighting to get that ATI card running.  Eventually I made the switch over to mac hardware, probably in... 2012 maybe? I tri-boot OSX, windows, and ubuntu. And I will say that the graphics management in ubuntu has **markedly** improved, but hardware compatibility is still a bit of a pain sometimes (especially on mac hardware). Fan control is a bit of an issue (it's either off or full blast), and backlighting can all be temperamental. I find i can work just as efficiently in OSX with some tweaks as I can in linux. Especially with brew.  I boot into my ubuntu partition maybe once every few months.. I really should just nuke it and reclaim the space.  I have about 2000 RHEL boxes at work so I get plenty of linux exposure there, lol.   Just remember how much libraries have helped you the next time your local legislators try to cut their funding.  Libraries are the hallmark of a civilized culture. Taking them away from people is spitting in the face of human progress.   Awesome! Glad I could help! I was a vegetarian for about 8 years, but got lured back in by bacon, fish and hot dogs :) The upside is I have no issue with tofu.  One thing I would recommend - after you sear the pineapple, sprinkle with a big pinch of kosher salt and cover with some aluminum foil (do NOT do this if you have it on a metal pan or plate). The salt really makes the pineapple pop.   Hey everyone. Today I made peanut butter eggs for the upcoming holiday. We had a decent amount of leftover chocolate and I happened to have a lego brick mold, so I figured what the heck. This photoset shows the rest: http://imgur.com/a/ZNUFk  My question though, is about this photo: http://i.imgur.com/r3Y0pCG.jpg  What are those marks from? The chocolate was tempered with shortening, and it seems like even though it was completely incorporated with the chocolate, it managed to resolidify in some spots. Additionally, along the side of the mold I have several streaks, as if the chocolate was extremely old.  What caused this? How can I avoid it in the future? This is the first time I've used a mold to make chocolate so I'm unsure what I did incorrectly. The mold was buttered, and then had the hot chocolate poured in.   There are a ton of really good thickeners, and the key is knowing when to use each one. I prefer arrowroot to cornstarch as far as starch-based thickeners.  Gelatin is also very good. Rouxs have already been covered above.  The final one is a personal favorite - reductions. While not as great at thickening, they are FANTASTIC at intensifying flavors in a way that no other thickener can.   It works very well, just make sure to use a very mild cheese (hence farmer cheese). Anything strongly flavored would throw it off.   Not a web dev, but a telecom engineer.  The reason I use OSX is because, while I love linux, I feel that it shines the most in a server rack, with a minimal install, where I can configure it to be an appliance that I know will be rocksteady into the future.  Trying to use it on a desktop is problematic. You configure it exactly as you desire, and then suddenly a new update thrashes your X config and suddenly you cant get a window manager to run, even in bulletproof mode. Some piece of hardware requires a hacky workaround to function (which is in itself a problem), and suddenly an update fixes the hacky workaround so the hardware is useless.  I used linux as a primary desktop os for 3 years, and it was a constant source of frustration for me. The above items were real problems, and the community couldn't help. So, when I switched to OSX,  it was great to know it had a BSD pedigree. A few choice apps/scripts like totalterminal in visor mode, and brew, and oh my ZSH, an updated python and perl install, and I had everything I wanted from linux but with excellent support. Or at least a guarantee that updates wouldn't suddenly lock me into a TUI mode.  That's not to say OSX doesn't have issues - it totally does. If you have a weird system problem that is very complex, good luck. Intelligent support is hard to find. The "geniuses" are a joke when you start trying to discuss deep system related problems. Most of them seem unable to do much more than look smug, sell, and wear skinny jeans. It also lacks features I'd love to see from *Nix (the proc filesystem for example).  All OS's are good. Some are just better at some stuff than others.   LOL, I kinda wanted to throw on some hot dogs just for profiling purposes. We have a ton of tofu in the freezer that we need to use, so I figured I would grill it. Next in the pipeline is a 13lb pork loin :)   Peanut butter eggs, chocolate legos, and some chocolate granola bark!      We have a bunch of tofu on hand, so I decided some grilled bbq tofu sandwiches with grilled pineapple on onion rolls were a nice way to go. Yum.      I'm pretty sure that the us code's definition of public accomodations prevents descrimination for any currently defined protected class, I don't think it has to be specifically listed. Again, I could be wrong :) IANAL!   Yeah! Glad you like... i was just thinking if two couples come in to your bakery, each asks for a cake that says "Congratulations Steve and Terry!" - the only difference between the gay and straight couple is the sex of Terry. That's our variable. And it is an established protected class.   https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/12181 is what public accomodations are.  I believe sex was one of the covered classes under the civil rights act of 1964, and further defined under the equal pay act, but let me doublecheck.   I would argue that it is a direct violation of federal law, as most of those companies are considered public accomodations, and their decision is being made based on the sex of one of the customers (and while sexuality isn't a protected class, sex IS).  Essentially, if I want to buy a cake and they would sell me one if my partner is a woman but not if my partner is a man, they are essentially discriminating based on sex of the person that I am with. If it is a business we are patronizing together, they are then directly discriminating against us based on sex.   Care to provide case law that a religion requires more than one follower?   Even easier: "This just in, Gencon has been disbanded. All assets and management have been purchased and hired by a new company, Jencon."  Oh sorry, that contract was with Gencon which is now defunct. So sorry.   Honestly, any politician dumb enough to sign this bill into law doesn't deserve to be president. The utter lack of foresight to think "Hm, I wonder if this will have a backlash that could make me unelectable" alone means he doesn't have what it takes to be POTUS.   Sort of. There's a lot of folks who simply can't vote because we're the only farking industrialized nation where election days aren't holidays. It is still quite easy for a boss to come in and tell his low-wage workers "yeah, I need you to come in and leave after polls close."   Final fantasy xii, if only because it is pretty much the only game in the main series currently unavailable on ps3.   I want that rosette.  Beautiful!    I absolutely agree. But some of the big ones are fun occasionally, if only to see some of the goofy stuff that gets posted :)      NEVER WANTS A PASSERBY TO PASS TO PASS HIM BY   While he has no problem poking fun at living people and putting them in farsical situations, I don't see him doing that. Likewise I don't think Mercury's family would let his life to be made into a farce.  So far the most serious roles I've seen him in was as the innkeeper in Les Miserables, Hugo, and Sweeney Todd. I think he can handle it.    Men are better than women at basically everything.  Everything includes more than physical.  FTA:   Counting standard deviations--the measurement of difference between sets of data--she shows how even the widest psychological differences, like physical aggression (0.60 standard deviations, leaning toward men) aren't as much as you might expect. Less than 0.10 standard deviations or between 0.11 and 0.35 standard deviations was common, and those are both defined as small differences. She also measured motor behaviors in boys and girls ages 3 to 20 to get a sense of the difference. Some of those, like grip strength (0.66, toward the gentlemen again), were large compared to the rest of the data, but still small to moderate overall. Throwing velocity and throwing distance? Both blowouts, at 2.18 and 1.98 standard deviations, respectively. Well above anything else, psychological or physical.   If you read the base article as well, the physical differences are actually not that big. Throwing is a major standout.   My grandfather had a shotgun he referred to as his "nigger gun"   It still is, just more of an r d patent factory these days in addition to being a driving force in really heavy computing.   Shadow of thr Colossus   Interestingly, thats not true. There are rather few distinct places where we are different in performance.  Surprisingly, women throw weaker than men. Beyond that, not too many differences.  http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-09/fyi-do-men-and-women-throw-ball-differently   I'd post a series of decent links.   Marriage.   Way longer than that. Speech to text/IVR is still years away from understanding normal speech to a point where it would be a full substitution for paid subtitles.  As mentioned, see the youtube example.  Nuance, one of the leaders in the field can't understand what you say if you have a stuffy nose as another example.  There are a ton more issues... accents, local jargon, professional words and jargon, people who speak other languages, telling one speaker from another, etc. It has come a long way over the past 20 years, but I think it could easily be 10 before really servicable, maybe 5 if the datamining stuff like siri and echo pays off   You know, now I want to start infecting USB drives with rootkits and shipping them back and forth internationally to see if any blips show up.   One thing I am pondering. Mycelium is also a young growth stage for fungi, including "magic mushrooms."  While mushroom spores are legal to ship, mycelium cultures are not.  I wonder if there is some sort of confusion going on? It's a stretch, but maybe.   I actually do know people who hate texas, but the majority have moved out. Thats probably part of the issue. Visit Austin if you get the chance, you'll meet a lot more people who are less proud of Texas.  But as for the personality of texans, there is a show on Netflix called "the shapes of our states" or something like that. They have an excellent episode on Texas. In general most Texans think of themselves as Texans first and Americans second.    The problem is the same as the US, which is why I'm drawing the parallel. The sense of exceptionalism, with a healthy dose of whitewashing history.  	145

I can't stand that it's one of his most popular songs. I always hear it on the radio and cringe. That is not a song Kanye would make now. And his feature on Katy Perry's E.T...    How is your self esteem?       I'm trying to find more videos like [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSCrre45vCE)  It reminds me of some sick fever dream I might have had as a child. I wouldn't mind getting stoned and watching something similar to this. Anybody know of any other videos like this?   Oh my GOD! I LISTENED TO THAT SONG SO MANY TIMES IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL!!! 5th grade, 2005, specifically! I really thought it was Weird Al. Me and my buddy used to jam out to this in his shed when we first learned how to use the internet on our own. There was a YTMND and I remember finally finding an mp3 of it and being so happy. My parents didn't like it when I sang it at the dinner table. Haha I'm so happy you made this post. Thank you, catthedd. You had an influence on some young children in Arizona.   Am I the only person that feels bad for her? I don't like how police officers are so ruthless.   I kind of like it. It's charming.   I believe you. I don't necessarily believe they stole your story per se, but I actually know a few people that have also written scripts for Jurassic Park IV that are eerily similar to Jurassic World. I think a lot of people have a lot of the same ideas of what they would want to see in a new JP film.   Jesus.

I am calling out you Bernie bots that conduct this daily circlejerk on reddit about the godliness of Bernie and the Satan like behavior of Hillary.   I can tell you I won't support Bernie though. And the reason is not him. It's you.   A group made up of blind supporters who blather endlessly over every word he says and condemns anyone or anything that does not worship him,   is called a cult. Sorry Nancy, I'm not joining any cults today.     This isn't a news article. It's propaganda from his own site.

This article says:   At least 5,500 Coloradans crammed into a Denver gymnasium, an adjacent atrium, and lacrosse field Saturday night to hear presidential candidate and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders speak, in what is being reported as one of the biggest political rallies so far in the 2016 election cycle.  Hillary rally had an estimate of 5,500 - 7000 people.   http://www.politicususa.com/2015/06/13/hillary-clinton-draws-biggest-crowd-2016-hopeful-nyc-rally.html  I have read three different numbers of the actual crowd but it was as large or larger than Bernie's.

Yeah I have the books but been too worried to read past the series.   you are right, it was honestly down to luck.

 I've had a lot of trouble getting the H4n to play nice with anything. What do you use with the Zoom that works well?   In that price range I always suggest the Rode NTG 2. Its a fairly good mic for the price and I think it's better than the Sennheiser ME66, which is a similarly priced mic.    A Harvest Nope   To be honest in that price range I'm not sure. I've used the NTG2 and NTG3 with the H4N and my biggest issue has always been that Phantom power is supplied to both xlr ports or neither. That being said the h6 is supposed to have new preamps right? I think the quality of the preamps are definitely most of the reason in price jumps before you add timecode.  I have used Sound Devices MixPre and 302 with the H4N and they don't play nice together.  Sound devices makes some sick toys like their new 633 mixer/recorder. Obviously way put of the H4n range but you can dream right?  	4

 I'm not much of a coffee man, myself. Prefer me a good ol' cuppa tea. PG Tips, preferably. (Comes with being English!)  But when I did have coffee, I had a Mocha. It's like a Hot Chocolate with a bit of a coffee-y taste to it.  Then I had an espresso a few weeks later without anything to eat. I was wired for an hour or two afterwards.   You've got a point on the LGBT(Q) getting a bit too long-winded  From what I've gathered being in the LGBT community for about a year, it's a support/awareness group  GSRM does encompass most orientations, even if a "new" one creeped up out of nowhere  Queer does sound a little out of place, to me, anyway. When I think og "Queer" I think of the old term - odd, different.    Eh, the menu I saw had those as the ingredients and that was the name.   I've never even heard of Apple Pucker.. Is that a US thing?   White Russian:  Some Vodka, Some Kahlua, Some Milk, Some Cream.  Mix to taste, pour over ice, Abide.   Also, an Applejack, tasty as hell: Jack Daniels, a shot of Jager and some Apple Juice (Cider in the US)   The way I'd put it is "Hey man, you know that money I lent you a while back? Yeah, it's cool. Happy Christmas!"   I'm studying with Train2Game - I work full time so learning from home is my only real option, and fuck going to uni with those fees!  I'm an ideas man, mostly story ideas, but give me a few hours and I can come up with a game and gameplay style to suit it. xP   Nifty! Love it, especially easy on the setup, too.   I'd love to come! Although I'm not very far in my Game Design course, so I feel I'd be mad out of place. Any chance I can just stand and watch? :P   Added myself!    I used Travel Master for a party of 12 down to Donington.. Return was included in my quote too!   We had a sneak preview at B.U.C.K.  From what we saw, it's pretty cool and shows a lot of stuff! Stories from Bronies, and most importantly, how awesomely we party!   [](/twiright)   Its like you just channelled me for a second there. So freaking excited!  I had no idea Meghan studied Mythology in College, that's going to be so interesting..  I can understand their love for world building, it's so much work, but it's fun and you can get your imagination out of your head and onto paper! A good world generally makes for a good story.    "Sup man?"    The way I've done it with my Social Networks is nifty (IMO)  I've used Facebook for IRL friends and acquaintences.  Twitter is for Companies and things I want to follow, NASA, etc  G+ was new ground for me. I found new people to follow. Made new friends and new interests spawned out of it.   Google+  It's a really smooth experience compared to facebook and twitter.  Facebook is a giant clusterfuck of Apps, games, tickers, chats..  Twitter is all #, @ and whatever else. Looks a bit like a Cid (FFVII) rant  G+ has a simple interface and really easy to use, and sharing to certain people is easy too, with circles.   Thank you! As a writer on EverfreeForest.com, I need something like this!  I don't have the time to read through all of EQD's posts for news, and when I come here, I just get distracted by all the awesome images and forget what I was doing!

There's the added bonus of leaves, which after a week on the ground become very slippery, and the wet weather does not help.  God help the guy who thinks it's awesome to ride his bike through a park.   I'd be 260k richer. Shave off 4 inches to become 5'10"   I'm going for my 3rd tat in a few weeks, this one is going to be a 4 hour session.  All I can say is, only have the tattoo to mark a period in your life you never want to forget. All 3 of mine (Well, one is going to be incorporated into my new one) have a meaning to it, so I can never regret it.   I think it's a universal thing. I like to see where the needles are going, I can't see inside my own mouth unfortunately. A mirrror into my mouth would only make it worse, weirdly enough.  I've had about 4 hours of tattooing already, going for another 4 in a few weeks, but I cant get a jab in the gum from a dentist, I need to go under completely for someone to go in my mouth.  coming from a Brit, what's a Beta Blocker?   Me and Dentists.. Nah man. I'm suffering from some really bad toothache, but I refuse to go back to my dentist.  Last time I went, he took a tooth but missed a bit. Instead of drilling or whatever some more, he just grabbed his tweezer-things, clamped onto it, wriggled it to loosen it, then yank it out.  I was _not_ looking forward to the anaesthetic wear-off, not one bit.   Currently, Warehouser. I'm going into Remote Software Training come the 22nd though. :D     Sounds like my Border Collie, absolutely loses his shit when new people appear.   Looks like a Border Collie mixed with a.. Ah, I can't remember the name. That facial structure - I can just tell!  He's adorbs, how much of a shithead is he?   Your engine needs to be converted for that.  If you put cooking oil, or water into your tank, it'll fuck your engine bigtime.   Mine's white. Gets dirty well quick, but I only pay 98 a month on it, so I can't complain!   [Toyota Aygo](http://tajdrivingschool.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Toyota-Aygo-Platinum-111.jpg). :D Gets roughly 60MPG   I can't be anywhere unsecure in the dark. Public parks at night on my own? Nope. This place is miles out of town, I go all the time and I still make a beeline for the exit when the sun starts setting.   My car normally get a good 70km out of a "block", so I'll mill about for 40km before filling up, just to be safe.   I'm feeling the pressure more these days, I'm on social networks a lot more, and I see brand new games getting a lot of hype and being talked about.   Sometimes I felt like I could only join in if I got the game and played it!  Unfortunately, my wage doesn't allow me to buy games right off the bat, so by the time I get round to buying and playing, the focus has shifted off that game and onto another.   Don't forget Geordie Shore..    We both know all of reddit is just two guys. Me and you. Stop talking to yourself, man!   At home? I have an ornamental axe. It's actually quite sharp and I cut my hand on it while mounting it on the wall.  Also, an Airsoft M4. I'd probably just bug them. Go for the eyes!   I'm 22, still at home. I balanced my budget and with what I was earning, I couldn't get out. My parents are happy to keep me anyway. :   I was doing my paper round on my bike. Had to make a quick turnaround - missed one of the houses. Slammed on the front brake by mistake.  Front flipped over the handlebars and landed on my back. Paper bag full of Sunday Papers promptly landed on me, followed by my bike. Shit hurt for weeks.   Yeah. Ah well, it's only Karma. Felt like sharing my desk anyway.    I'm a bit of a mix of both here. I'm a brony, but I despise those who post damn near everything about ponies.   I keep my ponies to the relevent subs, but my avatars (almost everywhere) are ponies. I try to be very pony quiet - posting ponies only in /r/mylittlepony and the fansite I'm on (for ponies) and I keep discussion relevent everywhere else  The avatars throw people right off though, but I just like the pastel coloured bastards so much.   I have a bunch, mostly on the fly, so daft easy to type with Swype, like "Whee" "Thing" "Damn" "Fuck"      He's driving in the overtaking lane. As a rule, you're meant to stay in the left lane at all times, unless you're overtaking.

Not as busy as you are, though I'm working full time as a Warehouse guy, transitioning into a new role as a Software trainer, I'm doing a CompTIA A+ and Network+ course, as well as a Game Design course.

I was awkwardly hanging around, my other buddies being on holiday. He and a group of his friends saw me and thought it'd be nice to keep me company while my old buddies were away.

Make sure it's songs you know, though. Concentrating more on the music rather than the road could make it worse.

If they caught up to him in the current time, they might see him get taken away by themselves. Much like when The Doctor and Rose went back to see Rose's dad, then went back again and saw themselves watching Rose's dad.   Mass Effect 3 was outstanding, the original ending was a bit deflating, but with the extended cut, I actually cried with the ending I picked.  A game has never done that to me, a fitting end for the 5 years I'd been playing the previous 2.   Mine's probably just past my shoulders now, due to mad working hours, I've just been tying it up in a ponytail.  When I get the chance, or when I'm going out places, I give it a quick wet, comb it back and apply some gel/hairspray to make it stay. Doesn't take too long.  Myself, I just tie it up in a plain ponytail, or just let it loose and let it do it's own thing.   Fuck.  Get out of my head, good sir.   This is where cars live! Git you one!   I still haven't watched the entire Star Wars collection, Alien, Terminator, and most other "must watch" classics.  I always get "What, you've _never_ watched that?!" when asked about any of them.   Yeah, it's an odd one.   Ponies, Vore and.. uh... more ponies, really.   First and Only...  Man, used to play with those guys back in Rochdale..

Yeah, we're dickheads most of the time, but all you need to do is look for the good, and it totally outweighs the bad stuff.  Plus, what's the fun in ending yourself?   Not to picky - but even in a relationship, I'm not really... sexual, if you get me. Sorry if I gave off the wrong impression! I meant Hetero-demiromantic  as in I feel I can only feel right in a romantic-only relationship with the opposite gender.    I am stapler man!  ... I believe you have my stapler? Give it to me.  **fires staples at passing mugger*   "Yeah, yeah. That's cool."   I'm a 22/Male/Demi-HeteroRomantic  the best way I can see about doing this is getting AMA volunteers marked via Flair in /r/IAmA for the day or something - though that's down to the mods there..  I'm free most nights (6pm onwards). Weekends almost all day. (I'm in GMT) I can pull an allnighter if you need a few more answerers :D   Alright, now, it's been a while since my last encounter with him, but it happened again last night and it totally freaked me the hell out. I'm not looking forward to locking up tonight, anyway..  It's getting darker these days, though that's pretty much irrelevant here in the Warehouse. There's no windows. When 5:30pm comes rolling around, I'm the last guy in the place.   Like clockwork, I set my handheld scanner down, grab the keys and begin locking the metal gates around the warehouse and turning the lights off. After a round trip through the office to get to the "front" of the warehouse, so I can grab my coat and keys and go home, I can hear one of the gates rattling.  I work with a prankster - so even though I've encountered this.. thing before, I always assume it's my coworker in another department. I grab the keys and start to unlock.   "C'mon man, quit fucking about, I was just about to go home!"  No reply. Not like him at all. Normally he'd fall out of his hiding place and roll about laughing. I quickly remove the keys from the lock and start to back up. There it was. Stood by the gate opposite the one I was at. Just standing there, hunched over. Despite my fears and I just *knew* it was that thing again, I said "Sorry mate, can I help you?" regardless. Clients and Visitors do sometimes pass through the warehouse.  His head turned. Slowly at first. Then - **SNAP** - his head had rotated 180 degrees. The last 90 degrees almost instantly. I stumbled backwards, almost forgetting there was a metal gate between me and it. He didn't even move, but he was right at the gate now. It was almost like he teleported right close to the gate.  Its face... I can't even describe it without getting weirded out majorly. It looked almost like a wax figure that was left out in the hot sun a bit too long. But he had these holes for eyes.  It reached its hand through the gate and pointed at me. "You.." It sounded like a breath . "You.." It repeated  I bolted. I slammed the final door behind me and locked it, and ran past the rest of the office, much to the bemusement of the guys in that department who were just finishing up.  They never knew what I saw. I hope they don't either. That thing was petrifying.    Excellently written. I'd love a guardian spirit, though my dog will have to do, I guess. :P   I'd be up for it :)  It'd be neat-o if we got a wide range of [x]romantics and aromantics, genders and ages too.   Got it!

Maan, never go to PC world. They will try and sell the most expensive thing they can. It's probably in their training.   Thanks! Very informative. We give him antihistamines in his food, which usually does the trick. I'll keep on top of it next year.   We've had our Border now for about 10 years, and every year in the Sept/Oct period, he gets very itchy and starts nibbling in the area just above his back leg. He eventually gets bald in the area, so we're always telling him to stop nibbling/scratching. I took a close look today and it looked very odd.  We can be also petting him on the back, and he start twitching one (or both) of his back legs. Seems a very ticklish or sensitive reaction, but he doesn't back off once he's done reacting - if anything, he comes and puts his head in our laps like he liked it  We've been to the vets, and they seem to give him a dose of anti-allergy stuff, because we put that in his food and he stops right away.  I'm wondering if it is just seasonal allergies in a dog, or something completely different.  [Images of the baldspot, for the curious](http://imgur.com/a/AnEeW)   This is true. Ah well, we can only hope, eh?   For a minute there, I thought in my absence from the Internet, I missed the news of Maggie's death.    Might be down along with GoDaddy, even the [front page of FRW](http://www.freedomrequireswings.com/) is down..   Yep. Was at Download Fest this year, was on the Fun House and there was a bit of a queue for the slide down, so me and my group were waiting. I was at the back  These drunk girls were behind us, yelling about the wait, and for 10 minutes, my arse was being fondled like a stress ball. Was not happy.  Should add, really: I told 'em 3 or 4 times to cut it out. Eventually I just gave up and resigned to my fate as living stress ball.   I decide that driving that forklift truck over there would be pretty funny, and I've no idea how that thing works. I turn it on and go for a spin. I impale a man on the forks, then ram him into a wall.   I know it's had huge popularity recently, but Gangnam Style has got to be seen, funny as hell, and the song is annoyingly catchy!  But another one has to be [No One Knows - Queens of the Stone Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88r_q7oufE)   I always waste their time when they ring me or text me. "Yeah, I've got a credit card. Yeah, it's only for 750. What's that, your fees are almost that? Why did you even bother telling me I could claim 2k then?   Fuck off."   Same with Co-op. Hopefully it is just restricted to Mobile/Online.  Not like Co-op's online is any good anyway. It's total arse - maybe they're updating!   I've been a part of our Diplomatic Circuit since we emerged onto the Universal Stage - it's been about 10 years now. We're new, but I can already tell there is corruption, especially in the Milky Way, luckily, we have a few politicians who do have morals and are trying their best to counter any bad moves, but some bad ideas do slip the net.  If you ask me, we need more people on the Universal council - Currently, there is only 1 representative from each galaxy on the council, as well as 4 members elected directly onto it, completely neutral - which makes about 20 people on the council altogether. Considering that they're in charge of almost everyone in the universe, I think more people should be allowed to have their say.  Also, there is only 1 Feln in the Universal council - obviously, we would like more.. We are new, though, so people are quite surprised Kur'jin is up there with them.    When we initially set off from our homeworld, we weren't too technically advanced, compared to the rest of the species' advancement - We set off without FTL drives, so before the Canir found us, we we just drifting, in comparison to their speeds. We had pretty fast engines, though. We could cross our System within a few weeks.   Though our World-ship was a different story, it took us the best part of a year to get out of our system with it!  The universe is.. how would Humans say it.. Ah, Free-market. We have FTL drives, Galaxy Gates, Intergalaxy expressways. Basically, you can almost get from one side of the explored universe to the other within a decade or two!   As for personal tech, we're very much an Augmented universal society. You can get Augs for almost anything these days, mostly due to Innovation in the Milky Way Galaxy.. They have questionable methods, though. Loopholes and all that. They're very crafty over there.  As for humans and their previously war-like ways, they appear to have settled some since making first contact. Mostly due to their home planet being made almost uninhabitable a few years after starting to colonise nearby systems. As the saying goes. "You learn from your mistakes - only a fool makes it twice". They imposed sanctions on themselves - which stunned the rest of us, really. Well, I say us, we weren't exactly off our planet yet.   War isn't an issue, yet. For the Feln, at least - I try my best to keep our tails out of the fire, but that hasn't been too much of a problem, really. It's been pretty peaceful up here, aside from the slavers out on the "eastern" side of the Andromeda, and the cowboy implanters out in the Milky Way. Oh yeah, and the Mercs which you can't seem to dodge are always kicking up some kind of fuss. We stay out of their way, though - They just fight each other.  By no means is it an utopia, though. Only places such as here, in the High-Sec stations and the Canir capital city.   Yes, one thing the Humans, Canir and the Feln had in common were the fact that in our early documented history, we were all highly religious and wars were foughts not only over land and resources, but wars were also fought in.. well, the Humans called them the Crusades, the Feln and Canir have similar words - We called them the Deims, although the Humans went much further in their Crusades.  There are many other similar things, we had multiple dialects - but while the Humans have maintained their multiple languages, the Feln almost unified their languages before we achieved space flight - the Canir keep two separate languages too.   Well said! I run around the park with my Border Collie, and he's usually happy to trot up to any other dog and sniff butts, but any little dog will see him coming and I have to stop and leash mine, because one of the little terrors is barking like a maniac.  It breaks mine and his running flow. :(   We originate from the "Northern" section of the Milky Way Galaxy, a small system named after our star - Junl - There were just 4 planets in our system.  Each galaxy has their own set of laws, so to speak, though many overlap - it was much like the Human's.. continents, I think they were called.. Each Galaxy has their own ruling council, which all answer to the Universal council.  Only upon breaking a Galaxy's law, will you be pursued. The Milky Way council has a pretty harsh time with Aug Docs, and they're forever finding and closing loopholes.  Our relationship with the Humans is pretty stable, I try to keep the peace between us, but we were - and still are - quite a.. religious bunch, with the Human's religions, many wars were fought in the name of religion - but ours is very much a peaceful one. We merely worship our ancestral animals, which we believe we descended from - Evolution, if you will.  The humans - or most, at least - are quite wary of religion. A brief study on their history would explain why. We ask our people not to worship in public, as this may lead to raised tensions. Though 2 times a week, I'll get an angry comm from the Human ambassador - not like I can do anything about it anyway.   We, the Feln, first encountered the Humans - officially, at least - on the main council fleet. There was no tension between us, at least. Humans were pretty new to the Universal Society too, they must have been there about 60 or 70 years before us.  As for diplomatic situations, the Canir allowed us to us their Research posts on one of their colonies, and access to the shipyard so we could make our own scouting fleet. We needed a homeworld before we could establish ourselves in the universe - we would not be allowed a place among the Universal Council otherwise.  As for the Canir, we view them as saviours, though we were very much self sufficient on our World-ship. The Canir found our World-ship adrift between systems. they discovered our communication methods, gave signs of peace, and boarded the ship. Everyone on ship was on edge, including myself, who were these... Aliens who had found us, what were they doing?    They took us to the Council Fleets, where our high-ranked officials met council leaders and diplomats. I was picked for Diplomatic duty, and I mostly talk with the Canir and the Humans, hence my history studies.    Feel Free to add me! I feel I need some encouragement on using the site,  I'm train_subject8542 on there too.   Aye, the camera is pretty awesome. Once I ditch this thing, I'll be keeping it as a camera.  I'm not sure what Helicoptering is in this context, but I'm going to assume it's bad.    I'm also a history buff, and have quite the stack of Feln, Canir and Human history books littered all over my desk.   I haven't quite gotten to the rest of the universe, but I'm getting there!  [D'oh! Forgot the Fiction tag, apologies!]   /r/getmotivated gets me off my chair if I'm feeling lazy before my runs.   The Google Nexus 7 is pretty good value for money.  159.99 and 199.99 versions are out here in the UK, and they run pretty well, supposedly. I've not got one, but I'd love one!   I've got an N8. The software feels like it's being dragged through cement, but the amout of times I've dropped it on concrete is silly, and all I've got is a few scratches.  I also launched it across the room after it refused to answer a call 3 times in a row. (I was having a shitty day)   I live somewhat near them, so I use [Micro Direct](http://www.microdirect.co.uk) for stuff.   The few times I've had faulty stuff, I've just driven in and said "It no work!" And they give me a new one on the spot   That's all I got for ages in my inbox. I like them. So what?   Yeah, but they're not metal. More Hard Rock if anything.   I was in /r/metal, and the question "as it's July 4th, what are your favourite american metal bands?"   Now, I'm not American, but I jumped in, and answered "Killswitch Engage and Disturbed" I understand I was wrong about Disturbed, but Jesus Christ I got absolutely hammered in the comments/downvotes   Graveyards. If I'm totally unaware we're going into one, I'll freeze on the spot.  Made my Nan's funeral pretty tense, as well as sad for me.   I've seen them about for a while, heck they were about when I was at school (I left Secondary in '06), but I never actually saw anyone with it assembled.  Anyone who wears this in a town or city centre needs a kicking, It'd be good for when it's pissing down when you're out hiking..  Who am I kidding, if I was out hiking and saw someone wearing one of them, I'd flip and run the opposite direction.   Stealing cake. Just wait until they're at some kind of party, and they have a slice of cake.  BAM  Stolen.   We think they are, as almost immediately after building the final expressways, they backed off immediately. There is an unfinished Galaxy Gate over on the Andromeda. They left an "always on" signal warning people not to use it. It's completely dead, though, so why they warned us not to use it seemed a bit redundant.  Yeah, the ships are built with the gateways in mind, though these gates are huge, they're at least a few kilometers tall - The Feln made quite a surprise entrance after the Canir found them. Their ship was huge!  Scientists and Engineers have mapped out the expressways, and the Galaxy Gates, and are in attempts to reverse engineer their schematics, but its proving quite difficult.   As for holding them ransom, that would be quite silly, really. The express gates are one of a kind in each solar system. Without them, there's no way in, or out, apart from conventional FTL drives, the pirates know without it, they're going to waste a lot of money should no-one pay the ransom and they destroy the gate.  As for camping - well, the Admirals of each galaxy have huge warships capable of mass destruction, Pirates don't really stand much of a chance against them. It's been done a few times before, and never again since.  ((sorry that took so long, working on two projects at once, I know. Derp. Got so absorbed in one, I forgot to reply here))   I'm a manual labourer, might soon be entering a software training role, but I aspire to be a Game Designer, and possibly write a novel.  My current worldbuilding project is probably going to be the subject of my first novel, if I ever get around to it.      A currently existing race built the gates, but they went reclusive after building them, no schematics exist, and they refuse to speak to diplomats sent out to speak to them.  They're very large structures in space, very rectangular in shape, you can see a lot of the machinery and workings underneath most of them. I think they left the "covers" off to dissipate the heat that is generated when gate travel is made. Due to that, they look very strange, Wireframe-y, with a giant hole in the centre, which any ship can fit through.  FTL is possible without the gates, though it uses quite a bit of fuel when you go over anything than 3x. Most use the inter-galaxy "Expressways" when making a trip way across the same Galaxy. These use similar technology, but, unlike the Galaxy Gates, they're not instantaneous, They can accelerate your ship to 500x the speed of light, which makes a trip from one end of the Galaxy to the other about 180 years (Still a bit long, but for the rest of the Galaxy's species, that's about two thirds of a lifetime.) (That would be impractical anyway, the "top" and "bottom", as well as either "Side" of all currently accessible Galaxies have the main gates)  As for conventional ungated FTL, a ship fitted with FTL engines reaches such speeds through particle manipulation, mostly. Thrusters kick in, helping the FTL Core charge the ship with the energy provided to  manipulate the ship and the area around it. With the charge building up, approaching planets or other large structures, it becomes a bit dangerous. Most ships will drop charge on outer planets, or, there being none available, a "Charge Drop" is constructed, where ships can pass and lose their built up charge. This is required after every FTL trip, or else the Particle Manipulation charge can hit a populated area. It is a combination of electricity and radioactive charge. Very deadly.   It's tough.

Kinda wish I had thought to go to Tom Brown or a Greenway, but I think it turned out okay.      Knowing the retconned it in the movies has ruined it for me.   I was expecting this one. http://i.imgur.com/8orgM.jpg   I live in Tallahassee, FL. While I understand that legally I am obliged by the lease, receiving a note saying that I have an extra 3 days to pay rent is huge, especially for a poor college student. The current managers claim to have been there since the beginning of June, and they didn't seem to have a problem with payment on the 5th last month. Now I'm just thinking it was some sort of ploy from the previous owners now just to throw in one last monkey wrench into a sinking ship.   New apartment managers are trying to screw me by saying I owe a late fee, even though the month prior we had received a note saying that the rent due date had been changed to the 5th, with even the receptionist confirming that was the case. Paid rent on the 5th of June without issue. This month, go in to the office to pay rent on the 5th only to be informed that we owed a late fee because our rent was due on the 2nd, as per the original lease contract that was signed with the 3rd or 4th previous apartment management company. Management seems to change every couple months, so its incredibly confusing. I no longer have the original note stating the change of due date, but I'm hoping one of our neighbors still does.

 Reuptake is saturable: a finite amount of glucose can be taken back up at a time. The amount of glucose in the blood in the absence of insulin exceeds the amount that transporters can move per unit time. Thus, out goes the glucose...and out goes water with it, for that matter.   I'm a vascular physiologists, so know that my response is definitely from that perspective - and not from the neuroscience perspective. That being said, my guess is that the cause of dehydration-induced headaches is two-fold:  (1) Dehydration decreases blood volume, which causes blood vessels in the body to constrict to maintain blood pressure at a high enough level to properly deliver oxygen/nutrients to your organs. This includes vessels in your head (outside of the skull), which might lead to headache.  (2) Your brain will do anything and everything to maintain blood flow to it, even at the expense of the rest of your body. So, when a drop blood volume also lowers blood pressure, the vessels in your brain do the opposite from the rest of the body: they dilate. Cerebral vessel dilation has also been attributed to development of "throbbing" headaches.  On a side note - exactly how vascular changes cause the headache is still debated, since it seems that both vasodilation and vasoconstriction result in head pain. Somewhere along the line, these vascular changes activate pain-sensing nerve fibers, but several mechanisms for that activation have been hypothesized. We're trying to figure it out, I promise. (c:  --  Sources: [PubMed Central] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=vascular+causes%20of%20headache), your home for free full-text science articles.

As far as benefits go, I think that's constantly evolving - take the paper in question, for example. There are thousands of papers citing the benefits of caffeine in everything from gallstones to Parkinson's disease. Most all of this, however is correlation and not causal relationships...it's still unclear (in my opinion) the link between caffeine and all these other maladies. I think the benefits readily accepted right now are the ability of caffeine to increase alertness and act as a vasodilator; t's also used for some very specific airway disorders. But this is balanced against the diuretic effects, the dependence potential, the increase in heart rate, headache, and the jittery feelings people get. As with most anything, though, the dangers go up as the dose goes up.  	4
                                          they just want attention.  They think they have a god given right to attention.   I'm sure they write angry letters to the TV Networks demanding to know why they aren't regularly interviewed on the morning and late night talk shows.                    Pretty simple and straight forward interpretation.   The author of it is admitting that he's an idiot who doesn't know what he is talking about.   Of course, he's not aware of that, but then...  he's not aware of a lot of things.                 I think I'm going to wait to read a recap of the recap threads.    And moderators are more evil than were Bormann, Himmler, Heydrich, Goebbels or even Hitler.   But Gring was really evil, cause he was over weight.   Reddit has it's standards to uphold after all.    Maybe they are /u/Warlizard's.     And hating moderators who work for evil Jewish Space Lizards.                  I would gladly pay the admins for their trouble.    $6.73 and an old 386 DX 40 motherboard to the admin who makes it happen.     It's even a rather simple and straight forward thing to get unshadow-banned.  All one has to do is say to the admins "I'm sorry, I won't do that again.  Please give me a second chance".   Sure, the admins probably won't give them a 17th chance, but 2nd and 3rd chances are not unusual for the admins to grant.    The problem with most of the people babbling about conspiracies are that they never think they go too far.   Since calling the parents of school shootings victims and accusing them of being actors doesn't cross a line for them.... that just means breaking a few the rules of Reddit isn't going to cause them any moral qualms in the least.     It also sounds like the Christians who always talk about the non-existent war-on-Christmas.    Cause the holiday that controls something like ~half the American economy is in danger of being over shadowed by something else.   Probably the evil Sierra Club and Arbor-day.              This whole scandal is about the ethics in lying.     Big SJW take over.   So efficient that nobody noticed.   Now it's time to unleash the ultimate weapon.

Admins can do whatever they want with regards to the site. If you don't like it, leave.  Hey, we're not going to get this wish.  They will never leave.  Instead they will just bitch and throw a fit for.... as long it's interesting to them.   As soon as a new cat video comes along, they'll watch that and not leave.     Yes, they should leave.  For the love of all that is both holy and unholy they should leave.   But we're not going to get that lucky.      As always, I trust your judgement, Jax.

 Thanks! I'm glad to hear the FAVI is good hardware, I had definitely considered it previously, and may pick one up. I'm currently using a Microsoft multimedia keyboard, although the FAVI is much smaller  I've previously used XBMC on a raspberry pi and it was impressive given the hardware.

Some ideas I'm currently thinking of are:  -Several flush mounted USB chargers for charging phones and other devices  -imbedded tablet(s) to control home automation and act as a control for my home theater server  -small ITX computer built within the table... not sure what I would do for a screen... Possible wireless display?   I would love any other cool ideas or designs before I start delving into this project! Thanks!   Thanks!   I use Insteon home automation products which you can completely control from your phone, tablet, computer, etc.  I replaced most of the light switches in my house with the 521 flush-mounted in the wall with the Insteon app always up. That way I can turn the light on/off/dim like a normal light switch, or control any other connected device (cameras, garage door, other lights, etc)  To answer your question, they are very easy to setup yourself!   Mine's FBI Surveillance Van. My neighbor is a contractor and always has a white Ford Econoline parked out front :)    Yep! This was resolved when it went from Windows Phone 8 to 8.1. It Drove me crazy too! You can download the Preview for Developers to get 8.1 if your phone isnt normally eligible.    929 (Icon) and 830... represent!   In all fairness, you're talking about a $50 phone, where as almost every other smart phone on the market is ten times the price.   That being said, I use 521's as home automation light switches and never have issues. I would see if there's a Microsoft Store near you and stop in, if your phone is indeed defective, they'll swap it if its under warranty.   I'm currently using uTorrent (latest version) and getting my torrents from TPB. Most downloads won't go over ~100kb/s and are constantly jumping around from (20kb/s to 70kb/s back and forth). Speedtest is giving me 16Mb/s and I can direct download from sites at over 1Mb/s.  Also, This is happening on all torrents, whether they have 100 seeders and 5 leechers, or the newest Walking Dead with 17,000S/500L. I'm so confused!  Any guesses as to why my torrent speeds seem so limited?! Thanks!   As per my post above, I agree ;)   The developer preview of 8.1 runs really well on my Icon as well as many of my friends without issue. Its free to sign up and get it! Feel free to PM me and I can give you instructions on how to get it.   Disclaimer: I work for Microsoft :P   Pretty much any place that sells oil, will take it back. Walmart, any large auto parts stores, and most friendly mechanics will take the oil.   http://www.monoprice.com/Product?c_id=108 cp_id=10823 cs_id=1082707 p_id=9957 seq=1 format=2  $5   If you're not concerned about installing programs, the original Surface RT with a keyboard is super durable, has like 9 hours battery life, and comes with Office installed. You can generally find them on sale for ~$150. If installing full function programs is required, I would follow everyone else's advise and grab a refurb of a deal website.  Also, check out dealnews.com daily. Its a great site that occasionally will find some killer deals on laptops (and more!)  Disclaimer: I work for Microsoft   You really only need jack stands or ramps to lift your car, a socket and wrench to fit the drain plug, an oil filter wrench, a funnel, and a oil pan. You may want a breaker bar (extra long for leverage) if your drain plug or filter are on tight. All of those will cost you ~$60-90 at Harbor Freight, Lowes, or Sears. Oil is $12-25 depending on whether you have regular or synthetic, and a new filter is $5-$15 depending on how fancy you want it.  All that being said, you can generally find coupons or deals to get your oil and filter changed for $20-25. This is the same price as if you did it, and you don't have to get dirty...unless of course you want to get dirty :)   Buy a Haynes manual from an auto parts store. For less than $30, this manual (which is specific to your car) will tell you how to do basic maintenance all the way to in-depth engine teardown and trouble-shooting. All the tools you'll need can be picked up at Harbor Freight for much cheaper than an auto parts or home improvement store. 3 Ton jacks and an auto toolkit (sockets, wrenches, etc) will put you back less than $100 and will enable you to do almost all your car maintenance yourself.  As OP said, if you don't feel comfortable doing it, seek a professional. Having your car half torn apart and realizing you don't know what you're doing put you in an awkward position to get your car to the mechanic.    I've lived here for ~4.5 years... I'll look into this! Thank you!   As stated, I recently moved to a new city and have been staying in an extended stay hotel ($$$$). I had the assumption the entire time that I would be buying another house, but started to consider renting as I know I will be moving again in about 2 years.  My biggest concern is that I'll be gaining $17,500 on the sale of the house. If I put that towards a down payment of a new house... no tax! If I decide to rent, I'll lose about $7,000 to taxes and would like that money to be used as a down payment on the home I know I'll be purchasing after my next move. Is there an account or way to avoid getting money taxed?    Thanks! I believe I do need the sensor. I cleared the code and I've put about 150 miles on it without the code being tripped again... False positive??!   I got a check engine light the other day and checked the code (P0128) stating that the coolant thermostat was having issues. I've checked everything else on this coolant system and it seems fine, which leads me to believe I need to replace the thermostat.  I'm having two main issues finding a replacement. First, there are many ~$30 options that don't have a sensor and many ~$150 options that DO have a sensor. How would I determine if I need to also replace the sensor and save a hundred bucks. Second, all the thermostats have different temperature ratings (most are 180, 190, or 208 degrees). I checked my Haynes manual which states that the thermostat should start opening at 194 degrees and be fully open at 223. How do I know which temp to choose from?  Thank you all for any assistance! It's greatly appreciated   Yea, it definitely is! I used to competitively row and for warmups/training we had to keep our splits (500m) below 1:45 for up to 10km. In perspective, 7km at 1:45/500m is 24.5 minutes.   Although I no longer row, I still use an erg for exercise. One thing that works really well for me is pick a split time, say 2:00, and DO NOT GO ABOVE IT. you can then either set a time or distance to match. It tends to be a little more grueling since you can't really stop or relax, but gives you a better idea of your overall fitness.   -Skagway brewing is owned my locals, not cruise lines. -I do not have an exact percentage but most. If you take the jewelry stores out of the pictures its almost 100% owned locally.  -Haines and Skagway are like brother/sister towns. Many of the business's in Skagway are owned by people in Haines which is a 15 minute boat ride. It's kind of like living in the suburbs and working downtown.   -As far as "cruise ship fronts", Haines does not really cater to tourism, especially compared to Skagway which thrives from it. That being said, just because there's some touristy knick-knack shop doesn't mean its owned by the cruise lines, its just someone being opportunistic.   I hope you liked Haines... its gorgeous!   I don't know why other people are replying yes, the cruise lines do not own the all or even most business's. Most business's and excursions are privately owned. I have heard that several of the jewelry companies are owned (or have heavy stakes in) Princess and Royal Caribbean, but Skagway has something like ~30-40 jewelry shops.  That all being said, the cruise lines DO have a lot of sway over things. For instance, the excursion I led was ~$70/person if you walked into the shop or called ahead of time, we would pick you up at the dock. If you book the EXACT same excursion through say Princess, it'll be like $110/person but Princess will take $70 and give my shop $40. In my case particularly, the excursion was owned by an awesome guy who was legitimately upset that people were getting gouged and he was making half, but without the cruise lines advertising for you, you'd go out of business. The same was relatively true for most business's in the area.   Nice! I worked at Sockeye Cycle a few years ago... Skagway is like the best summer vacation ever, but you get paid :)   Your title doesn't make sense. Try re-wording it and re-post.   I also have a V5 and would be happy to do a step-by-step hard drive removal guide if you would be up for trying. The only tool you would really need is a #0 Phillips screw driver.   I agree with others that there's a really good chance your hard drive just got dislodged.  Let me know!   In addition to the scanners you've already run, [ADW Cleaner](https://toolslib.net/downloads/finish/1/) does a really good job at cleaning up adware remains. It searches through folders, services, registry, startup tasks, and all of your browsers. Super quick and easy :)   AMD may make the technology that goes into the card, but they don't actually produce it themselves. I believe the Windforce card you have is actually produced by Gigabyte.  You have two options. Contact wherever you purchased the card (Amazon, Newegg, Best Buy, etc.) and see if they can exchange it for you under their policies. This is generally easiest, but since it was purchased in December, it will probably be outside of their exchange/return policy. Your other option is contacting Gigabyte [HERE](http://ggcs.gigabyte.com/GIGABYTE-RMA-Login-User.aspx), create an account and begin your RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) process. They may ask you to troubleshoot some things first or run their own tests.  Hope that helps, and good luck!  EDIT: There is still a chance it's the PSU failing and not providing enough power. Given that the test ran for 15 minutes before it failed however, I would find this highly unlikely as the card is requiring max power consumption immediately.    Perfect! On Lenovo's there is generally a special recovery button that looks like a [U-turn symbol](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_UpiBAokjaoY/TDrZk8a334I/AAAAAAAAF_o/gIM0z3xqsSc/DSC01675.JPG?imgmax=800) Normally its next to the power button, but sometimes its on the side. With the laptop completely off and connected to the monitor, hit the recovery button. The computer will turn on and should go into the recovery console instead of Windows.  If that works let us know, and we can go from there. Good luck!   Yes, there is.  Most modern (post-XP era) computers have recovery partitions in them. Depending on your devices manufacturer, the process in utilizing that partition can be different. If you could tell us what OS and brand your computer is, I would be happy to give you more accurate instructions.   You re-paste your laptops CPU everymonth?! Doesn't that seem excessive? Decent paste is rated for several years, so maybe changing it yearly would make sense.  In all seriousness though, I've very curious is you have a reason for re-applying so often. Thanks!  	32
 Havanese, actually    I pooped in various places around my school. Got caught.   Captain Phillips. Didn't expect to like it so much.   I solved it myself! Took me a while, but I realized it may not have been a movie. In fact, it was a Muppets special called The Frog Prince. Can't believe it's taken me so long to find this, been searching for like two years.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9YMg6oBFHQ  	4
    Somebody say bacon?   http://i.imgur.com/i7sn7Sc.gif   https://i.imgur.com/G2POrME.gif   Honestly, this looks pretty damn good.   I love this.   The way Netflix categorizes it their is.

That's impressive!   Thank you so, so much friend. Like I said in my post, I'll repay your kindness once I'm back on my feet. This means a lot to me.   I appreciate the kind words, its nice knowing I'm not the only one who feels this way. *hugs*   Thank you for the kind words :) *Hug*   My name's Josh. I have OCD, GSA, depression, ADD, insomnia, and bipolar disorder. I'm out of work because of it, and its made mine and my family's life very hard. I'm currently seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, who are working with me step by step.  I'm here to ask for help. My anxiety has been getting harder and harder to cope with, and I need help. When I was working I would sometimes visit a natural market and buy powdered valerian root to make tea, it would ease my anxiety and I loved it because it was all natural. I'm hoping someone here can sympathize and understand how horrible dealing with these problems can be, and can extend a helping hand. I will in turn repay you for your kindness when I'm able to, though I'm not sure when that will be. I have an appointment with my psych next week and were supposed to discuss my med regimen.  I'm asking if someone can pay for this powdered valerian they sell on Amazon. Its about $10 including shipping, and 4oz lasts a long time. Somebody please help me, I'm tired of crying because I can't deal with my anxiety.  *http://amzn.com/w/X193L1WAPXEU  *Internet hugs*   This is my all-time favorite Bertstrip ever.   Psycho.

 Do you honestly believe that she stepped down because she wasn't competent enough?    Just out of curiosity, how are you qualified to know about everything the job requires and what makes you such a capable judge on Pao's competence?

 It's hard to tell, but from my what I've seen from Manning this season, I just highly doubt he has another season in him. But the question is, who are you grabbing at QB towards the end of the 1st round that has the potential to be a franchise QB?   There's actually a documentary about him that's pretty interesting. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1352717/  "John Cazale was in only five films - The Godfather, The Conversation, The Godfather, Part Two, Dog Day Afternoon, and The Deer Hunter - each was nominated for Best Picture. Yet today most people don't even know his name. I KNEW IT WAS YOU is a fresh tour through movies that defined a generation."  Edit: Wow, I didn't expect my simple post to blow up that much. Also, thanks for the gold!   Crash Bandicoot is the Mario of Sony for me. I miss that guy.   See, I read this as "Yes...if Peyton Manning is still here." Do you think DT wants to spend the prime of his career with Osweiler/whoever else we come up with? I think it sounds nice, but I would guess we need to pay up if Peyton retires after this season.   Well, that's certainly better than a 24 hour marathon of just Deer Hunter.   Thanks! It's normally two of my friends, one is my high school best friend and he's 23. The other one is a friend who started doing this with us a few years back and he's 28. Other friends come in and out for certain movies, mainly Die Hard.   Absolutely. I think it's thankfully gained a lot of kitsch value over the years, probably from people my age who grew up with it.  	7
 Just wondering.    Titanic    The Killers   Of Monsters and Men      I'm thinking like 300 or Immortals, what are some other ones?    And Titanic    Why does Luke run into Vadar when he's training with Yoda and see himself in the mask?   Can you imagine watching Gravity up there? It'd be so scary I imagine especially when Sandra Bullocks floating through space in all those scenes.    Chris Evans    Just wondering.       Just wondering.    Saw, when he stands up and the music is going crazy.    Do we like that? I think the raptors should be untrustworthy like in Jurassic Park because they're the intelligent predators. Thoughts?    Saw       "I'm the king of the world!"   Ya that ones my least favorite after seeing this one.    The whole Batman trilogy is great.       Help   Lol   I dunno they don't say things very blatantly, maybe it's something you have to watch a couple times.    I didn't mean to lol at the horrific setting of the movie.    So he's given a group of people a job to do, but this is taking place during the holocaust? Was it Jewish people that were kicked out of their homes and relocated?    No I know it's not funny I'm just disconnected a little because I'm not sure where it's going but I'll keep watching   	27
 Even curses follow the law nowadays.   wow, does he hotkey all his hatches seperate or what inject method does he use?    star conflict! It is kinda a thrid person shooter in space with space ships, always dreamed about a game like this when I was a kid. and now it's free to play on steam!   im a bit late to the party, but its because the working of the neurons in your eye, they are wired in suchs a way that you percieve more contrast than there actually is. its a bit of a long story, will edit later with a link when im not on my phone. very interesting topic of neuroscience!   Rain had that, totally screwed it up. He played so well for the first half.. but oh man what a game, nerdchills!   these hype video's really do get better and better. looking forward to another weekend full of ESPORTS!   This! Hitting a perfect drift while singing/shouting along with this chorus was one of the best things about this game.   I actually saw them live at sziget festival about 2 years ago. Oh man, that tent went wild when they played this song!   I live in Amsterdam and I always listen to this song while riding my bike on the way home in the night. The mixture of the relaxation of an sleeping, beautifull city and the atmosphere this song creates gives me the chills every single time. And when it finally kicks in, oh boy im racing on that bike.   Wow, thats really good! Thanks for sharing.   Crazy how GuMiho came back after beeing down to like 9 scv's to 25 drones at one point, almost a little sad he didnt pull it off!   As a dutchie I think i would really miss hagelslag.   the problem is that a quarter of the stalled bikes in the big cities in the Netherlands will never be picked up again..    I normally get 4 in early-midgame PvT, cutting that bio in half on ramps an chokepoints in awesome, later often only 2 because i wont use them anyway. (only pop GS before storming and so on) in PvP most of the time 2, mostly for GS as well in every fight. In PvZ i get about 4-8, dependig on my own and mostly the strat of my opponent. But the best thing about sentries is: scout every 1.5 - 2 mins for bases, tech changes, army comp and so on with hallu phoenix, in every matchup!   Yep this seems to do the trick for me too almost always. No need to restart the client! still very annoying though..   Such confident play by Grubby! he just really outplayed MC, im pleasently surprised.   The landscape in the netherlands is indeed quite boring, but if you visit the south of Limburg (where i grew up) you'll be surprised by the hills and creeks etc. Still nothing like the grand canyon though.  	17
 No. It's how dumbasses fight.    That can really be said for anyone, whether they cheated previously or not.   If any of you guys have looked at the new covers for the ebooks, a lot of the characters look much, much better.    Can you romance Aria T'Loak?    I am at this exact point and looking for confirmation on this. Also, if you romanced Ashley in ME1 and Miranda in ME2, is it still possible to romance Liara?    I think I need a cigarette after that   Didn't see it and figured reddit would tell me if link was already posted.       I am not telling you do anything, and I definitely do not agree with incorporating any personal beliefs or opinions into education/politics. What I am saying is that I accept the fact that people have different beliefs than I do, and I don't belittle them for it.   Personally I think it is ridiculous that so many people allow their own personal beliefs to influence their decision making in regards to politics/policymaking. The fact that people like Rick Santorum can potentially become the President of the United States of America shows that we are still a long way away from achieving that kind of separation of not only church and state, but personal/moral beliefs and state.    uh huh, tell me more about how I'm trying to govern people's private lives using a 2000 year old book with no scientific support as my guidelines. fuck you.  Never said you were. I said that you only think what you believe as correct and allow no room for anyone else's beliefs/opinions. Just because you choose not to believe in an idea that has no scientific backing to prove it does not make it ridiculous. That is what the main problem of this video is. Atheism is no longer just denying the existence of a supernatural creator, it's about throwing it in everyone else's face and telling them to "fuck off" if they don't agree.    Mark Meer is badass.    I would have to say this is a pretty narcissistic point of view. Just because you don't hold the same beliefs as another it suddenly becomes inferior and not deserving of respect. That puts you on the same level as idiots like Rick Santorum.    http://eurogyro.net/locations.html  444 East Exchange Street, Akron, OH 44304   In all reality it is just another person mocking the beliefs of others. Nothing new here. When are people going to just respect others beliefs and be done with it?   Next on my list after I finish The Wheel of Time then :)    Now I am interested, but I get the feeling that a large part of this series was spoiled for me.    but not the one this city needs.    I need 1920x1200 :(  Thanks though.    Can anyone get a 1920x1200 version? The only one I see is the one from bioware that has the banners.    What this tells me, is that a Mass Effect movie would be amazing. Here's to hoping that there is enough positive feedback from ME3 to prompt more discussion on this.    Mine would be that I love to cook/bake, and I like to keep my kitchen looking nice. Just picked up a new set of Pfaltzgraff dishes and I plan on picking up the matching set pieces when I get a few more bucks.    at 1:23 I was like, "....WTF?"      I am probably the one of the only people who disagrees with this. Definitely a very good story for the second game in a trilogy.    Especially the last few seconds of video in this trailer.    Aside from some of the others I have already seen posted here, I would really like to be able to re-experience Grandia 2 again. One of my favorite games of all times. Also, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West.    Good pick. I put down the second game after about 2 hours of playing, but the first still ranks as one of my favorite games.    I laughed pretty hard at this...   As did I. Seriously, I was thinking, "28 comments...nobody could have thought about Dead Island yet."   The Wheel of Time (series) is every bit as good in my opinion. On book number 4 right now and can't stop reading.   Please tell me there is a 1900x1200 res around here somewhere...    Drinking and driving   Not an insult, just stating a point. Also in your previous post you neglected to mention that his affiliation with the Tea Party had anything to do with your not respecting him. Also, even if he is a member of the Tea Party, that doesn't make him any less of a person. I can understand your sentiment if he was one of the crazies in the crowd holding up signs calling Obama a Muslim, but nothing you have said here seems to indicate that.    Looks like you are the one being judgmental, not him.    I agree with this 100%. Your first few bullets almost never seem to make contact although you are aiming right at the guy! I have a 30Mb connection with a 15ms ping and I consistently run into these problems in MW3.    Is this only on PC version, or can you see this on Xbox as well?   This guy said he liked Twilight Princess's controls better. His major gripe about the game has just been invalidated.    I agree. Sometimes it takes a good minute before a care package even comes out and by that time the round might be over.    I actually think this is good, because it will force IW to get a patch out reasonably quick due to the amount of people who will most likely have this problem. Hopefully they will take care of some other things along with this.    I don't know why you are getting downvoted. Even though the OP made a mistake I think this is what he was getting at.    Bog! Anyone?   **Gun:**  G36C (Red Dot Sight) .44 Magnum  **Perks:**  Scavenger Pro Assassin Pro Steady Aim Pro   **Killstreaks:** Support SAM Turret Advanced UAV Escort Airdrop  Sometimes I use Dead Silence instead of Steady Aim and I use Hardline in place of Assassin when running an Assault package.    Am I the only one that thinkgs the UM is a lot less OW than from MW2?   Haters gunna hate. This place is like /r/gaminghipsters.   Normally I would say so, but after maxing out the UMP it still isn't quite like the MW2 version IMO. No big deal, just takes some getting used to.   	45
 Lemme guess, Australian?   Please tell me what you did to get this infection, so I know never ever ever to do that thing   Ow.   Vomiting up an empty stomach just compounds the misery. That does sound brutal   I suppose it would be better to just get a bop on the head when you break a bone and wake up when the morphine has kicked in.   A girl I know fractured her ankle playing netball and was crying and vomiting with pain. It took 2 cute paramedics and a morphine whistle to get any kind of calm about her.   I hope never to break a bone.   I haven't even broken a bone or had a baby yet, so I have a feeling I don't actually know what real pain is   Like we have with the show. It'll be fun to come here and talk about what happens in each chapter. Maybe it'll keep me from smashing the book in 2 days and missing all the tidbits.   Heh radical   I don't expect it to last...and when they can do break up again I just have to bite back my "I told you so" and be sympathetic again      To give people the feeling that they are doing something by doing nothing   I am so happy there are people like you to help lazy people like me   My husband likes to fondly call me Cunt Rocket.  And when he is asking me if I want to get some drinks, he asks me if I am getting on the cunt tonight.  Our relationship is weird   I admit, it wasn't continuous work...I had a few breaks but yeah, it is just part of my work.   I am a Transplant Scientist. We do the workups for Cadaveric Organ Donors and like last night, we can often have 2 donors in one night (a single donor takes about 7 hours). I was On Call and that means I work my normal 8 hours and then if any donors come that night, I do them too.   So I left for work at 6:45am on Wed and got home at 8 this morning...and slept til 4.      I am not a boating person, but who doesn't have their anchor attached at all times?   http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/File:You're_not_-_A_Genius_001.JPG   Gabba   Thanks. He is a snuggle pie. Definitely takes advantage of warm laps and half-finished blankets :)      This is what I was picturing:  http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/36bnvu/z/creji47   This was what struck me first. With all the quiet, mysterious dignity the priests of the many-faced god possess, I am sure it would come crashing down each time they have to wrangle out the big ladder. I just imagine them yelling at eachother, trying to coordinate a big pole with a hook on it which they use to get the faces at the tippy-top.  "No Hank! The other old lady! The one with the big-ass mole."  "I can't bloody see the mole Bill, it's dark as shit up here!"   I did say something to some kids the other day, and so did another lady.   As expected, it didn't do shit   Ha ha, yeah maybe a little wait   He'll probably return with a handmade jumper :D   Yes! Look at those cold lifeless eyes!   Now I am just imagining a Machamp with a Magikarp's face   Just calling 'em like I sees 'em. I'm sure you have many other redeeming qualities...burliness, for example.  Just don't come to Australia though...it is actually illegal here for a fisherman to catch a carp and release it again. They are supposed to kill them on site    This works because carp are [ugly mofos](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Carpe_miroir_de_17kg.jpg)   In Melbourne it is free, and you are allowed to park on the footpath as long as it isn't blocking the way   One can only hope that anything we make lasts long enough to be loved to death   Buried under handmade blankets. Send help.   And by help I mean a cup of tea and maybe a muffin.   Ringwood East. Across the road from the train station :)   This place is literally around the corner from my house. It's dangerous. Although this time I was able to resist because I had already spent my money on a fabulous sequined jumper from the 80's   Nothing but patterns, baskets of yarn, doilies, throws, lace, fabric...      Yeah I was going to delete it but I decided not to let it bother me that much   Turns out that any image posted anonymously can't be edited :(   Thanks but I think being on my mobile makes it not work for me :/ Oh well, I'll just stay on this sinking ship I guess   Can I? Great. Maybe then people will lay off.  Edit: I have no idea how :(   No idea. I assumed he could do it when he reposted. It is exactly the same as his title, so maybe it just does that? I honestly did not write it   Mine too. Mind you, in most cases my car could barely achieve 1km over the speed limit.   *sigh* yes. He clearly did it to draw people to my post and start berating me...which is exactly what happened.  If you feel the need to go on about hypocrisy I suggest you go to his repost and tell him all about it. https://www.reddit.com/r/melbournecirclejerk/comments/368zpu/spotted_another_privileged_bourgeois_child/  I do not feel that I have been hypocritical in my comments   It is my picture. This is my original post. Sixteen_kebabs reposted   OMG. Ok let me explain this clearly.  I took the picture. I posted it to r/melbourne. U/sixteen_kebabs reposted my pic with that caption in r/melbournecirclejerk.  SO...when you criticize the "person who took the picture" you are criticizing me...when I have made no mention of having an iPhone   That's not my caption! sixteen_kebabs reposted my picture with that caption   Save room for your door   If you have been linked here from /r/melbournecirclejerk know this: I DID NOT WRITE THAT CAPTION!   Oh, I see. Someone from /r/Melbournecirclejerk has linked you here.  I DID NOT write that caption!   Can I clarify that I never initially meant this to be about the bank account of the car owner. As my title suggests, I was merely referring to the *power* of the car and expressing my feeling that a Learner probably shouldn't be at the wheel of something with so much oompf.  I am perfectly aware that rich kids need to learn and their parents' car is usually the most available car. I am not specifically attacking the wealthy. If this were a turbo skyline or a massive V8 I would have the same qualms. I feel that driving a car with power should come later in life, not when you are still learning.  I am not sure where this "exploiting labour'' comment came from either. I never once wrote that     I don't understand where that quote is coming from...I never wrote that   Where does the original person claim to be using an iPhone and where does it say that they were complaining about using the exploits of labour? Are we reading the same comments?  I did take the pic...with my Galaxy S5. I was merely trying to point out that a Learner driver probably shouldn't be driving such a powerful car. I wasn't trying to make this about people's wealth   Uhh no.  I have a Galaxy...which I paid for myself, and unless you are sitting in a cave Redditing via smoke signals, you can't say much about people using technology.  Edit: Pay attention to usernames people! The comment he referred to is not mine, hence my confusion   I wasn't meaning difficult   I don't buy drugs tho....   You not being in it would be a good start.   Says the person trying to convince me that I am wrong   Keep trying   For a person claiming not to be dumb you sure are making a good show of it   Yeah...I don't have a Daewoo. What a terrible attempt to be a wanker   I agree with you mostly. You can't automatically assume that an owner of a car with power is a bad driver, but putting a bad driver in a car with lots of power it a very bad idea. It usually makes a bad driver worse.    Well I am not sure if a Learner was actually behind the wheel of this one but it was roaring off and weaving through traffic like most idiots who own too much power. If it was a Learner he has bad habits already, and if it was the owner then he certainly doesn't seem like he will be teaching his child the proper road rules if he can't use them himself.   I was wondering that about Learners. Stupid rule   What kind of person trusts a 16 year old with that much power? That is a very fast way to lose your car and your Learners permit  Hijacking my top comment to point out that the title you all see is not my original title. I did not write it. Imgur automatically filled in the title after /u/sixteen_kebabs reposted my pic. For further info, see here  https://www.reddit.com/r/melbournecirclejerk/comments/368zpu/spotted_another_privileged_bourgeois_child/. So please stop accusing me of hypocrisy      **thinks      "Yeah, if you could get that camera out my face and let me nap, that'd be great."   No,  just hand done :)      I'm on mobile and it was a bit laggy. As the foil got flipped the video cut out and went black. Confused the shit out of me   I deliberately misread.   Context: I work at a Transplantation lab. On Call at my work involves coming in and crossmatching blood of a deceased donor with recipients. If I were to misread a result, the wrong recipient could recieve the wrong organ...and could die. If I were to do that deliberately it would be a one-way ticket out the door   I know right? I am just crossing my fingers that easy births run in the family   None taken. We scientists are a weird lot. Quite a few of us say "huzzah!" when things go well in the lab.    I haven't even got kids yet, and I am already looking forward to getting my tubes tied   I actually am. I kid you not   Yeah, great contribution there.   Man, what an absolutely stupid thing to get annoyed about   That ship has sailed unfortunately. She has her tubes tied and he has the snip.  No more bebbehs, even for science.  Which is a shame coz I am a scientist, so you know it would have been a quality experiment   Ignorance and conspiracy theories?  Little extreme for simply believing that this was advertising.  Unless you are being silly. In which case, ha?   That is a great looking tree.   When pregnant with her 3rd, my sister just woke up in the middle of the night and thought "hmm...I think I am in labour." Not wanting to push her luck because her 2nd only took 2 hours they bundled into the car and drove to the hospital (20min drive). She walked up to the counter and told the nurse she was in labour. The nurse, of course, saw no reason to hurry and actually told her to go home. My sister persisted, so they started to walk her down to the birthing suite. After 5 or so steps her waters broke and 7 minutes later my neice was born.  It all happened so quickly my BIL almost missed it. I can only hope I have it that easy when I have bebbehs   Where was that attitude when the Boltons were rustling her jimmies?   Hey, I was convinced it as Lion King too! It isn't hard to be nice while proving someone wrong, and if you are it'll just make them more open to changing their opinions   You just keep digging that angry little hole there champ   Who doesn't?   And, on the flipside, we have people who riddicule others because they don't recognise the works of some street artist.   Here we go. I think we can decide it is this Sunfigo character:  http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7605/16727638530_bf155543d2_m.jpg   I am going to be a little nicer about it and show you this picture:  http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7605/16727638530_bf155543d2_m.jpg  I just did some light sleuthing and it seems this Sunfigo guy uses this image a bit   Corner of Spencer and Batman   No, this one is on the corner of Batman and Spencer      I only just moved here 6months ago, so I am not familiar with everything this fine city has to offer.   We will be based in the Eastern suburbs and don't want to blow our life savings   Morphine is a cruel mistress.  My mum popped them like candy towards the end (Metastatic Ovarian cancer). One day, I think it was Mother's day, I gave her this cute little swan dish for her to keep her tablets in. Shit man, I just think that's messed up for an 8 year old to deal with...and I'm the one who dealt with it.  Glad you got to have at least that small something from her. It does help a bit    Touche   ...no   I meant, you were trying to somehow blame an unrelated occurance on "female privilege" and your name suggests you are a virgin. Maybe the two are related...   Thanks :)   Why?   She was 12   Croydon ringing in!  http://i.imgur.com/HOL0dY6.jpg   My mum passed in '99 when I was 9. She left my sister and I a letter, full of all her hopes and dreams for us and helpful advice. It was tough reading it, but it made me smile....except at the end.  It was never finished. It just cuts off after a little paragraph about how swearing is for dumb bunnies. She must have died before being able to finish it.  I'll never know what else she intended to say, but I try to live by her words as much as possible.  Except for the swearing thing. Curse words are the spice of life.   What you commented, in combo with your username, paints a very clear picture   I knew nothing about your original post, but I was instantly able to tell this was in Australia. Both from your clothes and that gorgeous view. Is that NSW?   Jokes on you, I sleep on an ensemble. You must be tiny   Take that back or I'll kill you!   I love this. Adult Finn is such a badass   Not really contributing to your point, but I just loved how Dany was "we gon get hitched. No arguments" and Hizzazz Kravitz just stared dumbly. I felt kinda bad for him, like maybe he already had a fiancee and Dany just shat all over their wedding plans   I understand that, but instead of validly calling out people on shitty behaviour, half the comments are just about women-hating.  /r/theredpill is even worse  I just think that things like these just purpetuate the problem. Maybe if men stopped claiming that women only did these things/got away with these things because they are women, instead of just assholes then these women might stop trying to use that as an excuse   Right? She is just back where she started, getting hitched to a lunatic...cept now she has some bitchin new threads   The hype of last season when she came down the stairs and said "shall we go?".   Last year everyone thought that was the start of her getting her littlefinger on   I just feel like she hasn't really achieved the level of sass and manipulation that I was expecting. She hasn't really done much at all except look aloof and cold.   I love sassy book Sansa, but cold show Sansa just doesn't do it for me.   My dad raised my sister and I from early teens after my mum passed.   One afternoon, a few days after he and I went out for lunch, an acquaintance of his came up to him and said "Who was that hot young thing you were with the other day?"  My dad said it took every ounce of my his self-control not to punch the guy as he told him "that was my daughter you sick fuck."  Single dads must cop it so bad   Subs like that are a jokes. What about just labelling all the people in there as horrible people....why do they have to be horrible *women*?  Plus, some of the vitriol spewing out of the subscribers sometimes makes me wonder if it is truly one sided.

I may be intelligent, but some days it is a goddamn miracle I make it through the day without walking into oncoming traffic. My husband isn't well-educated but he just *understands* the world so much more than I.  Combined, we are an unstoppable duo and our children will be geniuses.   ...or...y'know, have the IQ of wet sock   Yes but I can pick my dogs up by the scruff and put them outside if they annoy me.  Can't do that with kids   When I smile a really big smile, I show a lot of gum....and I hate it. I was always self-concious of it until I met my husband. He likes it. He likes that it means he has really made me laugh when he see my gums, and makes it his personal mission to make me "gummy-smile" as often as possible   I'm going to make the call here and say it was deliberate   This makes me so anxious. I want to have kids but I also really really don't want little monsters jumping on my exposed crotch   I am female and I have one of those alarms somewhere, but honestly if I heard one going off in my street I would probably ignore it, paying it off as a car alarm or some punk kids. I put zero faith on the thought of someone running to my rescue upon hearing it   I am so glad to see that I have seen almost none of these movies   My husband still wont let me forget taking him to see that one. He was not prepared   For some horrifying reason, I remember watching this as a kid   Hey, fuck you guy!

 Because this wasn't an OD in the sense you're talking about. If my doctor prescribed my a lethal dose of oxycodone then he probably would be charged with malpractice and maybe even negligent homicide. This however, happened because someone was selling adulterated pills. In all likelihood these people took what would have been a non-lethal dose of mdma but it ended up containing enough of the adulterant to kill them.         Front or back. Think of your head as a clock   Almost like nobody wants to do salvia, and if they do do it they never want to do it again   It's in late January.  I don't think so but my doctor has been considering getting me off them soon so maybe I'll wait until EDC to hang with molly   I've been digging Galantis lately, check out Runaway (U   I). So Young So High by Dada Life is pretty good too. Oooh and Colors by Tobu. That's all EDM but it doesn't have the insane bass drops.    So I've been taking welbutrin for a bit less than a year now -150mg XL (extended release?) and I'm planning on rolling for the first time at an upcoming festival. The interactions page on erowid cautions about how welbutrin can alter the effects of mdma but doesn't really go much more into it. Is there anything I should be worried about? I went through an extremely depressed phase for about four months before I started taking welbutrin and it helped immensely. I occasionally miss a dose but it doesn't cause any noticeable changes when it happens.   I think that's a pen or something like that   Looking for a place to take a buddy for his 20th   A lot of states eother already have or are adopting an 8.50ish minimum wage. Assuming 8.59hrs a day552 we get just under 20k. If they work six days a week we get 23k.    Honestly that's verging on lower than full time minimum wage pay in a lot of states so if you're salaried w/out commission at that then you're getting gypped to hell.   What about mephedrone?   I just went on the edc website to buy tickets for edc vegas 2015 and it says it tickets are unavailable. Is it sold out or what's the deal?   I read the same thing. Seems a bit ridiculous though.  Nicotine, caffeine, adderall, even exercise,  are going to more effective with much less risk.   Most people use "dab" rigs. Which can either be a their own smoking device or just a something that replaces the bowl piece on a bong. You'll heat up the concentrate with a torch lighter usually. Concentrates can also be vaped.   Im motivated as fuck right now so tomorrow I'm gonna get a fresh mile time   I haven't been able to do a full body pushup since middle school or maybe even elementary school and I just fucking did one! It's 1am and I started thinking to myself "You've gotten stronger and you've lost 40lbs, I bet you can do a pushup" and I got onto the floor in my boxers and fucking did one.   I know of all of those except for bordeaux (although after googling it I've found that it's the size of a small US city so that makes sense). I also could point them out so long as borders were drawn on the map because I actually paid attention in geography class.   Op is probably a nurse      Yes. As far as I know it's *only* legal for **certain** tribes to use in the process of a religious ceremony.    18 year old here. That's definitely not true.    So I bit off more than I could chew and decided to take a course without taking the skill advisory course beforehand. Couple that with an absolutely horrific professor and it being my first semester of college and I kind of fucked up. I'm at SBCC right now and trying to TAG UCSB and apply to Berkeley L S and UCLA. Can this course hurt my chances/void my TAG or am I good? It's not UC transferable.  I'm expecting a C or a D.   There aren't exactly many non-corporate cell phones nowadays and they've become somewhat of a necessity in this day and age.    I just don't get them. All of my friends talk about weird shit when they're stoned but even at an [8] I only really feel it in my body with the exception of being really happy.   Banging coke or shooting smack on a regular basis is much more dangerous than morbid obesity. Dabbling in shit like weed and MDMA and psychedelics is not.   No. It's not. Go to any college campus in the US and you can find an addy source in 10 minutes if you really look.    I know that dance safe sells mdma test kits maybe they have one for coke   Except for the two assholes that have the tips of their noses showing. They just look silly   It's for packing the bowl down as you're milking it   HOW DO YOU DO THAT ON YOUR LAPTOP [7]   And it's almost like you missed the *shred of normality* part   I wouldn't chill with someone if I found out they got a sexualized horse tatted on their bicep   You should though because it means that someone doesn't get to have thanksgiving with their family.   Alright, does devoid of friends with a shred of normality work for you? The moment summer comes around and she puts on a tank top they're gone.   What's gamergate?   I like to take a walk by myself to smoke a j before bed   Grand daddy purple   Like is there any way for an employer to find that information   Idk where you live but I go to a party school so here its nbd to say that you got high af over the weekend   I was four   not as bad as greenville...   He posted another picture of a guy "cleaning up after the riots" that was wearing the same letters. My guess is that this is some sort of guerrilla advertising for the Alpha Omega Theta frat   That have those! I saw a uh documentary about one...      Lorde makes me uneasy   Honestly I got a plain black leather wallet with an O pressed into it at the duck store for $20 and it's lasted through four years of daily use now   Nah op just needs to send him the key   So for the past two weeks, and occasionally throughout the past couple of months, what I've been doing is drinking water throughout the day and maybe having a power bar or something like that and then just eating dinner. I find that it's easier for me to not snack during the day when I can distract myself from my hunger than at night when I'm trying to go to bed. So I usually eat a 1000-1500 calorie dinner that can keep me stuffed. Will this adversely affect my weight loss or is it effectively the same as eating three 500 calorie meals a day without snacking?  I'm 18/M/5'9/210ish lbs.   Unfortunately (lol) I'm in socal   I want a cb300f so bad but I'm also hoping to get ABS. Kinda sucks that that's not an option for those   There's a bong I really want (A medicali slyme!) but it's $200 so I'm waiting in the hopes that grass city will have a cyber Monday sale.    After going on their locator and filtering to only include stores with gas stations I've found that there are five in Oregon, several in Washington, and several in every major city in california.    I haven't had the chance to ride one yet but I REALLY want the black and yellow model.   You can camp on most of the channel islands   IV reppin over here   Never seen one with a gas station out here on the west coast.   I've lived in California and Oregon and never seen one with a gas station   7-11 has gas stations?   I dont think they can ding you for being well hydrated. If you eat salty stuff it'll help keep your piss yellow   They're probably carrying some a glock of some sort. 15-22 rounds depending on what kind    you cant really speak on the matter because you've never been in combat. Everything I've read says that you sort of lose count when you go into flight or fight and just shoot. It also wouldn't take more than 10 seconds to shoot 14 rounds so it's not an obscenely high amount.   How do you like that medicali bubbler?   You're probably fine but I would drink a bunch of water until then just to be safe. Just carry a water bottle with you wherever you are and refill it whenever you can. Try to get clear piss haha   I've gotten the spins twice now and it's terrible. Don't know what causes it.   How are you inhaling? You need to draw the smoke and then open your mouth and inhale air. That should force the smoke that's in your mouth and throat into your lungs.   Thanks! 5'10      I did but they're always ripping tobacco out of that bong so I mightve got some left over stuff from the bottom of the bowl.   So I'm not a stoner by any means. I'm rather new to this whole world, but usually it takes me about two bong hits to get me decently stoned. Last night however I took a super small bong hit and things started out normal. After about 5 minutes though I started getting pretty dizzy and when I walked my legs tingled. After I came down 2ish hrs later I noticed that my hands were kind of shaky when I was playing 2048.   I've always described it as: an alternate timeline in which Robin and Ted had stayed together right from the get go   /u/666pool I got you. Consider yourself summoned.       They're down voting because people that care about what meme you use, unless it's just absolutely retardedly wrong, are annoying as fuck.    It was the reflection of the blue emergency lights   They're turned into "steak" sandwiches   I mean for most "major" weight losses you'll be left with loose skin. It can go away, especially if you're young and it's your first time losing and all that jazz but for a lot of people it doesn't go away unfortunately.    Isn't that a bit sketchy? I feel like if there are any complications it'd be better to be in the US.   Those girls are making pennies on every dollar that people drop in their rooms. I can't tell you how many times I've heard popular cam girls complaining about bills or talking about a day job. I sincerely doubt that there are more than a few camgirls making excessive amounts of money.    That's some CSI shit right there   I get what you're saying. I suffered through depression for most of my senior year of high school.  I honestly considered killing myself a couple times. I was lucky in that the first antidepressant i tried with my doctor worked. If you have access to modern medical care then I think that you should try every antidepressant available to you before you consider killing yourself. At the same time, I recognize that what I went through is no life worth living. If you've exhausted your options and can't get out of that depressive state then, and only then, do I think you should be given the opportunity to commit assisted suicide.    The people taking it are usually uneducated villagers from rural china that truly believe in old fashioned eastern medicine. They don't deserve to die because the chinese gov't is doing a poor job at educating them about modern medical techniques and dispelling the myths of ancient medicine.    So why can't the federal rulings on gay marriage that have been happening be applied universally to overturn all gay marriage bans?   Definitely not. Kinda looks like she has an EDM/rave type outfit on.   No it moves like a handheld camera   I honestly didn't even think about it. The first time I ever smoked weed there was tobacco in the bowl for the third hit I took but I didn't rip a full bowl. The people I was with would take a hit and give me the bong to clear the rest. This time was only my third time smoking weed and I figured that it wouldn't be too different but it just completely fucked me up. My friend says I took way too big of a hit. I milked it all the way up the bong before pulling the bowl. I still feel a bit anxious and my tounge still feels weird but I'm doing better. I skipped my classes for the day to recover.   No I don't think he did. I'm just concerned because I still feel off and it's been almost 17 hours. I feel slightly dizzy and lightheaded   Oh I know the weed wasn't laced as I've smoked from that batch before. I was worried because i didn't pack my own bowl. It was packed by a friend's friend that does molly and adderall and he got the tobacco out of a sack he has pinned to the wall.   Well the recreational shops won't be open until July but you can probably ask around more openly for some weed now   Yeah it sucked. I'm still feeling kind of anxious and my tounge still wants to be on the roof of my mouth but otherwise I'm feeling better. I felt terrible yesterday tho. It was bad enough that I honestly thought that it had been spiked with something else for a bit.   It wasn't my very first time. I've had cugs a few times before. Usually they give me a headrush and I'm good. I live in a dorm so I was over at a friends place a few doors down when they offered to make me a chop. I still feel off and a bit nauseous and nervous today   Oh shit I just woke up after falling asleep maybe 30 min after I posted this. Hopefully I can elaborate a bit better now and you guys can maybe tell if this is a normal reaction. So I took a hit of a bowl loaded with weed and tobacco. Almost immediately I felt like I was going to throw up. I managed to walk back to my room and then the room started spinning. My whole body felt super tickly and numb. I also couldn't stop putting my tounge to the roof of my mouth and my teeth were clenched and it felt like I had stomach acid on the back of my throat.

It's still happening. Clenching teeth. Tounge feels hot. Body tingling. Room spinning   It's worse. I cant control my tounge      I do care about quality. I don't have $400 to spend on glass though.    A sad attempt at less than a quarter of the price. Not everyone can drop hundreds on glass.   I'm looking at this one. Also is grass city discreet with their packaging? It'd have to go through the dorm mail system and my roommate might end up accepting the package and he's antiweed.  http://www.grasscity.com/int_en/blaze-glass-jet-flash-julia-7mm-glass-beaker-base-tube.html   I wish my hair was stupid thick. It's too thin for a solid draper look.     Santa Barbara county is voting to put their inactive desalination plant on standby.    I don't blame them.

Listen to ladies man magoo over here, talkin' about ladies n' stuff.   Box is balanced precariously on the vertical stick. Cat touches the horizontal stick which is tied to the vertical and it knocks the box off balance.    maybe one of the fucks down voting me could explain why?  Because it's not a blanket term. You wouldn't say that nigger is a derogatory term for white people would you? It's like a worse way of calling a woman a bitch. Yes, we call men bitches too but the meaning and offensiveness is different when directed at a woman.    It's the fact that he used it in a professional context that makes it bad. Especially because I assume that OP is American and it's a rather derogatory term for women here. The punishmwnt is retarded tho.   But he plead for no jail time so everything you just said is irrelevant.    I went to 4j schools from K-12 and I liked them. Graduated from south this past june.   The other one.....   You're 20?

I have not weighed myself because i don't know where to find a scale around here. I'm not sure what point you're trying to make with your response.    What about 8:18   I think they changed the rule a month or two ago. It was initially implemented to stop people from linking askreddit comments but i guess they decided to undo the blanket ban.   Honestly i have some doubts about whether snowden would be wanted if he had just exposed prism. It's the fact he exposed information about international surveillance and basically anything unrelated to prism that makes me dislime him   I haven't been in eug for a few months but I think I remember her being a shorter lady. Possibly with a hunchback.    So last night around ~10 I went out with a friend and we smoked with some people using a bong. I hit it twice with just a bit of smoke left in it and it didn't do much and then the third time I took a pretty big hit that gave me a nice body high and a bit of a head high. About 45 minutes later I went home and crashed super hard. It felt like I got an amazing nights sleep and woke up well rested but all of today I was really tired and spacey and I almost fell asleep in my business class. I got home and napped for like four hours. Was that from the weed or did I just not get as much sleep as I thought I did?   Or if the cop had been a state trooper and not a deputy then this guy would've been in the wrong.     I read the whole thing. He could be wrong depending on the officer or if deputies are granted state trooper privileges.    **Traffic control vehicles of the Washington state patrol may be exempted from the requirements** of subsection (2) of this section at the discretion of the chief of the Washington state patrol.  http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.08.065   The camera guy was "that guy" in high school. He seems like an asshole.    Fun fact it stands for original poster   Portugal is easier though because their borders are tiny as fuck. It's much harder to smuggle drugs in.   Did those wheels come with it?    any update?   I'm thinking of building my own bike. I want it to be really lightweight, where's a good place to look for frames and all that stuff?   Yeah I guess I'll probably get the kilo. A shop around here carries Fuji's. How would the declaration or feather stack up to the TT?   In my dorm building atm but I'll be moving out soon. My bigger concern is weekends and work because I usually lock up off campus.   I know that the components aren't of the highest quality but bike theft is a huge problem where I live and I'm not sure that a nicer bike would last. I'm currently riding a Retrospec B SS and loving it! It really got me into cycling and I think I want to pick up a second bike. Enter the attack. Currently I think that I'm riding 10-20 miles a week, 30-40 if I really get going. I'm trying to ride more though so I'm trying to eventually do 10 a day for exercise plus whatever I do when I'm commuting.  http://www.vilanobikes.com/vilano-attack-fixed-gear-bike-track-bike.html         I absolutely love the single speed bike I got about a month and a half or so ago. I've been commuting on it and riding maybe 20ish miles a week. 50 if I'm really going strong. I was considering buying a motorcycle but I think I might want to invest in a higher end road bike for commuting and fitness. Any recommendations? I'd like to spend no more than $1,000. I like the simplicity of the SS but I realize that upgrading to a geared bike might be worth it for when i start doing longer rides.   Look for something in the description of the bike that says "flip flop hub." That allows you to flip the back wheel and make it a SS. I got [this bike](http://www.retrospecbicycles.com/b-series-fixie.html) about a month ago from a shop in my town and I absolutely love it. It's simple and lightweight. My only complaint is that it's terrible at absorbing bumps.      Amish religion bans music   I've been trying to lose weight and I picked up a SS for college a few weeks ago and I've literally never had so much fun exercising.     But wait, isn't the federal government in the US currently trying to claim that encryption is something that only people with something to hide would use?  No. The circlejerk blinded people so much that they couldn't actually read past the title of that story. What he was actually saying is that since encryption can be used as a weapon, companies selling encryption software need to start making a good faith effort to confirm that the person buying the encryption software lives inside the United States.    Eugene is hardly the middle of nowhere though.    Germany sounds shitty   That's what I linked bro   I'm sure it says somewhere on the website. Don't these local vendors have some sort of bulk discount?       Because they're on the reliable vendors list in the FAQs. Is the slam dunk vendor sunmodalert? That's my second choice although after researching sun pharmas and looking at their site I'm leaning that way   My roommates and I share a mailbox and all mail gets processed through the university mail system. Too many potentially risky variables.    It would really ease my mind if I knew that a legit operation was running this website   I just got it and didn't need a phone number   So Coinbase seemed like my best option but I don't really want to link my bank account to buy the BTC (about $60 usd worth). I really just want to buy the BTC with my debit card. Can I do that with coinbase by purchasing the BTC from another source? Sorry I'm really new to all of this.  	165
 They're spinning off PayPal so when it tanks after Apple, Google and Facebook replace it, they can contain the losses and keep eBay afloat. Source: Brain   Rot in hell, Comcast.   2 Bush presidents with a third on the way.   Sara Palin said the same thing about climate change.   People pay money and wait in earnest to see Chris Brown? That's a reap what you sow lesson.   And US. Don't forget those concentration ca- I mean "reservations".   They were at their peak anyway.         Are you implying concepts like income equality are not feasible? I'd be interested to know your sources on that, because there have been numerous examples throughout history of economic equilibrium.  Converse to your critique, history shows that when the income gap widens to publicly perceived "insurmountable" levels, as we saw in Greece for example, the top heavy system tends to collapse on itself and leads to economic turmoil for all. As bank systems can be deemed so big that they can plunge the world into grief should they fail, the economic ramifications of having a massive gap between the haves and the have-nots can theoretically result in much more catastrophic market consequences. Some of these I would wager we are beginning to see currently in the US in the form of widening state financial deficits coupled with coagulation of corporate holdings. In short, as the rich get richer and practically eliminate taxes, the poor grow poorer as the infrastructure that supports and more importantly employs the lower classes begins to fail.  Again, I'd love to see your source for the disparaging remarks against income equalization because I don't believe they are rooted in any formal education on the issue at all.       Watching Republicans juggle pushing for less government oversight of banks while pushing for more oversight of DC residents and their rights during a Presidential election cycle is going to be fascinating. "The government shouldn't meddle in our lives. Except pregnant women. But that's it. And marriage, ok just those two. And birth control rules for companies. But seriously those three aside...no, marijuana too. Ok those four things aside, we want government out of people's lives."               You overeat and say you ran a 7:20 mile...tell me more about your not understanding this question.   Do you have to understand the point of something to acknowledge it exists?   Are you seriously implying you don't know people are hypocritical?   4chan.      I thought that's what it read, thank you!      Soundgarden - Ty Cobb. Great track, has what IO believe to be a banjo breakdown in it.   Great parenting all around.      I've been drunk before. I have been "Wow, I can't believe I called my ex" drunk. Been "I can't believe I didn't die from my own vomit" drunk. I have NEVER been "That amputation was a breeze" drunk.   I'm going with the discovery of anesthesia. I honestly cannot imagine how much life sucked before that.      I'd like to think the hype is only helping Reznor secure all permissions and funding to make this release as absolutely perfect as possible. I know from multiple interviews he seems baffled by the surge in interest, but I know he also is hearing people who are begging for it. Looks like people tweet about it regularly too. It's one of my top three favorite albums and I am going to be patient, because when it comes out I know it's going to blow me the fuck away just like it did the night it came out.  Tl;dr - this is going to be worth the wait   Russia blamed? WTF? Weeks ago the Wall Street Journal and Reuters were gloating that the crash in oil was going to destroy Russia. People can't even rage consistently anymore. It's insane.   I'm guessing you haven't been anywhere near it in decades. Even condos in North West are selling for 400k. The worst ghettos of DC are still getting 200k for the rowhomes.          The fact that it is increasingly less fantastic with every read makes it one of the scariest books ever written in my opinion. Every day, it becomes a little less unlikely.    Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace by Gore Vidal, read it just out of college and it caused me to reconsider a lot of positions I had taken for granted. For better or worse, it changed my outlook on a lot of things to this day. I'd love to hear about other books impacting others in similar ways.   Looking for a book that affected you long after you finished reading. Something that made you consider or reconsider your position on a subject, your attitude, your lifestyle, your job, your relationship, your habits etc.   Antiviral, 13 Sins, Gone Girl, Would You Rather, The Hole,  Cry Wolf are a few that come to mind.   I already forgot she ever existed.   In line at Wal Mart?   It's not as bad as it sounds, just make sure you're really drunk. Trust me.   I think mine would involve paying for my Comcast services with a Comcast bank issued credit card that I make monthly payments on with income I make working in a Comcast owned grocery store that I drive to every day in my Comcast sponsored transport pod. On the way to work, I pass the Comcast Public Library, the Comcast Community High School and wave to my friend who is headed to work at the Comcast Water Department. On the radio, I only hear the "latest pop hits" Comcast plays on their menus and between each song I am exposed to 5 minutes of advertising for the lastest "hit reality show" Comcast will be showing that night.  Yes. That sounds like hell to me.      If he is singling out blacks as a group he won't help, it's bad. If he is implying everyone is suffering in the same way and he won't extend customized solutions to specific groups of people, that's actually worse.  How out of touch can a person be to believe everyone in the US are facing the same issues? If he's racist, that's one thing. If he's so clueless he thinks every problem in the US is shared because we're all Americans, that's just insane.      I think I missed something...did this comment actually address what he said, or was it sort of a generic statement thrown out to change the topic in lieu of an actual response? Just want to make sure I didn't miss some credible explanation for this.      Somewhere, someone who doubts North Korea carried out the Sony hack upvoted this link...      I'm starting to believe he really has a mental handicap of some sort. He honestly thinks he is somehow supposed to be president because he wants it, and it just does not compute to him that it isn't happening.          Where's the money for church tax exemptions  and bank bailouts?   I love this headline so much. Thanks for making me laugh OP   I'd add diamonds to this. It's hard to believe people still pay so much for something worth, realistically, so little.   Nice restaurants. It's just dressing up something that winds up being flushed in the end.               You just keep having these same dreams at different times, or are they combined? That seems like a lot...   Reading Freud does no one any good.      ^^^   I'd love to see those stats. How many people use Netflix, Hulu, Prime, Crackle etc who were enrolled in cable television when they started, and how many dumped cable television within 30, 60 days of using those services. I feel like Comcast attempting to buy Time Warner is an admission  from them that the broadband cable is their last possible attempt at future profitability, because television is dying. And once Google fiber and other comparable services start rolling out en masse, I think Comcast is going to start breaking off pieces of their company and spinning them off to avoid complete bankruptcy. I cannot wait.      Couldn't agree more.          As people in Kansas are trained to be ignorant. Isn't it amazing how effective training can be?    Uneducated people can't be unhappy? I'm sure you aren't smiling all the time, right?   Water is wet...?   That is a completely different discussion. They aren't even educating their children to the fact fossils are real. There are some basic steps that need to be taken before they can learn how the legislative system works, don't you think?   What part of Kansas are you from? The part of Kansas I hear from want him out. The locals call it 'Brownbackistan'. There's even a running joke he keeps everyone out of work so they can't afford the gas to run him out of the state. So overall, I'll give you a 4.5 for form, but your substance was lacking a bit in truthiness.         Is there anything you could have done that may have changed the outcome?             The problem with that comment: Headline still true      Every radio station. All of them.      Pretty sure it impacts the majority of the world.   Celebrity worship.      http://strictlycomedancing.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Victoria-Pendleton-Brendon-Cole-Strictly-Come-Dancing-Series-10-2012-4x600.jpg      It's visible from....cyberspace. Bam.   My wife is from Eastern Europe and she REFUSES to teach me insults or swear words. One day, she got really irritated in traffic and spouted something that as far as I can tell roughly translated to something about a mother servicing a farm animal. I would love to know if other such insults existed in the world, I have to drive on the beltway and could always use some suggestions.         Thanks, appreciate it.       Spend a lot of time thinking of incest, do you?   Much like the endless row of gentlemen outside of my moms bedroom, I walked into that.   This question brought to you by Die Hard - a film series I've never seen and am now being relentlessly taunted by two close friends for never having seen.  My schedule and Die Hards schedule just never lined up.   Any particular reason you haven't done that thing?   I've never watched a Die Hard movie and likely never will. Am I going to hell?   So...patients hooked up to vents in hospitals, you're on your own. This is America. *lights out*      Yes :)   It's sad people who have known me my entire life can't get even close to this level of awesomeness in the gifts they get for me.      Not sure, but I'll try to find out or direct him here.   Odd, they scare me. Then again, I live in Baltimore.   In a manner of speaking, yes oddly enough      http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/08/06/is-the-peak-oil-myth-dead.aspx  There are some sources that argue that way of thinking. Personally, I think if people (including me) were manipulated into accepting higher prices once due to a false belief in a shortage crisis, there is every reason to believe they (and you) are being manipulated again.     The extraordinarily high price per barrel is a fairly new phenomenon. Viewed as statistics over decades, isn't the latest drop representative of normalization?

    Pretty sure Calvin Candie already discussed this.    Bad call ref, what are you blind.       I've wanted Asian cuisine all day so I walked down a few blocks to get some. I didn't read the sign before I entered into the Mexican restaurant right next to it. I felt too awkward to just leave so now I'm eating food I can't pronounce.

 "The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism" by Emmanuel Goldstein...the book that Winston Smith is reading in Orwell's "Nineteen Eighty-Four".   "The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another."   These women need to quit. They must be the worst bounty hunters in America.   Escalate, escalate, escalate!   Approach, approach, approach!    Have to agree. After Dead Man, which I thought was a masterpiece, I was really hoping Ghost Dog would be better, and it left me feeling a little cold. I liked it, but didn't think it was up to Jarmusch's standards. And you're right, Limits of Control was basically unwatchable.    Another film to check out would be Branded To Kill. Branded To Kill, Le Samourai and Ghost Dog all have essentially the same plot: a hitman is given a job, a woman is left alive as a witness and as a result, his bosses decide to take out the hitman leading to a showdown.   This specific technique was discussed by the Nazis at Wannsee:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPIctGbAZEQ t=41m11s     Surprised nobody has mentioned The Stone Roses.

Edit: Reddit's sarcasm meter is broken again.        Let me guess, there will be rivers of blood any day now right? How long before the black man has the whip hand over the white man??? You're using the term segregation incorrectly. Segregation is imposed by one group over another. This is voluntary because of mass immigrant populations creating their own communities. Good for them.    First of all fuck the Daily Mail.  Second of all, there are approximately [24,372](http://www.education.gov.uk/popularquestions/a005553/how-many-schools-are-there-in-england?) schools in England, which means that 0.34% of schools currently have no British pupils.

Yeah, it really is an overlooked gem!    Midnight Run. The trailer is utter crap, but if you've seen it, you know it's one of the best American movies of the 80s. A genre action/comedy, it's really worth checking out....despite the trailer:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1_N28DA3gY    Once Upon A Time in the West.    I love that bit.

Oh come on, reddit is just a bunch of unprofessional nobodies shooting their mouths off, posting whatever flatters their own biases, engaging in petty infighting and cluttering up the world with a lot of timewasting nonsense...holy shit, it really is like the mainstream media.   Couldn't agree more. Specifically, there's no contest between the final battle scenes. The ending of Iron Man 2 was just spectacular. Plus Iron Man 2 had Sam Rockwell. Damn that dude is funny.    Yes. Especially since Molson isn't a Canadian company.    Totally. I thought it was better than the first one.    America: Guilty until proven innocent.       True. Hardly one of the worst movies ever made as is often claimed. Not a masterpiece, but it has a bunch of funny scenes.    Nikola Tesla, the man who invented the 20th century.    Listen again. I love the Stooges and the MC5...kind of ambivalent about the Dolls...but Death is doing something completely different.    Excellent choice. The whole album is great, but the closer is just stunning. I don't think anybody was making music like this in 1974. Bad Brains is still three years away!   He earned his dollar that week.    Waterloo Park! Because it's right downtown, you'd get spectators, the area is big enough. They play cricket there on Saturdays, but other than that it should be a good place.    Some more information on the end of marriage:  The National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia publishes an annual report titled The State Of Our Unions which includes data on US marriage rates since 1960. From 1970 through 2008, the US marriage rate has declined from 76.5 to 37.4 marriages per 1,000 unmarried women  see the chart below:  http://www.the-spearhead.com/2010/01/08/the-end-of-marriage-2/    Probably two shots to the head like Gary Webb.    The age of the story affects its relevance how? You mean to say all the corruption has gone away since then? I think it makes the point more relevant. What's the problem with the source? The New York Times not good enough for you? Maybe Chemical_Monkey's links will satisfy.    So, uh, it doesn't count? All the corruption is cleared up now? Well, maybe Chemical_Monkey's links will count.   Here, let me google that for you:  44 Officers Are Charged After Ohio Sting Operation  In what may be the largest and widest ranging police corruption investigation in the country in recent years, 44 officers from five law-enforcement agencies were charged today with taking money to protect cocaine trafficking operations in Cleveland and northern Ohio, Federal authorities said.  http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/22/us/44-officers-are-charged-after-ohio-sting-operation.html    So, does this mean the XBox 720 (or whatever it's going to be called) IS going to be backwards compatible?

Again, I think you're trying to have it both ways. The law is stupid and unjust, and the prosecution was politically motivated....but really there's no problem because it was all legal. It's this vacillation I object to. Again, that it was in keeping with the law doesn't work because it was selective prosecution, re: the other seed distributors. I think this was without any doubt a strictly political maneuver and neither justice nor the law was served.   And sorry, not be a dick, but you are being naive about the power structure behind the war on drugs. There are very, very powerful interests at work that have absolutely no interest in seeing marijuana decriminalized here and the economic repercussions would be so horrendous, no government could actually enact it up here. Being defeatist is acceptance of defeat without struggle. That's not what I'm advocating, the struggle should go on, but if you're not aware of just how powerful the anti-drug lobby is in the U.S. you're kidding yourself. I have to agree with David Simon, the U.S. drug war is a holocaust in slow-motion and if they're willing to live with that, what makes you think Canada is going to change their mind? We follow their lead because we have to.    It is possible for something to be both politically motivated and in the in best interests of justice.  Theoretically, but does that apply in this case? Hardly.   Wait a minute, you can't have it both ways. Are you trying to claim that it was both politically motivated AND the case was pursued in the interests of justice? That's absurd. The arrest and conviction of Emery has, of course, done absolutely nothing to halt the marijuana or marijuana seed trade in the U.S., it was strictly done for political purposes and you clearly know that. If not, why didn't the DEA go after the Vancouver Seed Bank or Kind Seed or Vancouver Island Seed Company or Liberty Seeds? Well, when they get big enough, they will because it's politically motivated. Some prosecutor will be looking for a feather in their cap.  But back to my original point, you originally claimed that "Canada is a sovereign nation, the US can't disallow us from doing anything." But that's kind of naive, don't you think? The U.S. drug apparatus, from money laundering banks like HSBC to the police to the lawyers to the judges to the private prisons all have way too much at stake and will not allow Canada to mess that up. Which is why we HAVEN'T decriminalized marijuana in the last thirty years. We keep talking about it, but until the U.S. changes its mind, which it might eventually, we will follow the American lead.   Wow. Never seen someone actually try to claim the Marc Emery case wasn't politically motivated. Not even the DEA Administrator who prosecuted the case:  "Today's DEA arrest of Marc Scott Emery, publisher of Cannabis Culture Magazine, and the founder of a marijuana legalization group -- is a significant blow not only to the marijuana trafficking trade in the U.S. and Canada, **but also to the marijuana legalization movement**."  Also, you're misunderstanding the case. He wasn't charged with any crimes in the U.S. all the alleged crimes occurred in Canada and police here never charged him with anything. This is about as clear a case as you can get of the U.S. drug policy trumping Canadian laws, whether you want to admit it or not.    Not defeatist at all, it's completely realistic. Look up the Marc Emery case to see how U.S. drug policy trumps our laws:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Emery#2005_arrest_and_extradition_proceedings    It's still illegal federally and federal law trumps state law. You're a long, long way from it being legalized and taxed in the U.S. or Canada, and if you don't think the U.S. has heavily influenced Canada's attitudes towards marijuana legalization for years, you're way underestimating the influence U.S. drug policy has up here.     Don't be too impressed. Wait until he's in a position to do something about it and reverses his position like everyone else. This is just pandering to the youth vote, the U.S. will never allow Canada to tax and legalize it.    Keep watching until after the credits for a brief documentary.    This is a great adaptation.

Desolation Row.       KANEDA!!!!!!!!!!   I see what you're saying but pretty much the same thing can be said about lots of technology that reaches the consumer stage. It's a commercial application of an industrial technology that, in order to have mass appeal, specializes and reduces the capabilities of that original design. The technology in an iPad is actually pretty old. We've had a device that can be programmed to carry out a set of operations with a CPU and memory to run applications for a long time. But the innovation of the application of that technology counts for something. You could say the same thing about the iMac and compare it to a CRAY or whatever, you know what I mean. But the fact that 3-D printers are "crappy" cnc mills that use "shitty" mitres that only cut plastic is actually really important and definitely could have a serious impact on the way we produce goods. 3-D printers are "cheap" cnc mills that use "cheap" miters that use one of the most common and versatile substances on the market. That's very handy and, I hope, going to be cool! They'll constantly work to reduce the waste and improve it, but I think it looks very promising. I'm going to make my driverless Google car look like the Batmobile or something. Hopefully I can just download the plans!    Exactly my first thought.

 I have PS4 and honestly I feel no lags whatsoever.   Ezio. Undoubtedly the most charismatic character in the series.   Connor  Arno  Edward  Altair   No one cares.       If there's one thing I always loved in Assassin's Creed and made me continue to buy all the games, is the environment. No matter what amount of games I play, nothing matched Assassin's Creed in that. I spent at least 50% of my time in Unity just walking around and  admiring each individual and building in Paris. Pretty much just like I did in AC2.     It's building the world, the characters, mapping out the plot. I can spend weeks planning everything down to the smallest detail. That's when my creativity blossoms. Once I've done that, I sit down and work.  I think my problem is that I'm still stuck in the 'building' part. You see, it's just so freaking fun I can't hold myself! Writing a long novel, section by section, chapter by chapter, seems almost drudging after that. Nonetheless, it's certainly much more rewarding.    Hello r/writing!  It's been a while since I posted something here so hopefully this wouldn't break any rules or guidelines.   So I've been writing for about two years now, and goddamn I enjoy every moment. I'm 17 years old and frankly I'd never imagine writing could be so exciting and rousing all together, nothing we did in school matched that (unfortunately so). Nonetheless before I carry on I must inform you that my English grammar is quite terrible, so if you're a keen lover of English, this tread may not suit you (I write my fiction in Hebrew, by the way). So since my first project last summer a few things happened:  * I wrote 62k words for Random Scenes, short scenes that are mostly unrelated to the plot itself. I write those whenever Im in some kind of sentimental mood. You know, seeing the countryside I pass by each day or hearing a good Jazz tune at a quiet evening. *  I wrote another 2k words for the history of the place my novel is set in (that includes politics, wars, feasts and so on). * I wrote 2k for the novel itself. The problem is, I presume, is that I get so inspired by short, everyday things and sadly that inspiration doesnt long enough for me to sit my ass down and write the storyline itself. In any case, I would like to hear the advice of writers who suffered from the same thing.   **TL; DR** I get hooked writing the backdrop of the novel other than the novel itself. Help?    Is she crying?    Should I sell Sony's stocks?   [I found it here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Colorization/comments/1wcmmh/susan_peters_worked_her_way_into_hollywood_after/)   I really liked Venice too.

I'd love to hear your preferences.    In the time period you choose the most interesting time period of all games. In the environment you choose the city (or if you prefer the oceans in Black Flag) that were most fascinated by.    Cities, oceans, forests etc.    Of course, my personal opinion:  1. AC2 2. AC2/ACB 3. AC2/AC3/ACU 4. AC2/ACU 5. Definitely AC2. Rogue and Liberation also sound quite well.

For those who played Assassin's Creed since the first (original) game, which game topped the others in terms of:  1. Plot. 2. Hero.  3. Time Period. 4. Environment.  5. Soundtrack.  That's pretty much all I can think of. If you have anything notable you've liked about a particular game, write it down as well. Hopefully this will give Ubisoft a better understanding of our views and opinions.   Is there anyone French here who's willing to do a heavenly work and translate a portion of Unity's street dialogues between civilians?  Unfortunately it's french and most of us don't speak it. ):  Update: There's no good video of it on YouTube, so I'll record the dialogues myself on the PS4. Should be ready within a few days.

I never liked Constantinople. The place and period together don't offer much excitement for an Assassin's Creed game. I mean, aren't there MUCH better time periods to focus on?    I play on PS4 and ever since I got this game I found myself just walking around the city, recording videoclips each 100 meters.  I used to think Ubisoft could never outrank Fireze and Venice, especially after seeing how they screwed up Revelations and Black Flag, but now... I'm beginning to think Ubisoft is finally returning to its golden age. Apart from the bugs of course.    I've always this weird fantasy that when the series will end, and the last assassin will raise and give his final monologue, this theme will play out in the background.   Geez, it gives me goosebumps already.   How much did you pay?   I've never tried that. I did find a bunch of ps4 savegames, so I suppose it's simply a matter of copying.    Or 90%. I've finished the game on 49%, and now I would like to try some of the cool outfits there are in the game. Could someone help, please?   	33

What are your thoughts on the legacy left by this man?         Yeah, wikipedia reads are difficult to convey emotion with so much objective info. I just released this [Creepypasta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djuwKGBI-IU) today if you're interested in a more narrative voice :)         He's so young, how does he have such a legacy so soon?      Thanks friend   Sorry I took it down. Decided to shut down the channel cuz lets plays actually just frustrated me :/. Pick up the game if you got some extra cash. It's sweet   Decent. Just working away at my job, of which I'm very blessed to have in this economy. Interestingly enough, the date I talked about didn't really pan out but led to meeting someone else who also loves Christ and seems to have a lot of interest in me. My only issue, and I believe it to be a superficial one includes that, though we get along fantastic, I don't feel very attracted to her physically and I don't know how important that is. There's also the fact of the matter of, why should I worry about a relationship at all? I am still currently back and forth with the sin of internet pornography which drives me crazy, so how could I be ready for a relationship? One good thing is, a friend of mine from work, has asked me to take him to Church recently, so we have been going. Prayer for him would be fantastic. His name is Charles. Other than that, I think I've come up with a tentative goal of moving to Hawaii in the next 5 years. Something about it seems to call me out there. But anyway, thank you for following up with me :D. I pray that you're doing well?   Reddit doesn't like state farm anymore. Keep up brosh         And the circlejerk continues. As if I didn't see his face enough in the news.  FOR THE KARMA!!!!!1   Yeah, clunky controls lead to a very poor overall game, but the hilarity of picking up an enemy while he hangs onto another's leg is a fantastic achievement.    Yesss can't wait   I'd say Euphoria animation used in games like GTA V and Max Payne 3 is pretty ground breaking. Oddly enough, it was only really utilized in Rockstar licensed games.   She's sittin on somethin funny lol   Dying Light looks substantially better than this rushed piece of next gen nonsense    Upvote the positive comments, downvote the negative ones? BOIL in your hive reddit.    He might be 8 like your girl...   let the negativity FLOWWWWwww   I agree with u   It's nice not to see something gay on reddit for once.   Not a software engineer, but I wanted to fit in with random internet dweebz.    I don't get it. We do realize that we support this bullshit? 3 billion dollars a year to israel to genocide people? Am I the only one who feels this way?   He kinda just threw himself into the house...   Ze Blacks can be razist too ya knowwwwWwwwwww   80% of male gamers don't have girlfriends. But that's OK. 100% of people don't need another human being to "complete" them.    Sounds like they're controlling it...   That Swedish sonofabitch is right! I can fit a whole cucumber up my bum!   VERTICAL VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!.... I kinda like it.   When they infect insects and control their actions until the release of their spores. That's terrifying to me and begs the question.    Looks amazing and satisfying. How do I support?   1000+ characters on screen. You are one of the them. You die? You're immediately placed into a currently spawned character (Most likely one with the least likely hood of combat or death). This goes on until all characters on one side are dead or the objective is completed. That's my two cents at least.       I do like Froyo   But who really wins?   Anti-Semite!  attack this man! He's believe what is right and not what is fed down his throat from fox and the like!    RUined!   Bichael May hehe   so much imagination in this one. love it.       Big Oil Tycoon. This checks out.    I mean. I don't why we just don't blow up all the big media stations and then all the poison won't be pumped out daily to our poor defenseless old people who still watch the news. If there's one thing my country has taught me, it's okay to use violence to get what I want.    gay      I always wondered if these stupid posts are actually from the company themselves just trying to project their bullshit to naive users. PAPA JOHNS!   Mutherfucking uncreative repost garbage   well, the owners of the media have a certain agenda they want to fulfill and message they want to give to the masses. It's highly unlikely that this would ever reach the mainstream media, as it wouldn't fit into the paradigm.     Great buzzword. The embarrassing part is your use of the phrase "anti-Semite" is far too commonly misused and implies racism through its usage. Unfortunately for you, this video is not discriminatory towards any particular group or sect of people - neither is the title. It simply demonstrates a dialogue between the President of Israel (Netanyahu) and his acquaintances, as He discusses his intentions corresponding to Palestinian relations. Through his actions during his presidency, and most predominantly during the past month, it is the leader of the Jewish state, Israel, that demonstrates a lack of tolerance towards a specific ethnic group (Palestinians) - and thus can be dubbed "Racist".      Why would Chris Matthews have to spoon feed you information for you to at least consider it?      Yay!...he spoke...   I don't get it      pROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST ENJOYABLE ASPECTS OF rEDDIT, GRAMMAR AND TOLERANCE   aND i HOPE THEY LET GRAMMAR NAZIS INTO hELL   i WILL BURY YOU 1   This makes me happy. There's nothing else in this brief vapor breath of a life we have here on Earth that will carry you through like the love of Jesus Christ. God bless you, brother and your family. May He be the rock of which you build your foundation upon.    It's thoughts on a book written approximately 2000 years ago, I think it's safe to say that its up to date based on the source material.    Fiasco!!!!   I want to diffuse the Hilary bomb before Reddit fills it with its circlejerky gun powder.   Oh Jesus NO Reddit, NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! We must destroy this circlejerk at its core!!!    Why doth the Hivemind love him so? Doth he seepeth honey?    aNYBODY REMEMBER WHEN THE SOVIETS KILLED 2 MILLION RUSSIANS? yEAH, ME NEITHER...      at least that's what I've noticed.   The AI in this game suck at driving   What is this? A subreddit for ants??   Hewtler   It seems my humor has gone in other directions since I was 12.   I really want to enter into a relationship. I think I have an opportunity to do so. I think. Yet, I still struggle pornography etc etc etc. I don't want to end up hurting someone or myself through a gross habit. I'm not really sure what to say beyond that. I have the desire to stop and succeed at times and other times, I fail. I wanna kick this before getting into something serious. Any words of advice would be great. Thank you.   Gearbox is hit or mizz   praise Jesus they're alright   Rats! I was working on an album just liek this! Beet me 2 it.   All 4 servers are full. poo   One day the desire just left?         WELL FUCK HIM!   I kinda feel like this is photoshopped...   looks like a girl   I heard we're gonna stay there forever. Until all the troops are dead.    Wowza, crazy people I tell ya. I've gotten little generic things from churches I've attended before and never have they seemed so self righteous like this before.    Ending your life will lead nowhere.  Losing your faith will lead nowhere.  Holding on to the hope that is given to you through Christ will lead you to eternal peace.   You just have to weigh your choices.   You want to live on the streets? (I don't say that to be rude). If so, keep me in mind down the road. I desire to assist.    PM me your paypal    What happened?   The definition of enlightenment can extend two directions. Your direction that you propose incorporates scientific progression and healthcare/augmentational advances. The other direction proposes that becoming enlightened involves understanding our inner-self, accepting that death is inevitable and living in peace through that knowledge. I do not foresee that the human race will be around for the many eons to come. There is also the consideration of whether or not the Creator will even allow this Universe to extend its existence longer than initially intended. Our existence is finite. But there is an infinite existence that we feel exists, and should strive to find, beyond our Earthly shell. This I feel is achievable through the understanding of Jesus Christ.    I know this is an over asked question, but I really need some input. Working 40 hrs a week and raising a family to repeat the cycle can't possibly be what God intends us for. I feel as if though I'm driven mad by the mindless pursuits the majority of the population seem to strive for. What are things that we, as Christians, should participate in to find true satisfaction in life? Even success feels like a failure here on Earth.    Why do I always have to venture to the comments to find something actually "funny"   I could either see this making it to the front page for looking "Trippy" or fail miserably because it's utterly pointless. Either way, I'm pissed.    she looks happy enough   not funny   I need the most idiot proof tutorial possible to figure out how to get the shader mods and/or texture packs. No idea what I'm doing.    I like that a lot better as one color. Whats it look like smaller on one line at the bottom? Maybe just a small symbol dividing the title - artist   http://www.sendingorbs.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/secede-tryshasla.jpeg  This cover art is an example where the art brings you in and the artist and title are an afterthought, though gets the job done.    You just need the title to compliment the cover art. If not compliment, make sure it doesn't clash with the cover art, which I feel it is doing now. Especially the blue and red. Take a look at other cover art text, they usually match the aesthetic and have a style of their very own. At the very least, the text should be so minimalistic  and out of the way that people will find the album title once they've been pleased by the cover art. This cover has much potential and can't afford to be brought down by poor text.     So pissed I pay 60$ for this on launch. Never again for a single player focused game.    This is of a large amount of goodness.   Being a U.S. citizen, I suppose I'll be the first to step forward to represent my country.... "Sorry bout' that".    Given to the most prestigious gay cats about town.   Kiss the ceiling fan!   You've seen maybe 5 minutes of gameplay. This game is a completely different game than CS:GO.....And will own it nUb!   Thank God! After Patriots was cancelled I was heartbroken. Those animations almost look too good to be true.   LOOKS FREAKIN' BEAUT   "PRE-ORDER NOW AND GET YOUR 13 YR OLD COCK SUCKED!"   Exactly   Someone watched South Park...   lul   You can never be too careful.          Let the "Redditors being offended" begin   Niggas gotta cross dress to make it big.    I miss my doberman so much so much   No, I'm done. If anything, it has taught me the importance of using sex as an expression of love, within marriage. The lust that I used it for gave it almost no meaning, and took away much, if not all the goodness from the experience. Let's pray for one another friend?   I gave up my virginity today. It's a strange feeling. I don't feel different. I still feel loved by God. But I know I made the wrong decision. Something I held onto for so many years, is now gone overnight. I don't really know how to react, and just need some words to help me make sense of it. My heart is open.       the kills look pretty satisfying. Something you don't get often from canned animation games like CoD and Battlefield.   Does anyone have any information about foods/diets/supplements, or life style changes that can prevent and/or reverse cancer cell growth?   That's awesome! What led you away from Mormonism if I might ask?      If you feel a conviction from God, follow it. Those who turn from Him, if they one day return, that is a joyous occasion for the Spirit. But since you seem to feel your faith swaying you, sway towards Christ.    we will unfreeze Walter Disney and begin our takeover   let the memes begin.  I'll start  "A Chevy Man"    save wolfenstein for a really good deal down the road.    someone should photoshop blood in this.   Wish they would've waited   WorldStarHipHop!   Too*   Get better at playing the game. If you kickass, you're obviously not in my way.    how do we get rid of them?   "On the same day as the peace demonstration"   this video is old as dirt.      Luke 15:11-32 The Prodigal Son      24 here and I've spent most of it in front of this computer screen, enjoying a nice pizza, relaxing, and never once anticipating a call or text message to go out. This "club/bar scene" you people speak of, what is it and where can I watch a live stream of said event?   The text seems so out of place compared to how awesome the picture is.   I have a date. I want to find someone to love and be with and strengthen one another towards our service for God and our relationship with Christ. Could you pray for the best and God's will?   i do. you greet them. then you never see them again.   yeah me too, i want to know too   Yeah, and you only need three D glasses applied to your face with green glow in the dark condam applied to your 6th party pokemon and your own peni5.   Yeah dude, no matter how desperate you are for her love and affection, you deserve better. Fuck that shit. Get out now.    Yeah, just gotta text him. As a guy, if I texted a girl about hanging out and she denied me (no matter the circumstance), I would be afraid to ask again too soon in fear of coming off clingy. So, to demonstrate mutual affection, you should make the move. No worries :D  And be completely honest with him about things. Relationships shouldn't ever be about tiptoeing on glass. Speak your mind, sweets.   So my hard drive on my computer died and I went to an old friend to help fix it. I got to meet his girl friend there and she thought I was so nice that I should meet her friend. I didn't think much of it because usually in those situations, I'm not attracted to the person they try to hook me up with. But this time was different and the girl is very pretty. We finally organized a double date activity together and I was nervous leading up to it because I didn't hear much back from my buddy and I felt almost out of the loop. But he's a dude, and doesn't really care too much about these things, I've come to learn lol. The interesting thing was that his girl friend actually took my number from his phone and contacted me to confirm our plans and stated how excited her and her friend were for dinner etc. I mentioned hiking and ice cream and the girl friend said that "might be better for the second date ;)". That boosted my confidence, as it seemed to demonstrate to me a reciprocated sense of anxiety and excitement prior to getting together, as well as preconceived future plans as a possibility. (I over think things, I know) We did dinner, and I met her. She was very pretty and very quiet, but very kind. I didn't mind the quiet, because I figured we would get to know each other in a more personal situation soon enough anyway. I got her number and she seemed interested in getting together soon. The only issue is that we work different schedules. But we both work at the hospital. I work third shift, she usually works second. And where she works there is no reception for texts etc. My real question, which is probably just me being a nervous nelly, arises from that fact that I texted her the next day about getting together soon and it took her over 24 hours to respond. The eventual response was appropriate and demonstrated interest, but I suppose I just need patience I guess. I'm just so used to people responding immediately, or at least within the same day. I just find it odd that her responses take so long to send and are so generically objective. It's almost like she's never texted before (at least for a girl, as most girls are very expressive and long winded in text form). Her length of time of response and responses are like interacting with a grand parent who just got text and only give you the exact answer you need for the moment. But, as of now, there's mention of getting together in a week when her schedules freed up to get a drink. Which is promising, but I just want to get things going asap. I know that's not a good quality to have, being anxious and wanting it all now (of which I don't show in public) but you'd think if someone was mutually interested in the other party, they too would want to interact as much as possible in the early stages. I suppose all I can do is chill the 'ef out and be patient. I'm just nervous because I desire a relationship to a large extent and want it immediately. But I can't force anything I suppose. The anticipation is just killing me. Any thoughts? Thanks :) Hope I don't come off as a winy biatch.     Yeah...   Job 2:2 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.  And he led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.  6 And the devil said to Him, "I will give You all this domain and it glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.  7 "Therefore if You worship[4][Or bow down before ] before me, it shall all be Yours."  8 Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD AND SERVE HIM ONLY.'  Luke 10:18 And He [Jesus] said to them, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.  Jude 1:9 But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him, but said, "The Lord rebuke you!"  There's many other passages that have the character of Satan or Lucifer or The Serpant/ Dragon as being more than just allegorical. The Bible directly describes the Sins that arise against on this earth stem from our internal desires and evil, the worlds temptations and Satan's schemes. These entities are all seperate from one another.     It was...so fuck you   Hope it has cool crashes :D  	199
 your goals are mediocrity    lol   I think they are. They're playing at a high level.   He's old but not "old".   because i asked this question?   their two best players, guards, are in their prime   they got an experienced center     never heard it before  to us a kit is something that you have to assemble   or the real name of Jon Snow    we'll see   In my mind Steve Nash never left.    So your rommate is a woman transitioning into a man?    he's listed as PF       timmy will list himself as PF no matter what  that's how he do   I have so many stories. If there are Lakers jerseys when I got to my seats, I always sigh.    why would he want to play for the spurs? they're old, he has to play center, and what kind of numbers is he going to get there?   he should come to phoenix, light it up! we run and get buckets, none of this "defense" mess   The obnoxious Lakers fans at Suns games. Seriously drunk lady, stop screaming for a minute.    I hope Love will be able to feed his kids with only $110,000,000. After paying his agent and taxes, that might only be like $70,000,000, smh.    done   and 720   much better!   oh ok, maybe they can fix it?   did you forget him selling picks for cash? we could have had deng and rondo   i don't think it works like that, i think someone recorded the event with a cell phone from 2003   144p? really?    you're  gonna be crushed when he signs with the spurs  just forget about it, if we get him then you can celebrate, but otherwise you're just setting yourself up for heartbreak    don't forget to put "no homo" after your response everyone  *not that there is anyone wrong with being homo, just saying*   any chance cheapskate Robert Sarver would be ok going a little over the cap?   that's wild   that's a lot of money to clap   how does the tax work? is it double each dollar your'e over the cap? or another way?   after James left, yes   i'll have to check them out, thanks   but see, LeBron is hurt early in the season so they have time to develop without him rather than depending on him  it would be different   thx   what? how does that even work? are the numbers listed somewhere?   You mean kind of like how it already is?    If Kyrie and Kevin stay healthy, I say they make the finals and lose.    so how much are the cavs going over the cap and how much luxury tax are they going to pay?   transracial? lol jk   what's it like having a trans roommate? i'm thinking maybe less worse than non trans people?   I hear you! people give so much hate when you're relaying facts and they confuse it as normative positions    lol   i like leaders like bernie, not people catching up like hillary   Why not do a short deal with an option and then he can get upgraded soon enough?   First round pick and any player that didn't have a big money commitment.    does bledose get traded for him or does phoenix keep bledose? maybe we unload the morris twins trash?   Must be Portland Degeneration-X!   We have been here many times before. We get close a lot and are let down.    what are the chances he's traded to the one or two teams he blows off?    it will free him up big on offense for sure   solid analysis    dirk is the exception, not the rule   you should have brought up robert parish   been like he has 3 more contracts left   what about NY?   i think you're reaching just a bit lol   they said this? lol   good points   Thanks.    agenda: break the story or guess correctly so they become big   This is supporting your earlier prediction.   This is enough for me to get my hopes up so I can later be disappointed.   As unlikely as it may be, James leaving is still in the realm of possibility.    good answer, thanks     He's about to turn 30 and signing probably his last contract of his career.   f*ck em   "reload this page"    interesting move!    damn   could he decide to sign and scrap those meetings?    seriously!    with whom?   are you in europe?    why not?    i almost feel bad for knicks fans, almost   thanks bro   why do you think this? because i think we're at best his 3rd choice   that doesn't mean he can't take his sweet time though   it's exhausting    Because I can't think much more of this.    my head and fingers hurt   yes, thanks   ok, thanks   so it could be higher?    That's not soon enough.   Lakers should keep Russell, and unload everything else of value to get as many picks as possible and then try to get Ben Simmons.    Until Ben Simmons comes along.    i'd take him over our politicians who regularly sell us out to corporations and banks   this is true, she's still a lot better than anyone with the bad guys  but she can very far to the left and I think she will Obama us  i only believe Sanders will put americans first instead of the banks and corporations   are you really? lol  because it would be funny that I asked a tax accountant this question   Can't he still get the high contract from Portland and get traded with that contract to Phoenix?    Robert Sarver trading player for cash, like with Deng or Rondo.   [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iTrqHvTk_0)   that's true   this is only impressive if you're 100% straight    and what's your tax rate?    he's trying to pull a kevin costner in draft day   why not? as long as someone doesn't have a no trade clause    please based god!   this is wild! he'd get his rep back up if he pulled this off   We'd finally upgrade from just competing for the 8th seed every year.    Goodwin is better than booker.    what if they dealt him to someone else?    like what?    I'd go for this!    One man one woman.    because it's a reality we have to acknowledge and I am not delusional in thinking what I post or don't post will change the results of the primary election    at committing felonies    Amare? But he doesn't rebound. Only jump shots.    The two largest markets can't get any quality free agents. NBA needs to back to the rigging business.    Bernie Sanders stood for gay rights before it became popular.       Kobe.    fantasy value is taking a hit with him being the 3rd option and not putting up his old numbers    Iowa? do you guys have early voting? I'm hoping you lead the way   What can we expect from Love next season? will he be a 20/10 player again?    so maybe 5'10 or 5'11?   Glad to hear you think for yourself, but you're the exception unfortunately      there is? what is the hard cap? where is that info?   Historically, height has been a factor in presidential elections.    they're using a team based model on an individual based sport  also, their product is shit   you don't have to  like it but it's how many people vote  don't shoot the messenger          Get boards and pass him the ball.       I thought there was not a hard cap in the NBA like there is in the NFL? Is this wrong? Why don't top players like James have their teams spend well over the cap since they're selling out every night and getting them more TV money just for being with the team???      She got money from regular people, but you know Wall Street is eager to have her at the helm. The banks can't give her money fast enough. It would be so sweet to see Sanders wreck the banks!    There's always some chance.    when is the **next** TV deal go into effect? or rather, when does the one about to start expire?   more like 1000%      You can't leave earlier? While it is a gamble, if I were you I would go because it could be an opportunity to be part of something historical that you could look back on. What's the worst that can happen? You waste a tank of gas and an evening?    there is a convergence in Wisconsin       that was not just MSNBC, that was everyone   years of gay rumors apparently          He couldn't see the tax cuts would hurt the economy? really?  you felt safer because he started a war with Iraq? you know the Bush administration taking out Hussein and dismantling their military led to the destabilization of the region and the formation of ISIS, right?   is Te'o bringing his girlfriend?   I want to go!    You're the majority. Most democrats and republicans vote this way. The race is about the people in the middle.  	139
 please santorum, let's foster the political gridlock that is the environment. Hmmm. Maybe we should ostracize science and religion but keep media to make things even peachier.    Cheers to NASA for being one of the most underfunded innovators. It amazes me how ambitious and impressive an association can be with such limited funding.    It's translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky    I just started reading The Brother's K. Any suggestions before I start to really dive into it?    an entrance into a mind deemed insane.  there's something beautiful here but also very sad.       The world or man?   	7
       Thanks for pointing out, it would be great if you can provide any reference to the points you have raised...this is why we all need each other to share knowledge and our opinions...it would be great to hear opinion of other users that know what they are talking about.      	4
 I'm wondering about electives mostly but also prereqs (although obviously there are a ton of shitty prereqs).    Don't you mean platypus bear?   Hey, I was thinking Abe Lincoln  	3
 Marry me. You are beautiful   My main is an asura thief named Lil'Stealthy. Some time ago I played WoW and I loved rogues. Thief just reminds me of the time when I played that pay-to-play game. Now I am happy to say that GW2 is better! You know the addiction to WoW you get when you play it. I had it but now with the help of GW2 everything changed :)    I would really love to get a key  	3
 Confirmed by the devs that lie to us about it in the first place... Not sure how i feel about this whole thing.   I mean shit if he had a chart, hes right...   Ask em to send it to you now, so it can be done by mid april! /s   We don't    *Airhorns blaze as Kruschev gets 360 noscoped.*   Theres a first time for everything i guess.   I for one love the crown victoria police car, for some reason i love that car and the way it looks in a police color scheme. If they were to add something for me it would be a Suburban SUV, and a Suburban police variant. If it holds eight people that will make my month   Curiosity is on around 800 days out of 650, so It's beaten the test as well, and It's still brand new!   I was actually contmplating watching that about five minutes ago! Glad I'm far too picky on netflix.   I don't see any reason both couldn't be sufficient. One for the dog one for the PC kinda thing.   Nvidia GTX 660 is mine, id like to win this for a friend with a laptop for a PC, so he can start a build. Gaben gave me steam sales, which took all of my money. Am starve. Still worth it though.   I imagined him with a Texas accent.  	11

 I remember hearing this story from Stephen hawking.    There was some scientist who were working on the world's first super computer.  When it was finished they asked it "is there a God?".  Right after the man asked his question there was  a bolt of lightning that came down and fried the switch to turn it off.  Then the computer responded "there is now."  I don't know why but that story always stuck with me.   It's not that I don't like them I just think it's played out.  Mecha anime has been around for awhile, just gets stale.  Knights of Sidonia was good though.   If I were one of the SAO survivors I wouldn't have been a front line player.  I would have created a small guild and just hunted monsters the entire time.  I'd leave saving the world to that mary sue Kirito.   Meth.     I'll just wait for the official release, thank you for trying though!   Thank you!      I'm sick and I've been miserable all day but that put a smile on my face.     Ya those two desurve some good lovin.   We should throw something Klein's way.  He's been looking for that special someone.   Yaaa it was just okay.   Ooooooooo I like that blade.   If it's announced tomorrow keep my five dollars and put it towards your copy.   Why don't democrats just call it what it is "the only reason you are up here is because you're being paid to lie".      I really like this.  Hope to see more soon!   I've been watching world trigger sense the beginning.  At first I liked it then I didn't like it, now it's starting to pick up again.   I still really like SAO.  I've read all the light novels and I do not regret a single hour spent doing so.   Alphonse.  After awhile that armor would get kind of annoying, and the whole not having a body thing.   Nahh he's just a good guy looking for some love.   And on top of that couldn't even give a reason why he did it.   Thanks! Will do.   Angel beats  Come at me.   Kamina.     Then absolutely check it out.  Even if you've seen the movie, it's such a great horror story.   The shinning.  Don't make the same mistake I did and read it during a snow storm.   Best ending to any videogame ever!   I didn't sleep last night, I just finished.  Wow, all I gotta say.   r/theydidthemath.  If you've never heard of this subreddit before...they're gonna love you.   It's not on my netflix yet.   I couldn't even finish reading that I was laughing so hard.   I thought Death Gun's mask in SAO2 was pretty badass.   Fuck 'em.  Take them to the cleaners.   That never occurred to me, Thank you.   You are a fan of soul crushing cuteness.   How do kirito and lisabeth survive that freefall at the end of episode 7 in sword art online?   Do the Republicans have enough votes to override it?   TTGL, FMA:B, The devil is a part timer.   That's why we left one spoked and one solid.  Couldn't decide which one we liked more so we're gonna keep it like that for a while and decide later.   Bassani covington hot rod pipes.    	40
 This is a standard during lots of matchups for wukong. Pretty much anyone with high poke or sustain and you're not too clued up on the matchup you Should start flask and pots.   I don't see why this post is dumb at all! A lot of people do make this mistake though and every time I dread to think what it would be like I their shoes....   Probably best to distance yourself for her own good imo. But no harm in being friends with her if you think you can.   Definitely not a good idea dude..... feel for you bro.   Reminds me of the time when I was a child and called my friend a dildo I was about 7 at the time. I said it because it reminded me of armadillo. Till my step dad heard me and told me to go ask my mother what a dildo was ......   Seriously? That tax system is insane. And here we are in the UK with our 10,000 tax free allowance and we still complain.....   Hos before bros dude. Tap it and forget it.  	7

 I completely and absolutely disagree!  The Chinese are a communist state and could harness whatever they needed for their opening.  It was spectacular, but as I was watching it, I thought "at what cost?"  The Brits had a terrific opening themselves, and free world.    However, it was their closing ceremony that I will always remember.  Beat this, anybody free or commie:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiu0lYQIPqE  Edit: hey all you 5 commie online bastards: ONE SHINING DAY BEIJING WILL BE KNOWN AGAIN AS THE CITY THAT THOMAS JEFFERSON INTENDED IT TO BE:  **PEKING**   [I TRULY LOVE PEKING DUCK](https://www.zazzle.com/rlv/i_love_peking_duck_postcard-ra7a36784ec9d4c71b00b7c15a118f8b3_vgbaq_8byvr_324.jpg)   Only during sports and reality shows.  Fun anecdote: when Survivor was a cultural thing, in the season 2 finale, I was watching with my windows open.  Runner-up Colby made a decision that guaranteed him not to win (he took Tina to the final two).    As soon as he did it, I yelled "YOU FUCKING MORON!" out of frustration and anger at the top of my lungs... and could hear people up and down my block laughing.     I re-checked -- yup somebody posted it in there, but only part 2.  Only 18 upvotes.     I dunno.  I absolutely love /r/truereddit -- you have great taste in r/'s.     I'm kind of happy about this.  Uber's great but I never liked how it puts the costs   benefits of driving for them onto the newbie drivers.  It's not a career driving for Uber.        I thought this was a fake due to the euro style of printing of the phone number with a period instead of a dash...  but apparently it's true:  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/06/18/one-photo-perfectly-captures-the-insanity-of-americas-relationship-with-guns/   All I can say is that we were both in ski boots, which is a great equalizer.    I imagine he wears higher heels or lifts when in day to day public.   Nothing wrong with this at all -- he needs to project his larger than life persona and I wouldn't fault him.    I'm just saying I think he's naturally shorter than me -- I, too, was surprised to find this.    He's still a big MF.    Aleksa Palladino  I have been in love with her since her arc in Boardwalk Empire.  I don't speak metric, but an online converter says she's 5.74147 feet and that Lee Pace of 195cm is 6.39764 feet tall.  That's about right actually.  I'm 5'11" and a 5'7" girl would be roughly at the level of my nose.  Had I grown another four inches, shoulder is about right.   He speaks in a Texas "good ole boy" vernacular.  It's not important.  He rarely says what he really means.  Those guys speak in visual cues.  I love them.   I'm old enough to remember Jolt cola, the Red Bull/Monster too early energy drink -- this is the soda can Gordon speared at the beginning.  I had one once.  Once.   Rumor on Dexter: the reason he became a lumberjack is because as a child in that container, he watched his mother get dismembered by a chainsaw.  I just heard this today and was all Sudden Clarity Clarence.     I bet the Turner family isn't going to let GRRM anywhere near that cute doggie.   Really?  If I don't hear the confirmation beep, I try to rescan it once or twice, and then the driver usually nods me back into seating.   I've never been yelled at by a Metrobus driver.   Here you go:  http://img.pandawhale.com/post-29542-Charlie-Brown-pitching-basebal-GVg5.gif   That's exactly it for me.  The Orioles seem nice enough but OMG how I hate their owner.   If you haven't read this two-part long-form article on the investigation into Silk Road, this is a must-read:  http://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/  http://www.wired.com/2015/05/silk-road-2/  I read them in the print edition. Force is a major character, but I don't remember anything about Bridges.    OK Mythbusters, solve this one.   I don't know where they'd fit.  Too long for new, I'm sure tech's already seen them, and I think I saw them on truereddit -- I was suprised because I had to wait a month between part 1 and 2 for the next issue to arrive -- I subscribe -- and there it was online.  The formatting of the print articles was really interesting so I waited it out.     YAY they remembered us in DC!    If a 1960s show is rerun today, the content may be edited by nine minutes to make room for the extra advertisements.  This really infuriates me.  Anyhow, I DVR basically everything and ffwd through the commericals.     I've met Schwarzenegger while skiing.  I'm 5'11" and he's shorter than me.  Maybe 5'9".  I have never seen shoulders that wide though, even under a ski jacket.     Staged.  Why would the frisbee thrower throw it to the dog?   The celtic chief probably trusted a lieutenant to bury them, then the Romans killed anybody who knew where they were buried.   I really hope somebody remembers this article when it comes time to hand out the Pulitzers.  Not only did the journalist write a compelling true crime piece, but also explained the technology seamlessly, not to mention the applicable laws.     I have it -- is that what caused it?   Holy crap you're right.  All three were about the same age -- Gable was six years older.     For anybody with interest, this is a must-read:  http://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/  http://www.wired.com/2015/05/silk-road-2/  I read them in the print edition.  Force is a major character, but I don't remember anything about Bridges.     That's terrific!  Choreographing that must've been like planning D-Day.    edited to add:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Race#Pie_fight   I would like to see a burning squib.

I'd wear a Ford Pinto Owners' Association T-shirt though.   Still there?  I'm typing to you from a rainy Georgetown.  Do you ever miss DC?   Maybe they should've planted a callback?  I dunno.  It's still a pretty bad finale.   They could even take away his red stapler.   I gave up on the first season for that reason.  The red herring of the Muslim school teacher?  I was out.   Whoa.  Thank you for that!     Ah he wasn't a draft dodger by any stretch.  He was 34 when Pearl Harbor was bombed.  That being said, he didn't exert himself to serve.  I have read that the WWII vets resented him for all of his war movies.  From wiki:  America's entry into World War II resulted in a deluge of support for the war effort from all sectors of society, and Hollywood was no exception. Wayne was exempted from service due to his age (34 at the time of Pearl Harbor) and family status, classified as 3-A (family deferment). He repeatedly wrote John Ford saying he wanted to enlist, on one occasion inquiring whether he could get into Ford's military unit, but consistently kept postponing it until after "he finished just one or two pictures".[4]:212 Wayne did not attempt to prevent his reclassification as 1-A (draft eligible), but Republic Studios was emphatically resistant to losing him; Herbert J. Yates, President of Republic, threatened Wayne with a lawsuit if he walked away from his contract,[4]:220 and Republic Pictures intervened in the Selective Service process, requesting Wayne's further deferment.[4]:213  Wayne toured U.S. bases and hospitals in the South Pacific for three months in 1943 and 1944.[4]:253 with the USO[27][28][29] By many accounts, Wayne's failure to serve in the military was the most painful experience of his life.[4]:212 His widow later suggested that his patriotism in later decades sprang from guilt, writing: "He would become a 'superpatriot' for the rest of his life trying to atone for staying home."[30]  U.S. National Archives records indicate that Wayne had, in fact, made an application [31] to serve in the OSS, today's equivalent of the CIA, and had been accepted within the U.S. Army's allotted billet to the OSS. William Donovan, OSS Commander, wrote Wayne a letter informing him of his acceptance in to the Field Photographic Unit, but the letter went to his estranged wife Josephine's home. She never told him about it.[32] Donovan also issued an OSS Certificate of Service to Wayne.[33]   Yeah I saw the one with 37 miles (kilometers?) on the odometer and thought the same thing.  It's a Toyota.  Of course it'll eventually start.   I lived in London in '89 and can't donate either.     Fun fact: in the movie Invictus, Mandela gives a copy of the poem Invictus to the rugby captain.  In real life, Mandela gave him this speech.   Erin Cummings -- Sparty's wife in Spartacus -- is in the mix, too.     Yeah I know.  Armed guards in a very tight space.  I'd had too much vodka the night before.  It would've been a real problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *What's the problem?*    I reformatted my computer three weeks ago.  Never ending RES used to get me to 1000 or more and is now conking out at 200.   Just now I got "There doesn't seem to be anything here!

 my friend did this in college once. He said he felt like his skin was on fire. So i did what any college friend would do: offered him a beer   Robotrippin   more pets less talk      [Even more](http://imgur.com/KzfjMJy)   PET HIM   I fully admit my prejudice.    More pets.    there's always money in the banana stand   OH MY GOD. ITS THE OP WHO STARTED /r/counting   416,241   damn a 1 month repost  edit: ah yes, down vote the guy who points out that this is a recent repost. I am not objectionable to reposts. But this was just posted a month ago.    No;. That's not enough. Imagine what you think is enough and multiply by about 100. That would be enough.    Oh okay. I posted him there      He's about 24 pounds   Yes mine does that too. He's fat.    Make sure you give them pets. They need pets to survive, without pets they die.    He also snores. He face plants like that every 10-15 minutes. He goes more into the face plant each time.    How did I make it about politics? This is my only post here lol. I posted one time and said "this isn't the place for politics. Go to /r/politics"     You act like Republicans are the only people who hate Obama but plenty of Democrats are distancing themselves from him and don't support him.   This isn't the place for politics. Go to /r/politics.      Exactly!!    His FUPA has special healing powers you see.    Only once, then he kills you. For me, I get three rubs.    I'd still inseminate her powdered meat flaps with my salted slippery sausage.        5 Lucky school.    How's your school counselor?    Hm. Whatever works for you I guess.    No idea. I havent done it.    416,214   Easy go   Little high, little low    i'm rude to people who are jerks and refuse to admit they are in the wrong  That sounds like going out of your way for other people.    416,212   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Bucky   It's not limited to only school aged children. It is a repeated behavior though.   Let me ask another question. Why are you the authority on who deserves to be bullied?    Do you know what bullying is?   I didn't have an awful home life but I did take a good amount of abuse (physical and emotional) from my parents when I was younger.  This statement makes no sense. "I did not have an awful home life, but was emotionally and physically abused"   You understand why these statements are contradictory right?  Also,   1. Where did you stay in Cali?   2. How old are you now?   3. How did you get the money to get there?    Have you eve bullied someone?    You aren't meant to enter the water so it doesn't hurt. It's not going to feel well.    LifeProTip?   [More](http://imgur.com/tHuJK6c)   Don't say no sex. Just have sex once in a while and string the relationship along until he loves you then say "sorry im straight"    Actually you didn't say anything wrong. I mean- that was big news this weekend, even if he wasn't gay, it's still big news. I mean...everyone knew about it.       I just bwiojerved and once I've done that I'm all good.    Well I explained in my first comment. But I can explain again.   A daughter will watch her mother and how her mother is treated by guys and how she deals with the situation. She will watch how her mother, and in this case, how her mother deals with her brother and then she treats situations with men similarly. So let's say she doesn't call the police and just doesn't want her brother to get into trouble because of this- even though it is very serious stuff. If she has a child- that type of behavior/attitude will be passed down her child and so forth. It's learned behavior.

But she deleted her account so I'm guessing it was fake. lol   Social worker, substance abuse or detox center intake specialist, community development jobs, work at a battered women's shelter, college admissions worker, probation officer, depending on your state you can teach high school as long as you take a teacher cert exam- very easy, you can be a substitute teacher. And you don't have to teach sociology- you can teach history, poly sci, or other social sciences at a high school level, public relations at a business, Human Resources at a business, senior or youth service centers.   Lots of things you can do. And there are many resources to help you find those jobs as well.    That's why typically a daughter will act like her mother did in that situation   You can do lots of stuff with a Bachelor's in Sociology.

Looks kind of freaky, almost like a poltergeist lol.    she is awesome   Dirty Work.   Note to self: Sam looked.   Hey look...hot aliens...better have sex with each other      If you look hard enough she's not smiling. It's more of an evil frown with a dash of psychosis.    415,625   Yeah, well she's a good actress though. But...the writing for her has been awful the past couple seasons.   I have to watch Season 5, because I'm invested in knowing what happens. But the whole Lexi shit, was awful   yeah brown note. forgot the official name. thanks    I thought so. And it actually was in the shower this time.    Who Frenched her brother   Dear Falling Skies,   I have been a fan of your show since the first season. I have been most disappointed with this season and yet I will continue to watch the show because now I am unfortunately invested in it. A couple things. I get that the alien's name is Cochise, but when Tom Mason says it it sounds like goat cheese or coat cheese. As a result it has become increasingly annoying to me that every time Tom Mason talks about goat cheese or to goat cheese he says his name. I saw in last weeks episode they said "goat cheese" about 15-20 times in the show. It's annoying and is really ruining the experience with the show.   Secondly, please kill the Lexi storyline it's awful. This whole season has been so fragmented like you had an idea then abandoned it and changed your mind. It's been strange. Also Moon Bloodgood's character has been written has increasingly annoying. She is a good actress don't waste her talent on such trivial lines that make her sound so whiney. Please.   Lastly, stop saying goat cheese's name so much. Please. It's not necessary. I know who he is! Or perhaps you wouldn't have had to do that if you didn't make the alien's from each race all look like each other. Humans all look different. Logically from an evolutionary standpoint it would make sense that other alien races would not all look identical. Some wouldn't even be the same height. This is a common theme in film and television with aliens and sadly you have not learned from their mistakes on this issue.   If you have not listened to anything I have suggested please listen to only this: Stop saying "goat cheese" so much. Seriously quit. It ruined last week's episode.

From IMDB  *The DVD contains a FAKE alternate ending where Average Joe's loses the final match and the film goes to the credits as the announcer exclaims that they are going home with absolutely nothing.

In fact, I'm not even sure a taser *counts* as a gun.  What would happen if you pushed a Taser into a solid surface (the ground, a wall or even a person's chest) and pulled the trigger?  As I understand it, Taser cartridges have blast doors on them that swing open or blow off when the gun is fired, allowing the prongs to fly out.  http://www.taser.com/products/law-enforcement/taser-cartridges  If the Taser was pushed up against a solid surface, I can't see how those doors could open.

 A "bardbarian", if you will.   A paladin named Might. Absolutely uncompromisingly good, to the point of wanting to redeem evil instead of destroy it.   When the evil wizard summoned a pack of rust monsters to eat the metal supports of a dam near a small town, he rode valiantly to face them. After all his weapons and armor were eaten away, he continued punching the beasts in the face. They swarmed him, and pinned him down. Before they were able to subdue him, he grabbed hold of them and leapt from the top of the dam, saving the town at the cost of his own life.  There is a statue dedicated to him in the small town, and an entire tribe of goblins who honor him by being devout worshipers of Tyr.   I think it looks really good. I haven't had a chance to play/run it yet, but I have it downloaded to my tablet, and I'm sure I'll get to it eventually.   I'm more likely to use a couple parts from it to run a space opera game using D D5e, though.   As for that other version, it's probably the best thing to come out of D D4e. It still plays like 4e (unless you tear it apart, which I do if I run it), so I don't ever choose to play it over something else.   Some are definitely better than others. I would even say that there are very few that are genuinely more effective than not using one. I think having them is great, and I actually enjoy tournaments that have tier requirements, though they definitely favor people who are already playing one of those good tier lists.   When I first started playing Warmachine, I would always play tiered lists as high as I could. I don't even know why, I just sort of thought that anything less was slacking. Now I pretty much never play tier lists unless I'm trying something crazy (Darius Field Tests t4), or if it's a requirement at a tournament.    I don't understand what you mean. I'm not even being a smart ass, I legitimately don't know what you are saying.  This is what I think you are saying:  "I want to smash down doors and kill everything with a big ax.  I make an old crippled wizard.  I attempt to smash doors and wield a big ax."   Not looking up rules during the game is one of the great improvements of 5e over other editions. The only time I really wish I had digital tools/books for it is character creation.   Think of the things you want to do in the game.   ~~Make a character that is good at those things.~~   Do those things.  edited: There, is that better?   I was just thinking, it'd be cool if this gave some suggestions for Warnouns within the different factions based on the answers. This would be especially helpful for highlighting casters in low percentage factions that don't normally fit the typical play style.   This is actually really cool. I mean, I own an army for almost every faction, and I can just change my army to fit my preference of the day, but for someone who doesn't know much about the game, who is looking for one faction to start with, this is actually really neat.  Thank you for making it.   I actually just ran a session of IKRPG today. It's my go-to game for rules heavy fast and deadly combat.   There are a couple things that really make the system stand out for me (not to mention the amazing setting). One is the 2d6 dice method. It's a fairly predictable distribution, which allows players to reliably strategize, and the smaller range means that bonuses actually mean something. Someone who is strong will be able to reliably make strength based checks.   Another thing is the two career set up. Even if you only were picking one career there are tons of choices. Having two choices *multiplies* that. When you add in the choices for race and archetype, you can really have a ridiculous variety of character combinations.  I also think feat points help it give the players a great deal of narrative control that is common in more rules light games.  Possibly the biggest draw for me is the fast combat. It's not just one thing, but a big part is that "hit points" don't inflate as you progress. You can get better armor and increase your stats to have more hit boxes, but it never gets to the point where you are just chewing through hundreds of hit points by trading blows back and forth. Street thugs with guns are always going to be dangerous.   For Unleashed, I'm super excited to have access to Hordes races and careers. Like the first books, there are a few things I have to homebrew to fix, and that's a bit annoying, but it's not enough to make me not be excited about what's there (the biggest complaint I have is no rules for ranged based warlocks).    pain in the ass  Assembling is my least favorite part of the hobby. Painting, basing, and playing are all good, but I just dislike the assembly.   You'll need a drill of some kind (I use a dremel, but also [pin vices](https://www.wonderlandmodels.com/media/managed/large/ppv2237-d.jpg) work, and they are good for pinning).   Neodymium 3 x 1.5mm magnets are what I use, and you can get them in ridiculous bulk on ebay for cheap (I got 200 for about $10 shipped).   And then glue. Cyanoacrylate (super glue) works fine for me.   Something you are going to want to be mindful of is poles. When you glue the magnet to one piece, make sure you know what side to glue to the other piece. A trick I use is to put the piece with the magnet already attached into a small thin plastic bag (usually the kind the parts of the mini came in). Drop the other magnet over the first one, and then stick the other piece with glue in the hole on top.  Good luck and have fun (though magnetizing is a p.i.t.a. to me).    Honestly, I've been trying to find that video for several days now, and I can't seem to find it. If I do I'll post a link here.   The thing is, it's easier to get good results with model paint than it is to get the same results with craft acrylics. I use both, but I doctor up my craft acrylics quite a bit (and they still aren't as nice as using my model paints), and the results come out pretty decent.   The main difference between, say, vallejo and craft paint is that the pigment in the vallejo paints is ground down much finer than in the craft paint, and so is less likely to be clumpy or chalky and obscure detail. You also get better coverage easier with better paints (craft paints thinned down take many many coats to achieve the same vibrant color as just a few coats of model paint).  All that said, if it's your first mini, you probably won't even notice. Your first couple models will be kinda bad, but you will probably learn quick enough that you could not waste too much model paint.   Another note, craft paint is totally fine for things like terrain projects, so if you are going to be doing that anyway, might as well start with craft paint on minis, and then just use it for terrain after you upgrade to model paints.  *edit: There was a video I saw before that showed the same color, in both craft acrylic and model paint, side by side on a flat surface, and the difference is incredible. On a figure, the difference is less obvious (still obvious, but less so).   You could go the wargame route and use a measuring tape.   There is Gumshoe. I can't think of many others though, at least not that are specifically designed for that. Definitely not many though.   Ha ha, awesome. Fanatic Pastafarians.   I've never played Hackmaster before, but now I want to.   I understand people that want to play something specific, but I don't think I've ever had as much fun as I have when I've randomly generated my character.   I would probably add rolling randomly for race and class too, leaving gender the only choosable option.   [Welcome to Fun Town.](http://www.reapermini.com/FigureFinder)   Correct. You can run games using nothing more than the Unleashed book.    Well, it's a stand-alone expansion to the Iron Kingdoms roleplaying game (the first book is now commonly reffered to as IK: Full Metal Fantasy to distinguish the two).   There is a subredit devoted to it: /r/ikrpg  On the official site, [all the books available for it](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products), [free downloadable resources](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/downloads), and [official forums](http://privateerpressforums.com/forumdisplay.php?43-Iron-Kingdoms-Roleplaying-Game).  [Here's](http://ikrpg.info/) another useful site.  [Pretty good excel character generator here](https://miniarmyhugetimesink.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/skis-ikrpg-character-generator-pretty-much-does-the-heavy-lifting-for-you-check-it-out/), though I doubt it's updated for Unleashed yet.  Let me know if you are looking for anything else.  **edit:** [Here](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery) is a free starter adventure for IK:Unleashed.   A bit more general stuff: Iron Kingdoms is a steampunk fantasy setting that started as an adventure/setting for 3rd edition D D, then it became a wargame (Warmachine/Hordes), and then it became it's own rpg.   Unleashed focuses on the "wild" parts of the world, with druids, trolls, gatorman, etc. Iron Kindoms: Unleashed is to Hordes as Iron Kingdoms: Full Metal Fantasy is to Warmachine.   It's a pretty rules heavy game, but of the rules heavy games out there, it has some of the fastest combats. This is mostly because combat is very deadly, and rarely lasts more than a few rounds. Character creation is also pretty quick, and uses a two-class (called "careers") system that gives a lot of flexibility to players. It does not focus on making "balanced" characters in the way of making them all equally useful at everything. Instead, the only form of balance between careers is that they all get to have something cool.    Uh, what kind of information are you looking for?   Well, it's better than hiding the railroading under the guise of an encounter that has only one possible outcome. At least my suggestion lets you get back to actually playing the game again rather quickly.    Just say it happens. No need to come up with mechanics for it. If you put it in an "encounter" they will think they have a chance of stopping it.   Honestly, it doesn't matter what you pick because in order for it to work, you'll have to "cut scene" it to make it happen the way you planned. There's no point in saying "You have to do this.", just say it happens and move on. Otherwise someone will say they do something else, and then you'll have to tell them no, and you'll just be wasting everyone's time.   One thing, you've already written the ending. Most players are going to go against your ending, and if they can't, they'll be pretty disappointed. I wouldn't do it unless you know your players don't mind railroading, or you tell them upfront.   You're not going to see a good solution because it's not really a good plan. Think about playing a video game. If you got to the end, and there was no real option except to die, wouldn't you be pissed? Plus, good luck getting all the players to do the same thing. Half might be willing to sacrifice themselves, but the rest probably won't.   I'm not saying it's not possible for it to fun, I'm just saying you are already making it hard on yourself.   The Spellfire Wielder feat from Magic of Faerun (I think) might be close to what you are looking for.    Antimagic or *Antimagic*?   I mean, someone who cancels out magic, or someone who kills magic users?   Buy it and scan it yourself. At the moment, that's the only legal option.   This looks exactly like the case that the old World of Warcraft TCG came in, probably cleaned out with a custom cover paper.  *edit: [Yup, totally is.](http://imgur.com/a/K9OdF) I happen to have one sitting next to me.   Blush sounds like a class in a pulp-noir game or something to me.    No, that is a dragon.   I don't know. I think it's doubly funny that you only called out 'eyeliner', and I can just imagine you thinking about the Blush and Concealer classes (actually super cool names for rogues though).   I'm terrible at picking factions, that's why I pick them all. The only factions I don't really care for are Retribution and Skorne, and it has nothing to do with how they play; it's purely on their aesthetics (anime and trunkless elephants aren't my thing).   Trolls are great. If you are worried about it being too straightforward, try out Jarl Skuld for faster hit-and-run style, or Gunnbjorn for a shooty troll force. We can do beast heavy with Doomshaper or Calandra, and can do the stereotypical melee brick with just about anyone (but especially Grissel). Most of the factions have the same kind of flexibility, and just "flavor" it differently.  The thing that makes trolls trolls is that even when they are doing something else, they are tough. A good Gunnbjorn list is nearly as shooty as a typical Cygnar list, but they are going to be harder to take out since absolutely everyone has tough.    You keep saying "flexible/adaptable". The only factions in this game that don't really fit that bill are the minion factions and Cephalyx.   You can run melee heavy Cygnar, jack heavy Khador, hit and run trolls; it's just not typical in the faction, and there are less warcasters designed to do it well. That doesn't mean there are none though.    [This one](http://www.reapermini.com/FigureFinder#detail/60147) seems like it might be a decent fit.   I think [Horrorclix](http://www.miniaturemarket.com/collectible-miniatures/horrorclix.html) might have what you are looking for. I bought a bunch of them before, and though you might want to re-base them, they are pretty decent minis.   Wrong sub, mate.   Give them out as party favors at birthday parties.   I'd help, but I don't know anything about Pathfinder.   [This](http://paizo.com/products/btpy7z7f?Dungeon-Issue-99-with-Polyhedron-158) might be something to check out though.   I couldn't help but think of [my favorite TV show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcGSP4ucEc0).  	41
 Your mighty Range Rover was defeated by what's it called, bamboo ?    I think the 13'' is fine for your needs. However, as you're going to work with Photoshop/After Effects the bigger screen would be better but it's your decision   never miss an [episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Top_Gear_episodes)   definitely, it uses the same engine as the gallardo/r8 5.2 V10   No issues with the update ?   The ABT Audi RS6 has 5.2 V10 and 700hp and reaches 340KM/h. Imagine a station wagon faster than a Lambo !    An M3 is an M3    In the bookmarks bar the websites are not loader it's just their name. Pinned sites means exactly that, loaded websites but as you see them frequently they're pinned so they're less intrusive    Why not an external hard drive ?   It's pcie since the first retina MacBook Pro 2012    The iOS 9 in the iPhone 4s runs like a charm   Take it to an Apple Store    I think you'll only benefit 16gb ram if you really need it. The 2015 also has better battery and the new trackpad    The price of the maxed 13" MacBook is almost the same as the base 15" I think it's worth it    Light Mac desktop only a Mac mini    I guess only time will tell   yeah I know   Sure is but I never heard a person with a 13in rMBP saying it is heavy and difficult to carry everyday in a backpack   That's definitely not normal ! Take it to an Apple store   he was convinced the P1 was faster   I'd love to see which one was the fastest around the track .. We'll never know   You have a good excuse :D I was thinking that ! In that case you have to check if your tweaks are working in the latest firmware.   you can only update to 8.4 or 9 beta Can I ask you why are you not updating the iPhone ?   it's not possible, it's possible the other way round though   iFunBox      If he's considering the 15" of course he can afford the extra ram    Macs don't write to NTFS drives by default    Tuxera is essential if you want to write to NTFS drives    Hyperdock should be built in. When you have multiple windows of the same application you have to right click on the icon on the dock and choose the window you like, with it it's faster and doesn't require any clicks    Your mighty Range Rover was defeated by what's it called, bamboo ?   I know and it saves a lot of battery    It's okay :) I just prefer the bigger screen and (better) speakers as well as 16gb ram as I have a lot of things running at once    Yes but windows users are used to alt+tab and in OSX it doesn't work as they intended it to. Sure there is the correct shortcut Another thing: if you have 2 windows of the same application running on 2 different spaces, if I want to open a third windows on a different space, I click on the icon on the dock and it doesn't open a new window, it takes me to a random window of the running application     alt+tab doesn't switch between windows. Instead, switch between apps   I don't do video and the base model is already expensive for me...    For me it'd be a main machine. The 15" is definitely a desktop replacement and with  its portability it's a great machine. Sure it's expensive but I'm yet to hear someone that bought one and was unhappy with it. Everyone I know say it's the best computer they have ever owned   Yes ! It also smells like brand new    only in September maybe    13" 2015 model is actually 4 months old, great deal !    I have to carry my laptop almost everyday, but I think the slightly bigger and heavier MacBook is worth it. In a backpack it won't be a big difference between the two    Wait for the new OnePlus    I don't need the dedicated gpu, and 250GB is enough to for me. Need the ram and the cpu is pretty much the same. I believe it flies !   It's the Albanian rozzers!   ... It's time to end, thank you very much for watching, good night   I agree with you, the end was a bit off the the rest of it was absolutely TopGear! Jeremy wears a tie and says he is not an old truck driver with egg on his shirt and Hammond arrives with egg on his shirt. The modifications to the truck "sports lorry". It was a normal special with a lot of laughs   glad i'm not alone   don't forget Burma!   yes, filmed with a drone. Also from the burma special   imagine the g force  	50

But salon is very fairweather progressive and much too neoliberal for me, so you can only get so much   How?  Bernie Sanders has an economic platform that benefits groups in poverty, which are disproportionately African American and Woman American.   By teaching people how voting Bernie Sanders will vote themselves money via common sense middle class economic ideas, like raising the minimium wage and expanding social security, Bernie Sanders can beat Hillary Clinton.   It is just a matter of educating and teaching people why voting for neoliberalism never works.       100%   Agreed. I don't think he will run, and if he does he will be competing for HRC voters, not those of Bernie Sanders. It is like how Marco Rubio is going jead to head with Jeb being advantageous to Rand Paul. If Kasich gets in the Republican side, it will dilute the Jeb vote even more if more the establishment vote gets even further diluted.

I am not saying Bernie will be the nominee, but hillary was rejected last time, and she hasn't done anything to bolster her resume since.    Randal. His name is Randal.

Political commentators fear homosexuals, confined in a barracks, will turn into serial rapists. They then try to spread that fear among the populace    Literally *dozens* of thousands!   http://imgur.com/cHWcbzC   I'm doing what I have to for now, but a full reset means my credit will be irreversibly destroyed.  But I'm going to need to make sure my next place can be paid for by myself, only.  I'd rather be paying all of a $650 rent, compared to hopefully paying $640 out of an $840 rent.   Oh, yeah... I'm sure my roommate fornicates himself regularly, though, for some reason he keeps getting pussy... it's maddening.    No, not really.  Sure, family is more likely to be helpful. I can crash with my dad if I need a place, and can count on my mom for help... But my roommate has already proven he won't help me if it doesn't benefit him directly, including being more likely to buy drugs than pay the rent.  My coworkers will skive off work, leaving me to deal with it all or work overtime.  My boss doesn't understand that prices and rent have gone up, but at least they'll let me get advances on my paycheck (which basically means I am stuck working for them).  What's worse is that? I can't even drop everything and disappear.   The other option was that the team was set up by the Joker...   Honestly, if I were needing to keep the police occupied during a crime, getting them confused about their own radio transmissions isn't a bad plan.   Not always true. Half the people I know can go fuck themselves.    The Bible never says "hate black skinned people", but it certainly supports xenophobia.    Then you start noticing how every time they hit each other on the head, they slam their foot down on the mat.   None of my family watches NASCAR, but I still knew.    How are most rapists men?   Because men have the equipment, and don't have to use foreign objects if we don't want to?  Because female rapists are underreported?  Because some women lie about rape to get men in trouble? I *hope* that one is rare anyway.  A combination of these factors?   Bravely, bold Sir Robin rode forth from Camelot. He was not afraid to die, O, brave Sir Robin!   When did/does three come out? Did I miss something?   No, it definitely sucks, and I wasn't happy that I had to do it.   [](/tavidepressed) okay...   I don't know about the first question, but maybe.  As for the rest, it wasn't a full redemption. She had to pay half the room rent each night (give or take) on her own card, but apparently the card they originally used was marked Lost, making it invalid.  I certainly understand the frustration they had, but it wasn't something we could just sit on for an indefinite period of time. I actually gave them longer than I gave the other two declinations. But we were already having to turn people away at that time.  From our standpoint, we easily could have resold the room, waiting until 11pm to cancel, but there would be (and I'm only exaggerating a little here) 100 renters we *could* have taken in instead of the person with the bad card. But our policy is simply that if your payment is not valid, we cancel your room. Because otherwise, we will get people making reservations with bad credit cards because (a) they don't have to wait for a return on the authorization and (b) they can avoid paying a no-show charge if they decide not to come in after all.   Shit... I guess I lose my nerd privileges today.   You know what, say what you will about the shitty bureaucrats wanting to be assholes, I'm pleased that they opened up for business that quickly.   Most of the time, the debt *is* legitimate, even if they screwed up and it wasn't verifiable.  You borrowed the money, ran up the bill, or used a service, and didn't pay for it. You know that you did it, and you don't want to or can not pay.  Because roughly half of the debts bought by debt collectors are not documented properly, especially after it has gone through multiple collection agencies, it is a simple process to *say* you don't recognize it and demand proof. If they give proof, they can't accuse you of lying (many people forget about the doctor visit from 4 years ago) and you can work with them to get back on track, including making a pay to delete arraignment. If they can't give proof, it disappears...   Loyalty point redemption. The only monetary payment was the bad credit card.   Technically, yes.  If there is no federal law prohibiting it, then it is legal on a federal level, but can still be prohibited by state or municipal law.  For example, most traffic laws do not have parallels in Federal law.   They are waiving the flag. That flag doesn't apply anymore.  They aren't waving the flag, though.   It's hard to say. It'd be based on whether the churches get enough anti-gay voters riled up.   If I were to want to get around those features, couldn't I simply remove the +XXXX information or move around the periods?  I think a Masked email is better.   Yeah, but while she did enough damage to solo Titan, she still needed help.  So she didn't solo Titan.   Summer weekend in a beach town means a full house.  We went through the arrivals today, as is tradition, and preauthorized the credit cards on file. One of the few reservations to decline was a Brand Loyalty Partial Payment room.  After confirming that we are allowed to cancel, I called the guest and left a message about the room. It was about 8:30, but we were already having to turn people away who wanted to pay properly for the room. I gave them until 9:30 to update their payment, or it will be canceled.  9:30 passes without contact, and I cancel the room as promised. The room is almost immediately rebooked by a new guest.  10:10, we finally get a call back from the guest, a sweet old lady who sadly was brought to tears that I had to give away the room, but she seemed to understand the situation.... Then she called her son, Fezzik.  The conversation was a little too long for a post here, but suffice it to say every sentence out of his mouth was about my incompetence.  I let it slide for a while, telling him what happened. No, sir, we don't attempt the card until the day of arrival because we don't want an issue with voluntary cancellations. No, sir, we can't hold an invalid reservation indefinitely. No, sir, we don't have another room of that type of give. (We only had singles for the multiple days).  Incompetence, incompetence, incompetence. Every answer I gave as to why we can't simply rebook the room as it was an excuse to hide my incompetence.  I finally broke. "Sir, you keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."  Obviously, that didn't help at all, but it was so satisfying. I calmed down a bit after.  We traded question and answer like this for a good 10 minutes, and I was getting more agitated because I was constantly repeating myself and trying to deal with other phone calls and guests who I could help.  I finally told him flat out, "the only incompetence here is your own. We trusted that you gave us a valid card, we contacted you as soon as we knew it declined, and we gave you time to fix the problem. If you have any *new* questions, I'll try to answer, but otherwise I'm going to hang up now."  As soon as the word incompetence came from his lips again, it didn't take long, I released the call.   Yeah, I found that out the hard way.   I used to work for Verizon, and while those terms were the justification at that time, +-10 years ago, the reality was that it didn't matter which phone you got (or even if you got a phone at all), or when you cancelled the contract, the ETF was $250.  Our standard practice if you called in during the last month of service was to tell you to wait until the day after the contract expires to cancel  (which usually means we've charged your card for another month and you have to wait to be refunded the difference.   I paid to delete a debt, and it never disappeared... they just straight up lied to me.   Actually, yes.  You can give them a masked email address, using Blur, and you will get the contact from them with the ability to block them later on.   For Junk Debt Buyers, the business is a numbers game. They *know* that most people are not going to pay in full, and many people will either refuse to pay or find a loophole to get out of the debt.  So, they get lax on the paperwork.  The more your debt is, and the more profit it stands to make them, the more likely they will have the appropriate paperwork.  If you owe some company $100, you can probably get it thrown out.   That's the thing.  It *is* immoral to use a technicality to void a legitimate debt, but it is also immoral to do many of the practices done by Junk Debt Buyers, like call people 10, 20, 30 times a week.   Yes. We are reaching critical mass on stupidity over this stupid flag.    No, that is a program on TruTV.      Amazon, Wal-Mart, and other stores banning the flag has led to people removing the flag from depictions of the Dukes of Hazzard's General Lee.   Plus, workers reportedly have had to work much longer hours than 40 in a week. Assume that they work 60 hours a week, that makes the median hourly pay ~$2.00, *before* they start charging for things like rent, toothpaste, clothes, etc.   Foxconn does things like lock workers inside the building, has living quarters on site, everything the workers need to live is sold by the company... It might not *legally* be slavery but...   You got 15 tons, what do you get? Another day older and a-deeper in debt.   And one in a field in Pennsylvania.   Um... no. It literally refers to the reddish color of their skin, compared to the white and black skin colors.  And it was originally applied by Native speakers.  Obviously it *became* a racial slur, but just as "nigger" was just a slurred form of "negro" (and thus the origin of the term "slur"), but it has nothing to do with scalping.   They could also include coupons for Always with Wings, DVD box sets of the TV show Wings, or gift certificates to Wing Stop.   Honestly, if the commercial specifically said "7,000,000 points gets you a jet," then they should have known someone would take it seriously. Many commercials show ridiculous things being done with real products that are being offered.  What they *should* have done is say "Save up enough points, and you might even get a jet!" and then had a remote controlled jet in the catalog.   Actually, Red Bull could easily make a promotion where they mail out sets of wings to people who buy their product.  And they could have a lot of fun with it. 10 points could get you a pair of [pilot's wings](http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p100/lastofthebenders/Private-AC-Misc/DeluxeWings-Sil-600.gif), 100 could get you a set of [water wings](http://swimmingsafari.com/images/uploads/water-wings_48710_3.jpg), and 1000 could get you a pair of [costume wings](http://delicateconstruction.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/bird-costume-3.jpg)   It means that if you made an ad that said "You could buy, like, a *million* apples for $20", then you can easily defend that you didn't *literally* mean a million, just a lot of apples.  But if you said "Apples, 3 for $1" then you actually mean 33 cents per apple.   [](/wlexcited)Only the greatest live action series from Japan!

Weyland-Utani made the weapons system in Firefly, and Firefly links with BSG (2003)... The map should have the listings the other direction.   http://www.poobala.com/battlestarandfirefly.html   They count Morleys cigarettes because they don't really exist.  The theory states that it isn't that shows reuse props, it is that they are real companies, in-universe, and two people using the product will mean they are both in that universe. It is admittedly flimsy, and used to expand the connections as far as possible.   He has that backward. Munch was in X-Files.   COPS is generally excluded because it is not a fictional show, and uses no fictional characters.  The use of COPS in a show, such as X-Files, is there to imply that X-Files is occurring in the Real World. Including that show would be like saying Family Guy is real, because we watch the news.   You have the X-Files one backward, Baltimore Detective John Munch was a character on both St. Elsewhere and X-Files, then he went on to appear in Law   Order and star in SVU. The Sesame Street episode was obviously a joke, so we can throw that out.    Okay. The connection between Star Trek and Seinfeld goes through the John Larroquette Show.  Star Trek and JL both reference the fictional company Yoyodyne (Not necessarily canon). JL crossed over into Frasier (Canon), which crossed into Caroline in the City, to Friends, to Mad about You, to Seinfeld.  Happy Days is only connected to Friends directly through St. Elsewhere, through a very long connection that I won't spell out.  The problem with the theory is in the fact that many of there "crossovers" are really just two completely different shows referencing the exact same fictional company (like the Star Trek example above), and aren't really in the same universe. Plus the fact that some of the crossovers are specifically alternate universes or TV shows within the TV show, or silly non-canon appearences, like the famous John Munch on Sesame Street.  It's an interesting example of how TV shows connect with each other, but it isn't exactly canonized.   And they are all in the [mind of an autistic child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Westphall#The_Tommy_Westphall_Universe_Hypothesis).   I have that book!  It's used for the Big Eyes Small Mouth RPG, but is also a great art book for SM fans.   Heck, one only needs to look at the latest few Sentai, Kyoryuger, ToQger, and Ninninger, to see how prevalent the cowboy love goes.  Kyoryuger featured Kyoryujin Western, a gun-slinging giant robot, ToQger has the Sixth Ranger, ToQ-6gou, who wears a duster and wide brimmed hat in his Shadow form, and Ninninger has the Sixth Ranger Starninger, a cowboy/ninja that [transforms with a hamburger](http://www.orendsrange.com/2015/02/shuriken-sentai-ninninger-first-look-on.html?m=1)   My phone app just uses the words for the flair.    At the same time, if I call a woman a "pussy", I'll have a bad time no matter how I meant it.   Sorry, but that is only if you are a fool.  The point was clearly, even without the tags, to juxtapose the slaughter of pigs with the slaughter of Jews, to get people to think about how bad it is to kill another animal.  I don't agree with her assertion. But she is not saying that men are pigs in any way, shape, or form.   Yeah, this is just a bad post for here.  She was saying that pigs were being treated like Holocaust victims, not that men are pigs.   If you know about computers, but don't want to spend the time building a PC, it isn't terrible.  You can look at and compare specs, and can choose for yourself which is right for you. If you have to ask "which of these PCs will do X?", then you aren't informed anyway.  Ideally, a tech-savvy person will build their own rig, but that isn't always a possibility.    Sorry you are getting downvoted, but you can get glitches when using outdated tech.  For example, if your graphics card is underpowered or damaged, you can see graphical artifacts or even outright errors in the rendering. Problems in storage or memory can lead to a level not setting up right, and errors like "falling through the world".  Sometimes it *is* the computer's fault. But if you are having trouble playing Batman: Arkham Knight... Then it's probably the game.    Fair enough about targeting, but for most people the yoga Nike commercial is cringeworthy.  Like the fact that they never show an actual identifiable Nike product. Those yoga suits could have been any brand at all, and we'd never know.   And this time, he'd be right.    Ironically, it is one passage that *should* be taken literally.   Funny, I though that it meant more simply "Man will be the Serpent's mortal enemy".  Genesis, after all, was a myth, not unlike the Greek mythology, and they wanted to explain why we hate snakes and why they attack people.  Because, "snakes have poison, and are very protective" isn't reason enough for us to hate each other.   Yeah, the people that came up with that myth were going by things like changes in skin color after the disembodied head was slapped.  You would certainly feel the pain of the axe, but not for very long.   Honestly, because of the fact this app can't access play data of most games, it will be next to impossible to police.  On the other hand, the payout can be automated to not require mediation. The two players come back to the app, and it simply asks "who lost?" The loser presses that button, releasing the funds.  If they have a game in progress (neither player presses that they lost) for a certain period of time after the end of the game, then the game is simply cancelled, and both players are refunded. The game gets marked as abandoned, and used as a player ranking (using a percentage of completed games).  If you see someone with a low completion ranking, you decline to take their bets.   Of course you wish to be paid for your work, that is always important, but you shouldn't ignore the power of borrowed books for growing an audience.  When I read that one book, the author initially earned no money off of me beyond my friend's purchase. I ended up buying 10 books of his.  Kindle Lending Library and Kindle Unlimited have a unique situation where they can pay you for every borrowed book, giving you an income while potentially growing your fanbase.  I can't decide for you if it is right for you. It is always your decision. But the factors should look beyond the bottom line.   Any sort of call that refuses to give basic information gets the business from me.  If it is important enough that they have to speak to my manager at 8 in the morning (my boss isn't available until at least 10), they can let me know the basics.   Oh! You mean on the PC...   Like many good writing prompts, I went a little off-topic.  http://wrongmlpletters.blogspot.com/2015/06/let-your-pony-flag-fly.html   The joke is that he is using a pushpin to attach the condom to the board... leaving a hole in it.   What was wrong with the Diablo 3 launch? I didn't get into it until after the PS4 launch.   By feminazi, he means feminists who wish to kill or subjugate all men... frankly, this guy is a conspiratard.   No, i mean how this girl's nude photos taken while she was underage were posted...  We know that the subverse was banned. We know basically why it was banned. The only question that requires "proof" is whether *this girl* was the one being posted.  You're right, without that proof, she could be lying about her "involvement" in the situation. But that subverse was banned because of naked children.   It is a valid argument, for one simple reason.  If you try and stop me from commenting because I *could* post a link to child porn, then you are in the wrong.  If you try and stop me from commenting because I *actually* post a link to child porn, then you are taking a correct action.  Removing free speech and expression because of a hypothetical is never appropriate.  How does this factor into your question?  You postulated that they only removed your link, and the subverse that it was posted on, because of what it means to their bottom line, and not because of any moral reason. And again, I ask... Isn't that enough?  If they start banning people for *moral* reasons, then we'll start seeing bans of unpopular subjects like /v/atheism, /v/christianity, /v/politics, /v/libertarianism, or other subs that one person or another finds objectionable.  By only banning people when it becomes *legally necessary*, they protect persons like yourself while allowing the average, law-abiding user to spout out whatever shit they want.   Did I say it wasn't significant?  I don't know how many they had before the exodus, but only about 1/4 of the new users joined the new FPH, based on the sidebar. (~11,000), which certainly indicates that many of the people who left did so because of that controversy.  /v/MeanwhileOnReddit has ~19,000, /v/news has ~21,500, /v/technology has ~20,500... Obviously, there is some overlap, but FPH is a sub that will be drowned out eventually.   Is that not enough?  Their goal was to have a place where if you wish to post something morally repugnant, you are allowed to. The one thing you can't do is use the site for illegal purposes, like sharing naked pictures of an underage girl.  If we don't have the freedom to say something horrible, then we don't have freedom to say anything.   Yes and no. I heard about Voat after reading about on of those subreddit bans, but I was never a part of that group.  With over 45,000 accounts, it's unlikely that most of them were on FPH   Almond or Vanilla Extract in sauces, along with an almost random mix of spices.  My goal is to make it so I can not smell the sauce while it cooks.   This is a fair enough answer. Yes, the initial userbase was people that left Reddit for one controversy or another and to avoid bans against subreddits. This means that many horrible places will pop up early on.  There is a growing number of new users there that come over out of curiosity, and don't condone the actions of... certain subs.   Voat is to Reddit as Raddit was to Digg.  The only question we have left is whether Voat will completely supplant Reddit, or if it is too similar and not enough people move over.   It should be noted that because of incidents like this, Voat has banned /v/jailbait   Past me cleaned out present me's bank account thanks to a shitty friend.    In all seriousness, I might use this idea... I have a blog that I let flounder, with wrong versions of My Little Pony write to their princesses...  I could start using/making up news stories for them to write about.   Borrowing gets you fans.  Selling gets you customers.  I started reading the third book of the Phase series, Juxtaposition, from a friend, and liked it so much I went out and bought the rest.  If your work is good, having a free sample is the *best* advertising. It's the reason Barnes and Noble is set up like a huge reading room.   Here I thought the point of writing was to have your book read.   Yeah, well blxlk u, too!   At least Watch_Dogs isn't doing this shit.  You want a different take on GTA with some puzzles thrown in, and it's your game.  Otherwise, you might not like it, and that's okay.   I would assume they lose more money by calling their user base idiots than they stand to make by selling shit to idiots.   I deleted after the Beta.  I liked the game, kind of. Just not enough to pay for it.   Question  I heard a rumor that they were making people rebuy the $80 bundle, even if they owned the game, and what you get for that is like 3 emotes...  What all do you actually get?   Right next to the Jolly Ranchers.   This is a good point.  If you need him for anything else, counter offer for the 20% he wants, with the previously paid wages being an advance on that. (Ironically, if the game doesn't do well, he could end up owing you.)  If you don't need him, make copies of all previous communication, including the fact that he was working as a contractor for you, and is not entitled to a percentage.  Either way, terminate your relationship with him as soon as possible.    I agree with you.  All we can be sure about is that any significant other of Marlene was not in the Order.   That's the beauty of it.  Everyone else is *just an adventurer* there to help you if you need it. You are the Chosen Hero. That's why nothing anyone else does has a lasting effect on your game.  And they say there are others, but for the most part, you are the hero. It allows you to immerse yourself more easily than if you are just a small cog in a machine.    James and Lily were married for over a year, as were the Longbottoms.  If (and I emphasize the if) Marlene was born a McKinnon, and married in the incredibly short time between the picture being taken and her death, it stands to reason that her marriage might not have been common knowledge.  If she was already married to a non-Order member, then she wasn't a McKinnon in school. (Yes, she technically could have been one, but the odds of such a pairing are incredibly low, even in a close community like the Wizarding World).  If she was never married at all, then the family that was killed was likely her parents.  But, the Order itself was a very tight group. It is highly unlikely that a wife would be in the Order without her husband (Moody goes through a number of couples in the photograph), so the assumption is that she is not married, since a husband was never married.  Now, there is another possibility that hasn't been mentioned yet...  Marlene may have been gay. We know that Rowling intended for some characters to be homosexual, and an unmarried woman in a fighting position may not have married because one woman can not marry another (We never see such a marriage at least.). In this scenario, Moody would have respected her as a person and comrade-in-arms, but not been comfortable talking about such matters with others.  Which one is right? Only JK Rowling knows for sure.    That, my friend, is the $100,000 question.   And it will be stupid.  Gloriously stupid.   Corpus Christi - The Water Street Bar and Grill and Oyster Bar.   The passage where Moody shows off the picture, he calls her "Marlene McKinnon" and then states that she died 2 weeks after the picture was taken.  Even if she was born a McKinnon, and married in between those two events, she would have been remembered as Marlene McKinnon.  If she was born a McKinnon, then she almost certainly died unmarried, and her parents and siblings were killed with her.   Here is the part that will blow your mind...  Unless there was additional info in Pottermore, the books never mention her husband by name. Marlene was standing alone in the picture of the Order. If her husband was the McKinnon, she could have been named *anything* during school. If she was named McKinnon, it is likely that she wasn't married, and the family that died included her parents and siblings.   I think the problem that these authors have is the fact that we don't know a lot about the people that went to school with the Marauders.  So, authors latch onto any little detail they can find and figure out a way to include it.  Lily's best friend in Hogwarts, at the very beginning, was almost certainly Severus. They knew each other before school for years, and were all but destined to be together... until they were Sorted.  With Lily in a different House, she would have made new friends with her fellow First Years, and quickly gained a closeness associated with "best friends", but she didn't drop Severus until he called her a Mudblood.  Assuming Marlene was the same year and House as her, she could have been one of her closest female friends, explaining why she cried when she heard the news, but it wasn't the same level of closeness that she once had with Severus or grew to have with the Marauders.  Thus, Lily's best friend was Severus, and when that friendship died she eventually latched onto the Marauders directly, becoming close enough with them to trust Wormtail and Sirius with her protection just as much as James did.   He had an intelligent pet monkey.   The Tidal goes in, the Tidal goes out. You can't explain that.   I just wanted to say to Mr. Z, that I am completely sorry for this news[,](http://www.nelson-haha.com/) as I always hoped that this service would be so much better than Spotify and other services that dare to cater to the average user.   Seriously. Having emotes is a cute thing and all, but not worth $80.   Three emotes?  He wants you to buy the whole new game... for 3 emotes?   I'll get the popcorn, because you'll be dead before paramedics arrive.    Rule one of self defense, avoid the fight whenever possible.    Maybe, but at the same time, freedom is something that should only be taken away with good reason.  The question should not be "Why do you need that?" It should be "Why can't I have it?"   I want to built a neutron bomb in my backyard...    Why would you need that?     I want one, why can't I have it?   **Because you'll kill everyone trying to make it!**   Actually, I could see an episode where Jerry entertains a complete stranger who just happened to pop in.   Because there is nothing that says American Freedom like forcing people to drive a specific car they don't want.   Seriously. I had forgotten about that song entirely... and then I read the title, and a wave hits me.  It was a powerful song    Time Magazine's worst Man of the Year award...   Seriously.  I don't have a problem with them choosing Miles Morales to be the MCU Spider-Man. It would be a *great* way to differentiate the character from the Sony Pictures Spider-Man and Amazing Spider-Man.  I also understand the reasoning behind using Peter Parker for the specific role, because of the back story and the overall effect of him revealing his identity during Civil War.  On the broader sense, if you want to see a new powerful black hero, make a new one (like the new Ms. Marvel). Or take an older one and make him into a more powerful character (like the MCU Falcon). But don't change the race of existing characters and pretending it doesn't change their history.   I nominate that to be OP's flair.    Yes, but the money has to come from somewhere.  AC makes (let's say) $5,000,000. They take $1,000,000 of that and put it to develop a new AC game. They then take another $1,000,000 and start developing a new IP, like Watch_Dogs, which may or may not profit.  If WD makes enough, they will do the same thing, take some of the profits and make WD2, and some to make a third game. If it doesn't, then they abandon the IP and just work on the third.   Good luck on your work.   But we are talking about 15 ships equaling all car emissions in the world. Even if Hummers combined was a significant portion of the car side, it would be peanuts compared to the ship emissions.  Cutting the ship emissions by 5% would do better than cutting Hummer emissions by 50%.  Obviously, the headline is ignoring that it is different kinds of emissions, I understand that, and my initial joking comment was not meant to address that issue.   If they simply return it, let's say they got it in their hands and decided they didn't like it, then it rarely hurts you to allow the refund. You may want to grant only the partial refund to cover your shipping costs (call it a restocking fee), and you can sell it again.   Okay. In regards to legality, making a print of a character has a few things you have to watch for.  First and foremost, is transformation. If you are simply copying an iconic Wolverine comic book cover, then you are violating both trademark and copyright laws. You didn't design the piece, you didn't design the character. It isn't yours to sell.  Second, is replicability. The more easily replicated the artwork, the less likely it will be sued over. You try to sell scribbled drawings of Wolverine on paper, and you'll probably be hit with a C D. You make one 10 foot tall sculpture, and you probably will be congratulated by the artist (unless you piss him off).  That leads into the third point, flattery. If you make said sculpture with Wolverine being raped by Kitty Pryde, they'll come onto you like a hobo on a ham sandwich. If the sculpture depicts him in his iconic crouching pose with blades extended, they will look at it more favorably.  Fourth, and maybe the most important, is competitiveness. If you make a comic book featuring their character, then you are potentially cutting into their profits. Changes you make to the character can erroneously be seen as endorsed by the creators, which leads to problems. The aforementioned 10 foot tall statue, on the other hand, doesn't compete with their property. The people that would buy such a thing will probably be buying the legit art, too.  Now then, Etsy is in a strange position. They don't make anything, except the website. However, enough people are on it that they have to tread extra carefully to avoid C D letters from the property owners.  Because of the points I laid out before, most companies are okay with the creation of fan art. They even encourage it. But if too much goes on in a site like Etsy, Marvel may come down on them.  In response to your question, superhero *posters* would be a definite infringement based on competitiveness. If you wish to fight a C D for your work, you would likely lose, due to the fact that Marvel and DC sell their own posters of characters.    Okay... refund policies for artwork are a very touchy subject.  You should ensure your product is packed well, giving extra space in case of box damage etc.  If you do that, you can have your refund policy be on a case by case basis. Officially, you list no refunds. Then, if someone contacts you and asks for a refund for a reason you don't think is valid (for example, if they call you a few days after getting the package, saying it was damaged in transit), you can simply say "no refunds". The rare case where they show you that something horrible happened, you can grant an exception.  After all, you are the owner of your "business".  	130

 I know nothing about the issue, but it seems logical to me that what needs to be signed is the EXE since Windows doesn't analyze what exactly it is doing (namely running a built-in jar somehow).   OMG I'm wearing a crucifixion shirt.  People should realize more how Christianity is designed to be a religion of assimilation. Winter solstice? CHRISTmas. All you need to do? Accept Jesus a the Lord and Savior, no reading of the Bible required. The religion's symbol? Two lines crossing more or less orthogonally (see also twin tower remains).   No, Jesus said [whatever they wanted him to say by means of cherry-picking and "interpretation"].   I think it's more correct to say: They do quite understand that their rights end where everyone else's start. It has been mankind's endeavor throughout history to find out what the Golden Rule *means in practice*, where the line between selves truly is. The wingnuts' minds are just so bent that their answer to the GR problem is completely wrong.   To be fair, the Bible is designed to destroy its user's pattern matching system quite thoroughly. The Bible wants you to believe that it makes sense, yet it is very obviously self-contradictory - except if you bend over backwards. The Bible *instills* compartmentalization. "Yes, but that's not the same." is a necessary mechanism in every Bible-believer's mind. The Bible does what magic mushrooms do, except you're tripping all the time: It unleashes the power of fantasy and will on the mind. Handled irresponsibly, this has terrible consequences. ... Oh look. A billion people who are doing this. The world has no problem at all!   I think you're relabeling things. Maybe you are right, and maybe the correct term for what you're defining even is "religion" - but society as a whole massively interprets the meaning of the word differently, so it would be useless to give the definition you give without using a different word. - I suggest you use a different word for this, otherwise only confusion can result.   That would work. But what about the actors? Wouldn't they be actually abord the ship? The implications of the root comment's hypothesis are gigantic.   If you know so damn much more than I do, then you will be able to give yourself eternal life better than I could. To test this, I have decided not to give you eternal life.

Article ends with:   Whether this occurs in the cosmic version depends on how dark energy behaves in the distant future - a question that Frenk describes as the realm of pure speculation.

But to me, it's a plothole. It doesn't have to be a "paradox". It's (Would be.) just completely against how the characters should behave, how a sane person would act.  For example, here's something from the *terrible* movie that Taken 3 is. Not really bad spoilers, because one key event is early in the movie, and this whole thing I describe is not just asinine, it's also quite unimportant. And the movie is shit, as I said. So: [Dad puts a laced drink in a place where he knows his daughter would find it, with a note saying "drink me right away" or somesuch. She does so and goes to school. In class, she asks if she is excused because she feels nauseous. Goes to the girl's rest room (Apparently the only one the school has. Well, maybe it was just the clearly closest one.) and is surprised to meet dad in the last cabin. He tells her that he laced the drink and that he has a counter-agent for her so that she feels less shitty. She drinks it, then they exchange expressions of affection. He asks her if all is well and tells her to continue in the way she did so far. So, why did he kinda *poison* his daughter just to get her into that booth? Instead of just telling her to *fake* feeling ill? For no remotely justifying reason. Well, she surprisingly tells him something of value, but he couldn't expect that. On his way out, by the way, he pulls the school's fire alarm, having everyone flee in panic and destroying public and the pupil's property in the tens of thousands of dollars. Oh, did I mention that his wife, actual mother of this very daughter, had been murdered earlier in the movie? What an opportunity to poison the daughter to have some father daughter time on the toilet.](#spoiler)  No paradox, just completely failed writing. But if you don't call at least one of the things I described a plothole, then I can only back away slowly.   So beautiful.   Ah, man. ... *takes a look at [book](https://i.imgur.com/UCpWs18.jpg)* ... No can do.   Huh. Well, thanks for that, because I was actually being serious. Plot hole plugged. I wonder if it was an afterthought or if this was a (secret) fact from the get-go.   Hm. Pro. Motion.   It's probably not so much about "It needs to have meaning!" as rather about the contrast between the theistic view to an atheistic view that those people all of a sudden consider: In their view, there's this heavenly father, wonderful and all that, and he has plans and intentions for mankind, and that seems awesome to those people, the idea makes them happy. Now they consider a world without God: That sugar-coating is all of a sudden gone. Where's the (intent-)meaning? That's what I guess is going on.   Image clearly shows that it wasn't taken with a tripod, so I would guess someone lit fireworks, someone else took a shot with their phone with some long exposure setting, and it was indeed closely to perfect timing: A bit of whizzing around on the floor, then the take-off.   Harry Potter is one big plot hole because returning Harry to that completely insane foster family is something only Satan would do, not someone who even remotely cares about Harry's well-being.     Doesn't work. Sarris supposedly lied a lot ("said one thing, then did another"), and Earth would have had a ship capable of interstellar travel once the Thermians started watching the show.   I thought Greece was the horse, and the warriors that came out at night were the too-big-to-fail arguments.   You're not super-human, you work with the same chemistry like all of us. You have not transformed into a being that can magically enjoy these substances without drawback. The happiness you experience via the substances is not pure, and even if it were a truly desirable form: You're milking happiness out of your system that is later missing in other places. You're borrowing money from the bank that you have to pay back with interest, whether you drop the addiction or not.  Just know this and obey the facts. If you want to be happy, do it the right way.   In a post about air travel even.   "We thought he'd die in a crash in time."

Full quote of the current comment:  ----  []alienthSr. Sysadmin[S] 22 points 3 months ago*   I'm really excited about being part of an extremely talented team which I feel I can learn a lot from. I'm still very new, but that is a big thing which drew me to this job.  In terms of jobs, I seek companies which tend towards being transparent with their users, and also actively avoid annoying / fucking with their users. I can't stand places which see their users solely as a revenue source to be exploited.  Edit three months later: Several places have been linking to this in the context of the recent events at reddit. The comment I left above was in regards to why I chose to join Stack Exchange, not why I left reddit. I parted ways with reddit solely because of the relocation policy.    Well, the whole point of all things the Greek government has done in negotiations seems to be to draw the inevitable out, so it depends on when the EU will wisen up and say stop.  This change of finance-minister is yet another move in the same scheme. "Oh, we have reason to talk to them again now!" Right.   Here's a Guardian article from the 3rd this month claiming that new research suggests a Big Rip:  http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/02/not-with-a-bang-but-with-a-big-rip-how-the-world-will-end  Mentioning "Dr Marcelo Disconzi, the mathematician who led the work at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee".  I just saw [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/EverythingScience/comments/3c6wmd/this_week_in_science/) post ("This Week in Science") in /r/EverythingScience linking to [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/8sJswri/) image and remembered that I had seen OP's post earlier, so I came back to drop this comment.   Don't say "fuck off". You'll never know when you meet the guy with the surprise money suitcase from their Powerball win or because they're an eccentric billionaire. Live-changing moments, every moment.   *Nephew buys shareware CAD software for $20.* "See?"   Same.)   That's also a good tip if a new game doesn't work on Steam, which happens sometimes. Restart Steam, try again. Usually does the trick.   That's also the most likely way artificial general intelligence (AGI) would be invented.   "No, wait. It came back when I moved the mouse.

The lines religious people draw are almost completely arbitrary. The conflict between anti-theism and religion is at least on one side not one of reason but just one of will. Trying to make sense of it is useless, it just supports their untrue claim that there actually is a system, laws, reason. I guess that, without hyperbole, the amount of religious "facts" made up on the spot per day is about 1% that of religious people.  Theistic religious people are the greatest blasphemers and slanderers in the world. They abuse God for their own personal ends. If there will be judgment time, religious people will get the harsher sentences, that is clear. Praised be atheism - the best way to stay out of hell.   What if they come visit you and ask you to cook broccoli? Slippery slope. We have to stop them right nao!   So, you're the guy who came up with something along the lines of "masturbation compared to real sex is like religion compared to actual investigation of reality". I think we could do a similar thing about prayer based on your post text. "masturbation compared to real sex is what prayer is to real action". Hm, sounded better before I had to put it into words.    do I allow my cultural perspective to think it is the only valid one? Or can I have my view yet understand and tolerate others?  I don't know what you're asking me to say. An attempt to give a loosely related answer:  The term used should be fitting the purpose. If the intended meaning is "actual reality", then something along those lines, in whatever language, should be phrased.  If the intention is to talk about an *explanation* for reality (e.g. "God"), then that's a different topic. I think the problem is that some topic-mixing is occurring, making the whole thing more problematic than it needs to be. Even if one assumes that the universe-reality is caused from moment to moment by God, then we could still just look at this like at a video projection: The whole cone of light in the air back to the lens could be called "reality", the causer of this cone would just be a different topic.  I mean, if we're talking about "seeing reality like it really is", then we're generally talking about better and better "maps" of reality in our heads, science being the apparently best tool for creating those. And your TED reference suggests that you're rather talking about *practical* reality, which *at the most* would carry us to the outer borders of science, like e.g. the knowledge of Relativity which had to be built into the GPS system to make it functional, since we as everyday humans do actually use that system, so we could take it that far.  If there's a cut-off point beyond investigation via science will forever remain impossible is not known yet. Currently, an estimation for this would be the singularity that started it all, and in practice it currently seems to be between 10^12 second and 10^6 seconds after the beginning of time, if I read Wikipedia correctly. Like in the temporal direction, there might be other directions (space? logic?) in which science eventually can't look further. But there could still be a reality behind that. For example, there could be God projecting reality from moment to moment, and even with direct information from him about how this works, we could only get so far to the projector's lens, there would have to be a "Brute Facts" cut-off point that can only be accepted but not investigated. At this point, reality would end and its source would be the topic of observation, which wasn't the topic of this and the other post.  So, there are apparently three possible scenarios: 1) All of reality can be understood incl. its ultimate temporal or immediate source. 2) Only reality can be investigated, the source could only be accepted (If we were informed about it.) and can reasonably be assumed to be not part of reality. It would of course be *real*, but maybe it makes sense (Don't know.) to distinguish between that which is caused and the causer. 3) Only reality can be investigated, but if we were informed by e.g. God, we could also investigate or at least understand the process by which reality results from the source, but the source itself would behave like in "2)".  I don't know if these three options are the only ones. Since we're talking about theism, I guess they are the only ones.  I think it would make sense to not mix them up while communicating. I think when you asked, you were using 2 or 3 where there's a reality but also a projector, but you were then arguing as if the projector would be a part of reality instead of something distinct from it.   I didn't vote, but I guess that the downvotes are caused by the second sentence giving the impression as if the comment aims to give justification to the behavior of the "bullies".  This impression of mine plus the fact that the more civilized a society, the less manifested their negative emotions, lead me to suggest that "primitive" would have been the better word.  And don't bend to those who call "racism". Half the time they are just dishonestly trying to swat opposing views, damaging the actual victims of racism and the truth in the process. I mean, you saw where that got you (if I interpret you correctly): Instead of making a clear statement, you had to pervert it out of obedience, causing miscommunication.    That's pretty hard to get totally out of your field of view, especially when you also need to keep the sun and Earth out.  For example, you can't just hold your hands directly at your eyes to force a smaller angle of influx, because your face is a few cm behind a transparent wall (helmet). I guess it would be possible with a bigger object, though.  You can't just bend your head upwards to look at exclusively the "sky" because the helmets are firmly part of the rest of the suit ([photo](http://americanmonsters.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/moon_apollo.jpg)).  You can't just lie on your back to watch the sky like you're lying on the grass in the summer, because an astronaut would not risk the integrity of their breathing apparatus etc. just for a better view.  All in all, I guess they were able to see the stars with some tricks, but this would be so elaborate each time that they almost never saw them. Or were the gold filters immovable? In that case, the stars wouldn't be visible by the human eyes behind these "sunglasses".   Doesn't the [Hohmann transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit) that was mentioned here somewhere else suggest that you can aim just right to end up in a proper orbit? I mean, can't you fire your engines/steering while in a circular high orbit in a way that will make you end up in a circular low orbit without having to use the engines all the way / without using it several times?  Is the intermediary elliptical orbit really the only physical option?    The decision of two is required for peace but only of one to make war. In very different words: You can't make peace with Kim Jong-il, you can only *put up* with him. OP needn't have any responsibility here.   Well, let's say that if any person puts something into a normal fridge (Not laboratory.) that looks edible but isn't, then they put a clear sign with words saying so next to it, at least I think that's the way it should usually be handled.  I think it would be legitimate to add lots of laxatives to half of one's cupcakes in a fridge, put a warning sign next to all cupcakes, and eventually eat the edible ones which are marked in some hidden but inimitable way. (Take care - the places might get switched around by someone.) Roommate won't touch them, you can still eat them. If roommate touches them, they might get the "poisoned" ones, but they can't complain. Or is there a law against this, too?   YouTube comments can be up- and down-voted. No idea what results this has (e.g. auto-hide), but it exists.   I think you should replace "natural" with "primitive".   I am convinced that we as an evolved being experience almost-undoings as a wake-up call. We've been formed, system by system, layer by layer, via the concept of just *killing* us if we weren't good enough. This basically means that the configuration that emerged is one that represents the will not to die. Now a situation happens in which you almost die, or in which you are threatened with being undone.  I am convinced that people who climb to the top of buildings like [this](https://i.imgur.com/YniYetz.jpg) one, or other extreme sports where the so called "adrenaline rush" plays a key role, do that to trigger the above effect. *It wakes them up.* I mean, you normally have to push some button in your head to be more aware, to learn about reality, to look at that bush over there harder, etc. - but using this wake-up call cheat, it's as if you just open like a flower by yourself, you're not *trying* to be more aware, you just *are* more aware. You get a much stronger experience of "I exist!" and of what "reality" means.  Such an experience, I guess, usually instills the knowledge *anew* for some time of what it means to exist as a human, and what reality means, transporting the "will" of the flesh into the conscious mind, allowing *the person* to become more *the being* that they basically are. I guess that such opportunities can also be used to infect the rest of the person's mind with this will and knowledge, e.g. striving more for truthfulness, for protecting themselves from negative influences (e.g. decision to eat better food and also not too much of it), and for caring more about the being of their fellow humans (and animals).   I know what you're saying, but since I found interesting/useful what Matt said a week ago on the Atheist Experience, I'll put it here, too, even though it's slightly off topic. Link to full show (don't know when exactly he said it): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss2glvgtAU8  What he did was: He tried to point out to the audience how irrelevant it is if a single person prays 10 times for a change of weather with apparent effect, or some other statistically significant seeming outcome. And he said he wants to do that one day with an audience.  Say you have an audience of a hundred or so people. Everybody flips their coin. If it comes out heads, they sit down, otherwise they stay standing. Eventually the last person standing will have a sequence of, don't know, 10 or so coin flips in a row that came out exactly the same.   As a meager start, would it be sufficient if it just drives past while you're looking?   I think both are retired.    How can a properties that doesn't exist anywhere in any capacity chemicals emerge from chemicals? Why should I believe that?  You should realize how important and omnipresent the concept of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence is in reality. For example, phase changes of materials, e.g. liquid water turning into water-gas (aka steam (I always have to struggle these days not to capitalize the "s")), happen because of emergence.  The individual molecules don't behave differently all of a sudden. They do what they always do when not at 0 Kelvin: They jitter around in their "force cage" locations, elastically quasi bumping into their peers via forces, or they are even actually moving around. These motions are chaotic: If they were all moving in the same direction, the macroscopic object comprised of these molecules would itself move around. Instead, they move in all kinds of different directions, bounce into the "Don't go here." force and move back or in a different direction, and so forth. That's why it's easy to heat something up, but you can't just add energy to cool it down again: You would have to give the exact counter-force for each individual molecule to stop its motion, but obviously you can't just cast that into a lump of material.  So, you add more thermal energy, and eventually the chaotic motion of the molecules becomes so intense that they fly apart on a large scale. I'm not sure if they actually *don't* fly apart before that already: It might be that e.g. at the surface of water, the effective temperature might be above 100C even though the water body itself is still well below that. Again, I don't know. However, the emergence effect comes in when the chaotic motion of the group is too large to keep the molecule group together, so they start to zip around individually, they have become gas.  Emergence. That concept is in *everything*. Assuming that you haven't really familiarized yourself with the concept and its omnipresence in reality: I think you should do that and rethink your stance on what chemicals can and can't do. Especially, the stance on what we can easily conclude that they can and can't do.    Matter cannot be about other things.  "If I, atom of kind X, find atom of kind Y within reach, I will gladly form a molecule with it." Of course there is no conscious process like this going on. However, this is practically a decision-process, one that could be a lot more complex if the chemical situation is a very different one. Why shouldn't it indeed be a human wondering whether or not to eat another burger? I personally (Not quite the atheist view.) argue that the universe is consciousness-LEGO, so to speak. Consciousness does never arise, instead only self-perception arises. We are the universe experiencing itself subjectively. So, my point here is: The mere material universe can produce people who wonder about it.   It's of course a fact that even the oldest cultures would have a concept of a reality beyond the senses - assuming that the respective humans already reflected upon their own consciousness. Because *every single* learning experience basically represents the disparity between one's inner map of reality and actual reality. So, there is *massive* data in every single person's head clearly saying that the actual reality is beyond the person's concepts of reality.  But the term "reality" (or when it comes down to topics like this, "actual reality") seems sufficient. Whether or not god(s) exists and cause[d|s] reality: All I have written so far does not give any remotely sufficient reason to relabel the "actual reality" as "God".  Btw., I think "Conclusion 2" doesn't follow: For example, what if the universe is consciousness-LEGO? In that case, mere matter and the flow of events would be sufficient to produce consciousness. But this might be an irrelevant objection.   The simulations run in that lab disregard that it wasn't possible yet to create an artificial general intelligence (AGI), that's an AI that could successfully perform any intellectual task a human can perform. So, the experiments could not test how a being, that hypothetically perceives reality a lot more as it is and also has intelligence, would do in a competition.  But we see the result every day: Because we can see reality a lot more as it is than those beetles, we can overcome competitors as a group and by the use and even creation of tools. We have even accidentally killed a lot of species already - talk about top of the food chain.  What was your point? To say that evolution would not make us into what we are because the experiment supposedly shows that we wouldn't be superior? Well, that didn't work, because human-level intelligence can't be simulated yet. Can human-level minus one be simulated? Probably not. Minus two? I guess these answers can't be found until we know how intelligence really works, because before that we can't even properly know what lesser intelligence means. So, we can also not say what role the *potential* for an eventually human-intelligence specie would play in evolution.   :) SCNR: A train with an infinite number of boxcars can have an engine. Imagine you have an infinite universe and put rails across it from left to right. Now you put infinitely many box cars on the rails. Now you cut off half the train and add an engine. Still infinitely many box cars. (But this is just a nitpick.)   No, I'm a German guy whose name must stay unknown until I am safe from the only danger there is: The will of man.   Man. That's a thing that has happened to me several times in the last few days: I tried to make a very clear statement, then someone comes and misunderstands it completely - but only once it has happened I see that this was very likely to happen, so it's not your fault. When I said   I have the exact same name over there.  you read "I have the exact name 'King\_Kunta' on voat.co" (even though that doesn't make much sense after what you said).  But I meant: "My name on voat.co is king\_of\_the\_universe, exactly like it is here."   I have the exact same name over there. Can see the frontpage while logged out but not while logged in: "Voat is under heavy load. Please try again in a few minutes."   Your problem, however, is that I am God, and that means that you have to suck up to me, or I will do nothing to prevent your natural death.   Maybe (he's English after all), though at first glance I don't like this thick lips :P   Yes, that's true. Maker of the universe, and the only thing that stands between 7.2 billion people and natural death.    Your ignorance is no one's problem but your own.  I am *making* it your problem.   WTF, are you an idiot? First of all: This whole "getting defensive" thing that society so loves to throw around is wrong. What's wrong about a person defending themselves? Accusing someone of that sounds completely insane to me.  But what mainly makes me think that you are potentially mentally limited is this: You require science to tell you how you feel about things. I and other non-disfuctional people do know how I/they feel about things. I do not need a study that tells me whether or not my feelings actually exist.  In case you are really this dimwitted, let me give you an example - doesn't require the download of a PDF: If you want to solve a riddle, and I give you the solution - did I spoil the experience of solving the riddle for you, you fucking idiot?   I disagree. We're not talking about mainstream media like popular blockbuster movies to which you can easily assign a spoiler-timeframe. But that's not really important. What's important is that if *you* were told how certain great stories end before you have read them, you would be pissed and would have wished that you didn't read it. That is what I expressed: The wish to not have read this.  I find the recklessness with which OP threw that spoiler at us unnecessary. The string "!SPOILER!" in the middle of the sentence could have saved a lot, and it would have been easy.  I am not convinced by you. You are probably also not convinced by what I just said. If so, let's leave it at that.    No, Taq isn't about to remove this comment because it doesn't contain a personal attack.   Your "acceptance" of the justification isn't really relevant.   You will find out that it is, for my ability to determine truth is above that of everyone else, and you *do* aim to decide truthfully, right? Well, and you will eventually find out that you didn't.  Case in point: Let's see what I said here, which you think is acceptable:    Either you are really just a troll, which is what I believe, or you are funny in the head.  And let's see what I said in my [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/3be6tz/to_all_are_you_an_extremist_if_so_why_do_you_hold/csm82be?context=10) comment which you blocked as violating rule 2:    [referring to the guy I replied to] I like to not waste time with trolls and the like.  The former, which you think is acceptable, is a very direct bullet fired at the person I replied to. It says "you are either troll or mentally sub par".  The latter, which you used your moderator-powers to hide from the public eye, is more focusing on why I abort the discussion (Full comment is: "Ok. 'you try to see a certain view' confirmed. Have a nice day. I turn off responses since you are not willing to communicate. I like to not waste time with trolls and the like."), and it also says "you are either troll or something like it", which is clearly weaker insult-material.  How is the latter significantly more violating rule 2 than the former?  My *guess* is that you are evaluating these with the background of the actual discussion: The guy I replied to *here* is quite obviously trolling or at least showing a clear lack of interest in giving non-offensive and useful responses. However, if that were so, then I have to get back to my original objection to your hiding my other comment: The guy was, just like this OP, not interested in actually communicating, he was just throwing around stuff, and I pointed that out and said that further participation of mine was obviously useless.   I meant to express that I dislike the kind of language you use, because it is removed from truth. I'll turn off replies now, I expect you to be intellectually inferior to most adolescents.   Headline: "Story spoilers don't spoil stories" - Yes they do. I don't care about their angle - their headline is untrue, seems like a clickbate-ish title, like Hawking's "God no longer required"-BS.   Post doesn't strike me as useful. A useless response:  Maybe the reason that something exists at all is that maybe it's part of the true definition of nothing that it can not exist.    "a crusade to destroy Christians and the Christian Church."  If only they were right.   That could have used a spoiler tag. I hadn't read the story yet.   For those who didn't: Fly, you fools!   Every other comment you read henceforth will be of lesser desirability.   **[ALTERED]**: Sped up. Original is 1h38m, video is 1h25m.  Video quality is bearable but could be a lot better for 720.   I wonder if it is altered. The contrast seems increased, and where the colors have been drowned by white or black, they can indeed not be salvaged (tried it). Is that just extreme color grading by the producers, or is the video changed from the movie?   In case you're not being sarcastic: Could you explain to me what you liked about it? Because I don't get it. I found it to be one of the worst, I think even *the* worst.   **[ALTERED]**: "Lens flare". And sped up (WITHOUT time-stretching for a change, just like a record playing too fast).   Are you threatening me, mortal?   It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is.   But there's nothing wrong with that. If what she said are facts, and if the prosecution will only effect punishment that befits what actually took place, then there is just nothing wrong with her talking so openly about it. It's actually appreciated. Hand me the truth right away instead of trying to obfuscate until the end in hopes to effect a lighter sentence than deserved.  I'm just not sure if she was aware of the possible consequences of her statements, but maybe she was. Though that "keep money" part just doesn't compute.   I disagree. Posts are like an official "Everybody, let's debate the following position:" placard, but a much more whimsical (and also not quite debate-focused) discussion can be had in here - there is no replacement for this in this subreddit, especially since the mods stop posters right in their tracks if the post doesn't present a debatable position. Comments are much more loose. These threads *are* useful.  Actually ... why do you object? Are these threads an eyesore for you? Do you not realize that without these posts, many of the comment threads would become additional posts? Or is that your goal, forcing them to either shape their comment up to a post or to stay quiet?   I like to think that prayer is unnecessary and that instead *even our innermost weakest wishes and desires* arrive at God and are fulfilled *immediately*, but since he is doing that *to everybody* without condition, the result is the world we have, because of compatibility (e.g. two objects can't occupy the same spacetime position). And I like to think that this approach eventually leads to the ideal world in which all this is automatically orchestrated in a way that reveals the universe to actually be heaven (with immortality and all that).  For your specific situation, I would hence just advise to try to be the best person you can be. What you *are* has a lot more power than what you toss into your wishes, because you *are* living will.    Every time I ask an anti-theist to show some empirical support for their beliefs, they either just say something along the lines of "fuck off",   Let's look at the first [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/3bpt2x/is_creativity_typical_of_new_age_antitheists/) *you* made, and my response to it.  You: "anti-theism [is] the ideology that engenders white supremacism"  Me: "'People! Look at this person arguing against X! The person is a racist!' Expecting everybody else go to 'A RACIST you say? Where did I put my torch and pitchfork?' Fuck off."  And you're complaining about being mistreated? :) Either you are really just a troll, which is what I believe, or you are funny in the head. Just look at your responses in this thread. You expect to be taken seriously? Then I suggest to make proper posts, possibly even with a new account.  I wonder. Will Taq remove this helpful comment once again because it contains "insults"? Would be the third time this week that he does that to me without a justification that *I* would accept as one.   It's also a bit sped up.   Case in point: Sadly, almost no news article on the Web throws the key facts (when, where, who/what, how, ...) at you in short form right at the beginning, as they should, instead there's a lot of repetition, unnecessary or even unprofessional statements. Probably to a good part because of  news aggregators like Google News, gotta keep some reason there for people to actually visit.   When I had my done, I got on my bike and drove home. Only local anesthesia. It was as painful/painless like almost any other necessary dentist visit. The most cringy moment was when the dentist (He? She? Forgot.) apparently essentially crushed the teeth in place with their pliers, seemed to me like instead of pulling them, they destroyed them and then removed the remains. I didn't ask, I just wanted to leave it behind me.  So, to those who want to do it: It's entirely reasonable to go with local anesthesia. The real pain will come afterwards for a few days, anyway. I am convinced that people rather want their lights out because of the mental experience, not because of the pain.   OP's work is awesome, and I don't mean to compare that to my occasional Photoshop uses at all, but just an idea: Instead of painting almost everything manually, I would have tried to e.g. make a mask for all skin parts (on a new layer), use a simple color and appropriate mix mode - which would have looked awful.  However, then I would have used the fact that the skin has different brightnesses in all places and would have used this to bulk-change the hue and saturation of the color that's plastered all over this. There are Photoshop tricks to work with the HSB or LSB channels. Then I would have worked from there.  Many simpler colorizations here have the same hue over selected areas, so while the brightness changes there the hue doesn't, and it's an obvious sign for (cheap) colorization.   Why is this downvoted, even more than once? The quality is very good (and much better than a post of the movie a few weeks back), plus the "Critical reception" makes the movie seem worth a watch.   Well, what if God survived in the Penguin's belly like Jonah survived in the whale? What if there was enough space in that belly? - God of the gaps.   Second time you remove a comment of mine that was justified. (It's not an insult if it is a statement of fact.) Of course you see it differently. I'm just saying. (And taking notes. Book of life and all that.)   I just tried while logged out: Same behavior, except the parent comment appears as "[deleted]", of course. So, you can verify the bug.      (Title) - Very simple. Let's think: "God had to create logic so that it then exists and can be used/investigated [It's like math. Partly just there, partly a made-up tool.] by us." Assuming that this were true:  This specific requirement for God to do something to achieve something else is itself already in the realm of logic, it's a logical requirement. "Hm. Want to have logic. Guess I have to *create* logic then."  This obviously means that logic was never created. Additionally, this means that "omnipotence" can only refer to things that are logically possible, but theists have accepted that for centuries.   I wonder if they find each other over /r/tifu and try again.   This is illogical. If the plan was to rob the guy, who cares what she thinks of his looks? Or would the drink kick in *that* late?    (too convoluted to explain)  I hope you get well soon.   Don't forget the kay-see-age!   Weird that nobody was confused by all the apple juice on the kitchen floor. And if that guy pisses like he drinks, there would have been liters of piss on the floor, too.   "Are you done? It's time to fuck."  *guy pulls out fleshlight*   I prosthest against humor involving disabled people.   Yes it will.  Let's short-cut this: The both of us agree that I will not make you an immortal human.   I am telling you what the majority is saying, so it is you who is using the word wrong. But believe what you want, which is what you're already doing. I, on the other hand, prefer truth.   I'm offering you an opportunity to escape your stupidity.   I think it's just a "meow".  https://www.reddit.com/r/Eyebleach/comments/3bvjdp/dis_hooman_is_now_mine_someone_pass_me_a_flag/csq48xk?context=3   I already posted this yesterday, but I like the apparent confirmation that such content isn't unfitting the subreddit like one commenter suggested it would be.   I believe that most people's problem isn't a lack of knowledge but a lack of order in their minds. Or brains. When I say "mind", I just mean the whole living consciousness with all its memories/experiences, intentions, etc. - the whole "you" minus the body. And I suspect that there possibly isn't really so much something like "strength of will", but rather "purity of will": If a person uses a "strength of will"-move, they are really just *focusing* on a certain aspect of their will *while ignoring all the contradictory aspects*. They wouldn't have to do that if there were no contradictions in the first place.  And this music of will that is mostly just a cacophony has these impurities and self-contradictions on all scales: The coarse ones that one might easily detect ("I don't want to smoke, but my addiction makes me want to do it at the same time.") and microscopically fine ones whose presence one might not be able to see. Ironically, one's ability to see one's mind with more clarity (allowing to dispel more impurities) requires greater purity. In a way, I am convinced, the mind is just a fantasy that is imagining *itself*. If that were so, then it would be quite clear that the experience of the movie is better if the projector's lens is polished and the audience sober.  When you're in bed in the evening, your mind's activities slowly quiet down, until the volume is beyond a certain threshold, which allows sleep to set in. The mind is still active: Contrary to popular misconception, you are not *unconscious* while asleep, you're just very quietly active, and your mental activities are mostly detached from the body. You're in dreamspace. This is not what science says, but it's my own experience. These things aren't easy to investigate scientifically.  Assuming that indeed your mind's activities grow more and more quiet until you cross the threshold to sleep: What is your mind doing at the time? Well, what is it doing *right now*? It is doing what you want it to do. You are actively using it. But what is it doing when you go to sleep? You are still actively using it, thinking about things that happened during the day etc., remembering a few awkward moments that had already slipped your mind again, but most of the time you're not *intently* thinking: You're not deciding "I want to think about that computer game I want to develop." and then follow up with according thoughts, you're rather riding the stream of thoughts that befit the configuration that your mind has in those many minutes, at the same time probably washing away this configuration, finding silence.  What you could do now is to believe that something like that is really going on, and to decide that instead of just riding that stream down into sleep, you want to watch yourself doing that while it happens.  You have probably heard about lucid dreams: That's when the dreamer is aware that they are dreaming, they can often even change their dream intently instead of being on this rather uncontrolled association-driven roller-coaster ride. I have made the experience that observing my mind's activities until I have crossed the volume threshold into sleep usually results in some form of lucid dreaming. But to get there, you first have to tame the horse.  What I mean by that is as follows: Let's say you are in bed, waiting for sleep and *are observing* your mind's activities. Because of this new behavior, a certain observation you make would cause new thoughts, different ones than would have happened if you were just riding without observing. By looking at your mind quiet down, a beginner would quickly effect the opposite, and the struggle alone not to turn the new thoughts into an analysis would carry you more towards wake-state. But if you do this again and again, you will eventually get used to the kinds of additional/new thoughts that are caused by observing yourself fall asleep. So, instead of a petulant horse, you're back on the calm one you had before, except now you're doing something that would usually rile it up: You're looking at your mind's activities that are not intently caused by yourself.  But who causes those activities? You, of course. It's just activities that you didn't know yet you case. The more conscious you become of those, the more you become the conscious and intent owner of these parts of your own will - you are conquering your subconscious. That process can take *decades*, but useful improvements along the way happen all the time.  Now, imagine the difference between deciding "I do something now." and not deciding it. (E.g. not thinking about a topic that popped up in your head.) What happens when you don't do it? You are *aware* of the topic, but you allow your will that touches that topic to fall silent.  The great success that you can now slowly strive for is that you can master that whole cacophony and slowly turn it more and more into silence. This isn't the absence of will, or brain-washing, or the loss of something. Instead, it's you cleaning up. All that which you have touched and let go of is still there, it's available whenever your will calls for it. But what it is not any more: Out of control. Controlling you instead of serving you. You can be sure that, for example, people who are more a master of their mind can overcome addictions better than others, because they can unlock this "foreign" will of the cigarette in their brains and make it their own will, and then they turn it off.   You are right and wrong at the same time, and I completely disagree with your vote score. This post is worth discussing.  For the longest time I have suspected the same thing, but lately I have come to appreciate the strong emotional push that is supplied by beautifully crafted and painted game realities.  It's true that the more empty the page, the more room is there for your imagination. Undeniable hard proof of this: Books. Playing a game that e.g. doesn't use much (or any) textures has a stronger otherworldly feel to it than even the most alien but well-textured game, because the latter still says "Natural reality." while the former is by all standards unnatural. Hence the emotions evoked are different and possibly stronger ones. On the other hand, the voice with which the game expresses how its reality works, what cause effect network is at play, is much quieter in less graphically developed games, so the part in your imagination where these meanings gather aren't bombarded with strong statements, there is just insinuation going on, triggering you to fill the gaps yourself. A very extreme example of graphically primitive games in which I personally was able to experience rich emotional content: (free PC implementation of) Mercenary etc. - http://mercenarysite.free.fr/mddclone.htm  Contrary to the above which I thought about often in recent years with better graphics, I have learned to see the benefits of those: If we're just talking landscape (grass etc.), for example, then this is a topic where the imagination of the majority might have made very similar choices except with weaker strength in comparison to what the fully shaped and textured world causes in their heads. *Other* areas of the game could be less explicit, so the player's imagination could be more playful and active, building on the strong emotional fundament of the landscape. But if a game is more elaborate, it usually is so in most of its areas, incl. the texts being spoken by proper actors, so the described scenario happens rarely, or if so, the areas where the player can fill in imagination are few, and maybe this causes them to be less triggered to fill anything in in the first place.  In a way, the difference is really between reading a book and watching a movie. Both have their advantages over the other, and the book guys could certainly call the movie guys lazy and their experience less rich. What their experience otherwise probably is, though is *more intense*.  One thing that's unquestionably objectively true about better modeled and painted game worlds: They contain a lesser *percentage* of interactive objects. Prime example: Doors. Nowadays, it has become *normal* that when you first play a game, you more or less consciously go through the process of learning which style of doors is intended to be purely decorative and which style is interactive (aka gameplay-relevant). Doors are only an example. Just play Deus Ex: Human Revolution and wonder about the interesting decorative but completely not interactive objects placed everywhere. It's like standing in front of a candy store's window as a kid with no money.  It's of course understandable that this is so, but it *is* a negative. Experienced Desktop Publishingers (like me :P) who learn e.g. about layout and typography know that the brain, when in a new "room" (e.g. in a new game), tries to find patterns, and there's a lot of subconscious stuff going on, one that Typographers know needs to be considered even if the person doesn't ever know consciously what it was that made a certain advertisement less attractive to them (e.g. wrong letter spacing, ill-chosen white space on the page, too many fonts, too long text lines).  With this in mind: Realize that if a game world communicates "most of the stuff here is only decorative, and it is now *your work* to distinguish between interactive objects and pure fluff", it breaks the fourth wall, burdens the player unnecessarily, and makes the world unrealistic. Compare that to a less designed world like the procedurally generated ones in Minecraft: Every object you see counts. Most are unimportant because there are so many of them, and there are so many types you personally might not care about (sandstones, flowers, ...), but nothing is facade, everything is real. A dirt block isn't just there to tell a story, it is a block of dirt, and every single one works as your intuition expects it should: The world is real.  I had more on our pattern recognition and the value you see when knowing that every object is somewhat real, that there is no fluff, but I can't concentrate at work right now.   What's not to get about methods? You want the computer to do something, so you call a method. The method doesn't exist yet, so you have to write it. You have to define the access rights (public etc., and whether or not it's static), optionally a return type, optionally parameters.  I've read this guy's tutorial on concurrency a few times and assume that he in general explains things well.  Link for methods: http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java/methods.html  Link for the language in general (in many chapters): http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java/index.html  Link to all their tutorials: http://tutorials.jenkov.com/  Have you read any book(s) about Java so far? The course might just suck, or they might just somehow explain in a way that's incompatible with you.  Just for perspective: http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/java/  A proficient programmer would be able to do a lot just by studying that.   Logic, mate.  The set "Santa Claus" only contains topics like "Christmas presents", "flying deer", and "north pole". While those technically could call one's whole understanding of the world into question, that's rather a weak fringe effect.  The set "Young Earth Creationism" contains "Evolution" and "science". Believing YEC requires one to be severely impaired regarding one's understanding of *reality*. Ironically, our key advantage over other species is that we understand reality better and can hence make better decisions and tools. Convincing people that they are not evolved beings kind of practically devolves them.  The difference is like between "troll-pushing the wrong elevator button so that the passenger has to take a small detour" and "triggering the elevator's emergency brakes so that the passenger can't get anywhere for a long time".   I am God. This is judgement time. Consider your attitude, child, or I will not let you through the portal.   I don't drink now.  And now is all I could ever experience, there *is* only this moment.   Well, I just looked at about a thousand `muslim protest` images via Google Image, and indeed none had both views expressed simultaneously.   In case you mean the Islam pics: Yes, they are a parody, but what's actually real: On the one hand: "religion of peace" On the other hand demonstrations with placards like "freedom of speech burn in Hell". *Those* are real!   It's perfectly in line with their FIFA movie description. In case you don't know about this movie, you're in for a treat (in the forums, the movie supposedly sucks):  https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/391z8s/fifas_29_million_feature_film_has_607_boxoffice/cs0bwxa?context=100  Yes, it's real. Completely unbelievable, right. And now this statement by Blatter? Someone call a doctor of the mind.      /r/shittytumblrgifs   I personally dig programming a lot, been doing it for decades, but I'm absolutely not good at math. Though I think the reason snobocracy asked this is: Do you like *abstractions*? With that, I mean: Do you like to find answers that encompass several problems/questions at once? This mental muscle to climb higher on the ladder of abstractions is highly required for programming.  Because you want to *achieve more with less code*, one of the many reasons being that *structuring* the code optimally for the respective project (and also respective programmer - the person's mind does play a role in this, it's not all about objective rights and wrongs) is a key part of the work, and the more unnecessary quasi-redundant baggage you have to fight with, the harder this becomes.  Abstraction is really important. It's kinda like this: You have to be able to stick a label on a box that really fittingly describes its content, and the more the box can contain while you're still able to do so, the better.   They should toke them up on the offering.   I am being misunderstood.   I wish people wouldn't by default downvote stuff like this all over the site. You're not making a stupid audience-spite comment etc., you're presenting an argued opinion. Are you right or wrong? Your opinion is *unpopular*, that's all I learned.  For example: I do not follow TS at all, don't listen to her (or anyone's - it's only SomaFM's DroneZone every day for years now; yes I'm weird) music, I merely subscribed here like to many other subreddits. So I know almost nothing about TS and would have appreciated if this had unfolded to a proper discussion, giving me actual information about her from two opposing sides, which usually results in a higher quality sumtotal opinion. But no, this is the Internet, and might makes right.   I guess it's possible for her to look bad, but I also guess that it requires an effort on her part.   Maybe we could compromise: A quick edit of the stylesheets for the submission page plus tweaks to the automoderator could be used to *enforce* that for the time being, every submission title must start with a certain text. This would quickly become an ratheism-frontpage-wide strong visual effect, would also suggest solidarity via every single post (This would be a *bit* untrue, though. On the other hand, those who don't agree could abstain from posting during this time.)  The text could be a super compressed information or keyword bomb and/or could just refer to the top of the sidebar (which would also have to be edited). It could also be in allcaps, for greater visual distinguishment from the rest of the title, which is usually mixed-case. The prefix text could also start and end with something like "#### " " ####" to stand out and separate more.  This would mix "the subreddit submitting itself entirely to the cause" with "staying up at the same time".   /r/DebateReligion  is set to private and links to an explanation with lots of details.   How about  \################ Thursday Rabble, why not? ################   As a theist but fervent religion-hater, I would say "See? It doesn't make any sense!", but people are making a mistake all the time when they make assumptions about God, so that's what I focus on:  "Omnipotence" has, for the longest time (Centuries.) been accepted to refer to "only that which is logically possible". If we assume this kind of omnipotence, then we must submit to the realization that we don't know the true situation God was in when he decided for Creation, we don't even know the true situation right now. So, "why would God ..." and "why didn't he" can't be answered. We can have interesting speculative discussions, but the fact is that we can not find a meaningful answer which we henceforth work with.   Well, I wonder if what [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyrobots/comments/3bqwuo/news_of_noon_today_in_germany_robot_kills_22yo/csp2nw0?context=10) commenter said is true.   Is this a scientifically correct answer or guessing? The grating is made of metal, the hemisphere is filled with water.   It is! :D   Imho let's give them a chance - who knows how representative the current slowness is. Here's an example page for people who want to know what format this thing has:  https://www.minds.com/archive/view/458501246215528448  https://www.minds.com/blog/view/100000000000244884/when-cocktails-meet-science  Found via the search - they were smart enough to keep this URL compatible:  https://www.minds.com/search?q=science q_= search_type=all  Personally, I don't like the format, so count me out.   Wonder what the differences are (other than lower resolution) to this very recent post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/fullmoviesonyoutube/comments/3bt20i/star_wars_the_phantom_edit_2015_1080p_it_is_a_fan/  Possibly that it is *actually* the Phantom Edit, at least [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fullmoviesonyoutube/comments/3bt20i/star_wars_the_phantom_edit_2015_1080p_it_is_a_fan/cspko9d?context=10) comment said that the other post wasn't it.   What, is it a loop?  ^^^^^;)   Or under-appreciated. Time will tell.   Could you set the flair for this post? I assume "Abrahamic" is what you mean.  	138
 I'm getting more confused here. I didn't write what you're quoting. I was simply confused about why editing a post on Reddit means a person on gets down-voted.   I remember a lot of that being him trying to compromise and watering it down in order to get it passed by a bipartisan vote and then getting zero Republicans to vote for it anyway.  	2
 http://www.amazon.co.uk/Propa-Propaganda-Benjamin-Zephaniah/dp/1852243724      Bemused pug adds another nicely bizarre touch.       O      |      n                  It's [Dylan Shumaker](https://www.google.com/search?q=Dylan+Schumaker safe=off es_sm=122 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=npwDVLaoA8i70QXZvICADw ved=0CAoQ_AUoAw biw=1242 bih=604).   What do you mean by 'they can see polarized light'?        Like I'm looking at an unfinished piece of artwork and that the artist should have coloured it in.   This would look different if it was - 'Where American oil companies get their oil from'.   Very useful. Some stuff on there I'd not come across before - or certainly not in such a succinct form.  Inevitably things get lost in translation however. I like the Pali and Sanskrit words for the brahma-viharas. Particularly *mudita*. Not a word we have a direct equivalent to in English. I'd translate it as 'experiencing happiness in the happiness of others'. A lot of the Sanskrit and Pali origins are well worth checking out further.  Seeing the delight of others in this cheat sheet is a good opportunity to bask in some mudita, mind. :)    Buddhism has helped me a lot in the past few years. I recommend finding a teacher and/or sangha too. I've found that to be highly conducive to keeping one engaged not only in Buddhism but life in general. [This - the World Buddhist Directory - might be of use.](http://www.buddhanet.info/wbd/)   Money is involved in a lot of loan deals nowadays.

Sayers, a committed Anglican, wrote a cycle of plays about Jesus, 'The Man Born to be King', which the BBC broadcast in the 1940s. There was outrage. Heres the Lords Day Observance Society, whose formal complaint to the BBC spoke  believe it or not  for many conservative Christians:  Christian people have been shocked at the announcement of the proposed impersonation of our Lord Jesus Christ in a Sunday Play on the wireless . . . the first time a radio impersonation of Christ has been attempted anywhere in the world . . . bordering on the blasphemous . . . a contemplated violation of the Third Commandment which forbids taking the Name of God in vain.  That was little more than 70 years ago. Today we would struggle to understand how there could even have been an issue. Listen now and the only thing that might surprise you is how posh theyve made Jesus: He sounds like a Conservative MP.  -------------------  Matthew Parris writing in The Times (27/08/14).   *Speak softly and carry a big stick.*  Sometimes violence is just. Remember violence can exist in body, speech, and mind. I'd aver that Buddhista's phrase 'taking him apart' is violent.  Infinite shades. Infinite shades.

I think it could be understood to have a metaphysical as well as an ethical dimension. The Dharma should be its own reward. You don't follow the Dharma to receive something other than the Dharma; you act according to the Dharma and consequently it is the Dharma you receive.   A banana trader would expect to receive, say, money for his bananas. A devotee of the Buddha who expects to trade the Dharma for money in a similar fashion would be acting wrong-headedly.   http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/road-and-rail-transport/11043893/Rail-fare-hike-Britain-vs-rest-of-Europe.html          One should not make an effort everywhere,       should not be another's hireling,       should not live dependent on another,       should not go about        as a trader in the Dhamma.

The saying evokes passing someone on a flight of stairs and wanting to have said something but only thinking of it a few moments too late as, say, you have gone up and they have gone down. One only realises the best thing to say after more time spent thinking (conscious rumination or subconscious gestation). I was punning on 'stairs'. Both stairs, and 'reflection and doing nothing' elevate one.  Edit: I remember now that the pun worked on another level too: *l'espirit d'escalier* is the key to going deeper. Typical *l'esprit d'escalier* - remembering to add this now!   I know that's how it's used. I was deliberately being more expansive.      *L'esperit d'escalier* is the key to going up in the world.

Specifically referring to allegations of torture:  **The Winter Soldier Investigation**  In Detroit in 1971, several soldiers described incidents of torture, though they refused to name the soldiers who had tortured.^51 ... They gave their own names and presented their discharge papers, identifying when and where they had served, and they detailed when and where torture occurred. The soldiers at Winter Soldier did not describe bizarre tortures never reported elsewhere, as in other accounts, and at least as far as torture is concerned, there is nothing here to make one question Senator Mark Hatfields decision to read this account into the Congressional Record in 1971....  Steve Noetzel offers the earliest account of American telephone torture, situating it in the Mekong Delta region between 1963 and 1964.^52 Soldiers who served in the mid-1960s repeatedly mention telephone torture and less commonly beating. There are two accounts describing the use of dogs in torture and singular accounts of suspension, water torture, and ear boring.^53 One soldier describes an incident of field interrogation using knives in which the prisoner was killed because the medics would have become suspicious.^54  Don Dzagulones, a former military interrogator, gave the most detailed account of interrogation and torture. Dzagulones described field telephone torture as well as dehydration, which left nothing that was traceable.^55 As in other testimonials, Dzagulones does not mention official training for torture. Rather, he describes how commanders in Vietnam exercised benign neglect (If people did find out about it, they just let it go, because it was an accepted practice). He also describes how he learned techniques... after the official instructors turned the class over to Vietnam veterans (invariably the instruction would turn to various methods that theyd seen or heard or used in torturing people in Vietnam).^56 ...  Let me turn now to the criticisms of Winter Soldier. Guenter Lewy has sharply questioned the accounts soldiers provided. In particular, he sharply criticized the unwillingness of soldiers to name those who committed war crimes, arguing that in American jurisprudence, guilt is always personal. Lewy also summarized the results of the investigation of the Winter Soldier allegations by the Naval Investigative Service. The most damaging finding consisted of the sworn statements of several veterans, corroborated by witnesses, that they had in fact not attended the hearing in Detroit. One of them had never been in Detroit all his life. He did not know, he stated, who might have used his name. The report also identifies another soldier, an African-American, who asserted that a member of the Nation of Islam helped him prepare his testimony.^59  But the appearance of exactitude here is deceptive. Unlike other critics, such as Sheehan and Moyar, who have exposed fabricators by name using unclassified military files, Lewy does not give the names of the fake speakers at Winter Soldier, and guilt, as he so correctly states, is an individual matter. Collective sin belongs to theology, not history, and it is a mistake to tar everyone at Winter Soldier with the faults of specific individuals. In 2004, Lewy was no longer certain whether he saw the file that described these allegations. In an interview with the Baltimore Sun, Lewy states that he does not recall if he saw a copy of the naval investigative report or was briefed on its contents.^60 The cursory bibliographic information, which offers neither the date of the investigation nor a reference number, suggests he never saw it.   Efforts to find this file have thus far failed. The Suns reporters were not able to secure it, and Paul ODonnell, the spokesman for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, reported that they were searching for a copy of the report. ^61 In addition, a military librarian with access to classified databases was unable to find the file listed in any database. Perhaps one day a FOIA request will recover this file and two other files Lewy cites.  The lack of names, the probable oral character of the summary, and the absence of the hard copy raise troubling questions about Lewys allegations. Furthermore, during the 2004 presidential campaign, conservative groups put a great deal of energy into finding anyone who would discredit the Winter Soldier investigations. If, as Lewy insists, there were veterans who were outraged that someone used their name falsely to make claims of atrocities in Vietnam, this was the time for them to have come forward. But by the end of fall 2004, only one soldier came forward, Steven J. Pitkin.^62 If Pitkins account is true, it does not fit the allegations in the NIS file. Pitkin does not state someone impersonated him at Winter Soldier; rather he retracts the account he offered there. So where were the several soldiers whose were so outrageously impersonated at Winter Soldier? And where was the African American who had received help from the Nation of Islam in preparing his testimony?   There are also troubling questions about the Pitkin affidavit. Pitkin apparently filed his affidavit twice. His first affidavit was filed on August 31, 2004, and it was immediately contested. Another veteran, Scott Camil, filed his own affidavit on September 11, 2004, pointing to falsehoods in the Pitkin affidavit.^63 Pitkin subsequently filed a new affidavit on September 15, 2004. This new affidavit was surprising in its own right since his close friend from the 1970s, Nancy Miller Saunders, believed he was dead.^64 At any rate, Pitkins new affidavit states that he falsely described incidents of rape, brutality, atrocities and racism at the urging of presidential candidate John Kerry.^65 This is problematic for another reason: Pitkins statement at Winter Soldier does not describe incidents of rape, brutality, or other atrocities. Pitkin speaks thrice in the transcripts of Winter Soldier. The first and longest testimony is a generic statement about the dehumanization caused by war. Here, Pitkin uses the word atrocity to describe U.S. press coverage and his army training stateside, but not to describe specific incidents of violence in Vietnam...   One last fact raises questions about the political motivation behind the affidavit. Pitkin is the easiest veteran to associate with John Kerry at Winter Soldier because he is the only one to appear with him on film. It is thought provoking that given all the soldiers Lewy claims were impersonated at Winter Soldier, only and especially Pitkin came forward to denounce it.   At the moment, then, Pitkins affidavit seems unreliable and Lewys claims about Winter Soldier are as nearly hearsay as the ones he is criticizing. Recently, a group of anti-Kerry veterans have received and made available some 21,477 pages of FBI documents on the Vietnam Veterans Against the War.^67 Perhaps in time, the lost file or FBI files similar to it will appear, allowing one to identify the liars. But the continued absence of the Naval Investigative File suggests that Lewys contact deliberately misled him and Lewy mistakenly found the contact convincing.   Two other features of Lewys discussion of torture are also troubling, suggesting that his assessment of American torture in Vietnam is less than evenhanded. Despite his criticism of testimonials about American torture in South Vietnam, Lewy is quick to accept testimonial literature when it pertains to Communist torture. Unable to show North Vietnamese government documents authorizing torture, he argues nevertheless that the uniformity in the testimonial literature suggests that torture was government policy. Lewy faults gullible antiwar criticism, arguing that they should have known the North Vietnamese would torture given past testimonials about Communist practice during the Korean and Franco-Vietnamese wars.^68  This is the standard application of the Nuremberg rule of course: uniformity of practice indicates uniformity of intent. Indeed, there are important continuities in Communist torture practices, although the testimonial literature also indicates significant variations during the Vietnamese and Korean conflicts, as I document in chapters 3 and 17. Lewy is right to criticize the antiwar critics on this point. By the same token, however, the French tortured in Vietnam as did the South Vietnamese, and the uniform pattern for the latter also strongly suggested that the South Vietnamese had an official torture policy too. Lewy mentions South Vietnamese torture in one sentence, stating only that the ARVN was known for their bad treatment and torture of captured VC. Lewy does not even mention French torture during the Vietnamese conflict.^69  It seems odd that Lewy applies one set of rules for acceptable evidence and interpretation for Communist torture and quite another for American torture. Lewy is correct that retrospective testimony about the past is highly problematic, but so too is proximate testimony. Proximity to the incident may occlude judgment and perspective, and the real situation may become more apparent with time. General Massu believed that torture was effective and necessary at the time he acted in Algeria, but came, correctly, to the opposite conclusion thirty years later. Does this mean his later testimony is false or unreliable? Again, it is rather surprising that Lewy does not even mention this possibility, seeking to rule out all retrospective testimonial literature in principle when it comes to American veterans testimonies of torture.^70 ...   Ultimately though, the testimonial evidence does not disagree too much with the position Lewy wants to defend, namely, that torture was not official government policy issued from Washington, DC. The testimonial evidence describes instead a local, semiofficial policy that existed for all the reasons Lewy outlines.  ________________  From *Torture and Democracy* (2007) by Darius Rejali   I googled a name at random off that CID document. He still upheld his testimony in an interview in 2010.   More convincingly, the book *Torture and Democracy* by Darius Rejali contains the following passage in the Appendix - 'A Note on Sources for American Torture during the Vietnam War':  Furthermore, during the 2004 presidential campaign, conservative groups put a great deal of energy into finding anyone who would discredit the Winter Soldier investigations.

Such a cheese champ, doesn't bring much utility to the game, safe as fuck always, and usually picked by the most self-righteous players.   I found Leeroy!   This is exactly how children and violent media work. So many misinformed people link media to "violent" children, but nearly every time its a kid recreating what he saw.  I can't remember a summer growing up we didn't play war with water guns made for that purpose.   20 yo checking in. Not only is it mandatory, but so is every vocal part. And solos, most definitely can not forget the solos.   As someone who reacts terribly to cheese curds, shredded will do just fine.   My mother and I get into fights like this all the time. I just have a very basic tolerance for stupidity.  I was around her house one time, and she asked me to make space for her to make coffee in the morning. No big deal. I empty a sink and wipe down part of the counter. Well apparently making a pot of coffee involves mopping the floor and 20 feet of uncluttered counter space. Queue heated argument.   I'm sorry, but growing up and this game on air for the next I didn't know how long (I was about 5) I couldn't get into the storyline. Whenever I saw that show dominating the cartoon channels I pretty much didn't watch tv because there wasn't really any alternatives.  Might have been well animated, but I still hate that show.   I come from a well off family and neighbourhood, but I have no desire to lock myself into a massive mortage for a house I don't want in suburbs i despise.  Downtown living is where its at.   Was watching bro and his friends playing, I think one of them had that skin, the way he played.  He also couldn't combo the charge, which I mastered by Dirt IV rank.   Fucking Becky..   Don't you dare drag Us into it.   My senior year thesis-style essay was written about this and how remotely separate the two subjects are. IIRC the overlap of gamers and reported violence (either school or criminal records) is about 0.03% according to the average of my sources. Its pretty minimal.  In my section where I played devil's advocate, I allowed for some grey area where children play a game and then reenact it. This doesn't happen with just violent video games though. Ever since the begining of time children have copied what they see in the world. My great grandfather was a farmer, so my grandfather played with toy tractors. My grandpa was military and big into war history and movies, so my dad played soldier and had toy tanks.  Those extremist parents blaming games for violence, I think, are unable to distinguish reenacting and acting out violently as separate subjects.   The average Starbucks "patron" doesn't order coffee, just coffee-flavoured liquid sugar and foam with more sugar and shit on top.   Had an exam and right after was a course evaluation. Of course theres a box to rate how expressively enthusiastic you are about your work.   Im probably the least outwardly expressive type there is...   Circumcision. Bam, no problems.   I turn food, drink, and time into a massive reddit browsing history.   The main reason four ways are still a thing is because they're cheap and drivers can be idiots to change.  My city added a few of them in recent years, and have they ever cleaned up some congestion. They're just small, single lane ones but it noticeably helps.  This year a proposal was made to convert the busiest intersection downtown into a roundabout. I support the idea, if the average driver in my city had an IQ over 4.   Back in high school, a friend of mine in graphical arts went around the building and violated EVERY mouse he could find by taping over the infrared sensor a little printed troll-face meme guy.  Sat back and watched people slowly lose their minds until checking the sensor...    Spielberg based the storming of Omaha beach off of tactics reported from the success of Juno beach.  Regardless, every beach had it rough. Whenever asked about it, my late great grandfather would only say "lot of good men died," while walking away.   But... why? Whats wrong with a whisk?   I use my ratios as I am professionally trained to.   Now pass the nachos   One batch of hollandaise is just 3 eggs, a little fine diced onion, vinegar, lemon juice, Worcestershire drops, tabasco, cayenne pepper, and 3-4 oz of clarified butter. A splash of water to thin it out.  Granted im a cook, but having a recipe card is unnecessary.  Last note, 99% of restaurants use powder mix because its easy to get health violations with essentially undercooked egg sauce.   "Sir, order something or get out please."   I don't. I had instructors that pushed classical while throwing theory out the window. I've learned more from Super Quest videos on Youtube.   Math checks out.   Honestly, most people who don't have training are too scared to try because they might break ribs. Which happens sometimes, regardless of training.   Or Canada   As an individual with arachnophobia, I want to slug someone every time they link shit about spiders on facebook (who the hell still uses facebook, I know, its just something to idle on at the bus stop). Because its not just a "check out this weird looking thing" its a big HD image of some hairy spawn of Satan.   I've done enough online bill payments and shopping to have my card number, authorization number, and expiry date memorized.   It feels like Zilean is one of those underrated supports that quietly dominates when left unchecked.   Summoners that never made perfect support plays would say that.  Bought Zilian, first game played I combo'd perfectly, so satisfying.  Slowed enemy carry, reset and sped my carry, carry nearly dies- but wait there's more! Ult and bam, carry is back. Dead enemy carry, turret and inhibitor downed.   The older he got, the more cynical his material. I love it!  When Netflix put some of his specials on, binged it all in a night.   I enjoy how Garrisons are blended into the questline so it doesn't feel grindy yet.  As for farming, I've always been excellent at it, so I could have hundreds of potions and dozens of flasks in an hour or two. But I know the feeling, especially dailies. Dailies made me leave MoP for a year and a half.   I managed to get an hour of playtime in Draenor after an hour long queue before the servers crashed.  So far, satisfying.  Garrisons are kinda cool, and one of few areas that currently don't have all the new expansion latency.   Where some people like a thigh gap, I like it filled in just right. Huge turn on for me.   Most football players tend to be large guys, and sports makes people sweaty. Nothing but facts here.   Woah insults uncalled for, which btw I'm 5'11" and a healthy 190 lbs   An attractive feature that sold me is the ball joints (or sliding locks) attaching the speakers to the handband. So many expensive heatsets use cheap plastic swivel hinges that break within a couple months.   Not sure if joke or pun (I am familiar with the commercial).   Are you;  A. Still dating her?  B. Wearing pants?  Good luck if you answered both no!   I completely agree. I go to the city college, and while we might be immature at times (helps with stress in the kitchens), we at least dress in good jeans, sweaters, button downs, dresses and skirts.  	48
 Hi /r/Physics! What are the best introductory texts for learning Lagrangian mechanics? Having taken both the first and second semester introductory physics courses I learned only your typical Newtonian mechanics. As a newer reddit user I continue to see references of the use of Lagrangians and Lagrangian mechanics and find it both interesting and seemingly necessary to understand them. What are your favorite texts that really taught you Lagrangian mechanics? I'm aware of Leonard Susskind's The Theoretical Minimum for classical mechanics and will most likely utilize these too. Thanks!     	2
 Yes.. Your muscles retain memory. Known as "muscle memory" I recommend easing your body back in to a routine.. But you will notice increased ability (ie strength, endurance etc) in all areas at a much rapid pace. Take your time and focus on form.   I'm going to keep things simple and say this with an absolute guarantee... Yes you can... Also congratulations on your weight loss success!           	5
                            It is fairly wordy.   I've been using the Out Of Many AP 5th Edition book and it is not that bad. Why the hate?      I have this question as well, given that I am planning on majoring in this field. I feel as if there is still a surplus because of the countless start-ups and new positions created at large companies. I've never heard of any shortage but then again, I don't have much experience in the field.       Oh, I did not see that. Interesting...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                	105
                                                                                        First post I've seen where I upvoted most of the comments.  The extent of the sexism is not only dismaying/enraging but as old as I am it's really weird and not really understandable.  And I don't even see any jailbait, creepshots, or gonewild.  TwoX is mostly respectful and thoughtful.  And I'm sometimes blown away by the quality of bestof posts and comments in cogsci, science2, foodforthought and others so I keep coming back.                                                                              So many great and thoughtful replies -- thanks.      So how should ethical treason be treated?  And what about those who applied treasonous ethics to justify their treatment of him?               From the article: 51.4 percent of conservative Republicans think we're spending too little on either Social Security, health care or both. Only 28.7 percent think we're spending too much, and just 7.3 percent think we're spending too much on both.  That's 7.3 percent of conservative Republicans in support of the position taken by leaders of both political parties.  It's encouraging to see that the leaders are so wildly off base.                  Okay, without "Americans":  It looks lazy and weird to we.  vs.  It looks lazy and weird to us.  It makes a difference whether it's used as subject or object.   You think *to we* is an improvement on *to us*?  Better not to admit it.               What are the origins of the misuse of the -eez plurals other than pretension?  Once they become widespread people simply copy them, but what gets them started?    The reason I blame pretension is probably because I first heard these -eez plurals thrown around when I started college.  Plurals of thesis, basis and the like were in frequent use and it seemed many students were consciously trying to get them right.   And maybe the reason some words are immune, such as recess, is that there's no status gain to be had.  Or have you ever heard ree-sehs-eez?         The five myths, plus "the greatest myth": The poorest 40 percent own about 10% of the wealth.  Entitlements are the problem. Welfare benefits are a drag on the economy. The American Dream is still alive -- if you just work hard. Prison puts away the bad guys. The rich are being "soaked."   And further: As you stand in the gap between reality and possibility, the temptation is to jump onto one side or the other. If you jump onto the side of too much hard reality, you can get stuck in corrosive cynicism. If you jump onto the side of too much possibility, you can get caught up in irrelevant idealism. These two extremes sound very different, but they have the same impact on us: both take us out of the gap  and the gap is where all the action is.    Also from the aticle: The brains weakest function is the retention of isolated bits of data. Its strongest function is the retention of pattern, narrative, story, and system.  Dumping data bits into students heads and calling it education Is a system that targets the brains _weakest_ function,          Also from the article: When you throw facts at people to refute what they believe, it only hardens their convictions. But if you create a relational container that can hold an ongoing dialogue, its more likely that someone will change  and that someone may be you!         also from the article: Violence is what happens when we dont know what else to do with our suffering. That applies on every level of life. When individuals dont know what to do with their suffering, they do violence to others or themselves.  When nations dont know what to do with their suffering, they go to war.                Emma Goldman: If voting changed anything, itd be illegal.            Then the garden path goes away too.            For me the single.most.obvious.requirement would be open-source code. Nefarious code could alter the paper trail at a level that would be unlikely to trigger a recount.  Paper trails are an obvious requirement though.      Some fraction of a percent comes from [Persian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_Persian_origin).         I am astounded by the wide acceptance here of "free will" as an either/or matter.      1. Cutting the deficit is no big deal. 2. Tackling Climate Change would create jobs and stimulate the economy. 3. Regulations are good for the economy. 4. Occupying foreign countries to prevent terrorism causes terrorism. 5. Government is an essential partner in creating jobs and prosperity.   Thanks.  For a while I thought I had missed an enormous jump.   My brokerage program is Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation.

Reasonable people from both sides cannot come together and hash out a compromise that takes everyones interests into account. The middle ground is an unbridgeable chasm, and ideology represents our attempts to paper over and ignore that chasm.

No.  Did I ever say I am ignoring WWE's blunders? No.  So stop putting words in my mouth.  I was responding to why people are not fans of TNA.  I know WWE fucks up a lot and I don't like that either.   Not everyone, but a good proportion.  Most likely because they are poorly managed and squander every opportunity that they get.  They hire too many old guns from WWE and instantly make them the focal point instead of making new talent shine.  They have just made too many blunders when they could have easily done much better.

I just hate that they have to pair her with Ziggler.  It's the same thing that happens everytime, they have a female wrestler/manager and they put her with Ziggler when they want them to get liked or whatever.  It just seems that that is all Ziggler is good for anymore to WWE is guy to put divas with.   Look I like some of the dumb things in wrestling... but this is just stupid   And fans get mad when people say wrestling is fake lol   So if I get what you're saying, you think that by moving to some cheap reddit knockoff that all the drama will somehow stop?   So the fact that Rollins has won MITB, was given the title at Mania (1st time ever btw), paired with the biggest heel stable in the company, has held the title since Mania, and has been in the main event storylines means that Reigns is getting pushed more than him?

"In the days following 9/11 of 2001, when the rest of the world was transfixed by the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, the Israeli government under Ariel Sharon seized the chance to send tanks into the West Bank, and attack helicopters into Gaza."

You might as well not waste time making them unlockable.... Atleast if it will take THAT many kills... There aren't even 100,000 people playing this shit show.   Spigot will give you a performance boost, but it won't be something crazy. Using flatfiles is generally better than sql databases, and you get better performance with them.  Performance is hugely based on the way your plugins are coded. If you have anything custom coded by an inexperienced deceloper, that may be your biggest performance hit.    Take some time to read through the stickied posts. They have a lot of information.  If you have any specific questions, please ask   Aod? They can kill in a 1v1?   Would love to 1v1 you some time :)   Well then... locking have failed miserably... coyotes for example are 1k certs, but obviously any new player can afford those...  New players don't learn shit from lockons, and when aces use them, we shit on every newbie pilot either way.  All lockons should simply be removed from the game. That's it... removed :O     Yup u are a brain dead moron. Unless you play on Briggs your shitty little PPA esf will get destroyed in seconds by any competent pilot, or you will get shut down by 1 flak source.   The lib was never buffed? Unless you call adding a few shitty weapons no one used anyways a buff...   I don't understand how the SOE dev team works.... When the majority of pilots complain about something being broken, like a2a missles, or coyotes, nothing happens, yet when a minority or majority of ignorant infantry complain about something like the banshee, it is immediately nerfed?  The air game has been shit forever.... The constant gank squads of 4-5 ESFs running lockons ruins the experience, not to mention the fact that AA can kill an ESF as fast as an assault rifle can kill infantry. Why are the real problems being ignored?  Its a problem on every server, and on every continent, yet appeasing infantry is more imporant than fixing 1/3 of the game. The pilots have been ignored, are being ignored, and will be ignored.   One competent burster max, sky guard, or aa turret is enough to scare off ESF's...   Since capitalism...   Referring to the tree in my pants?.... No....? No?....... Okay :(   I feel like this video explains my opinions: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ela3ChTzFcA   I don't think an icon is needed. We have a count of enemy forces on the map. Just add another counter for air, an one for tanks. That way players can see how much infantry, air, and ground vehicles there are   Why does it make sense that ESF's die faster than infantry in 24-48 fights? Why cannot pilots enjoy battles too? I understand that from an infantry point of view ESFs can be OP if there is only 1 person trying to counter 2-3 of them, but 1 burster max can easily scare away if not kill a solo ESF.  G2A locks only kill a2a pilots trying to kill ground farmers. Maybe I should try farming the ground instead of going for enemy ESF's?   I don't ruin good fights, unless you count saving my fellow ESF's. I only play A2A on my new char: rainnnfall.   I am talking about just coming NEAR a 48 person fight.... Anywhere within 100m   I started to write a nice little thread, pointing out the flaws and possible solutions to the problem with AA not just from the perspective of a pilot, but of an average infantry player, and I realize there is no point.  I challenge any game developer to pull an ESF, and attempt to engage anything within 1 hex of a 48+ fight. Oh, and maintain a KDR of at least 1 for 1 hr.    Unfortunately, flak is everywhere, and can shoot across a hex or 2.   It's designed to be a deterrent, but it's a killer for any ESF in a dogfight.   The seat number was his...   The devs don't fly..... Ever...   Oh that's weird... When I tap anything with my ESF it just explodes.   Fairly good quality video. I find it kind of ironic that infantry claims flak is UP, when you can get kills that fast. To be fair, those air vics were sort of beat up, but flak is very powerful, you just got to know how to use it.   Sorry, forgot to talk to you. Add me on skype: train_subject9554 and send me a message   It's as updated as I can get it. Then again, apple products are shit anyways.   These cars are going to be a disaster. Our GPS systems still take us on nice long trips in circles rather than get you to highways.   The problem is that you don't make progress as fast as you should for directives.   What if this bug will never get fixed because It forces ppl to use implants?   Since the release of directives this problem seems to have increased. The last person to do damage to a target should not get the kill. I propose that the player who did the most damage to the target gets the kill.  Why wasn't this the system in place since the beginning?  	37
                                              HeadSmart Labs announces findings from a study on football inflation levels in different climates. The study indicated that the pressure in the footballs used in the AFC Championship game could have dropped 1.95 PSI from weather and field conditions alone.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxsXFX3tDpg         It's iMore's (Peter Cohen's) title - but agreed, it is misleading.   Thanks, I missed that line.   When Turing finally gets his decryption machine to work, he realizes that he cannot use the intelligence it provides without revealing his team's success to the Germans. So he tells his team they cannot reveal their success to anyone, even to his boss Commander Denniston. He then decides to go around his boss to the head of MI6, Stewart Menzies with the information.  How does Turing and the team continue to use the machine to decrypt German messages while keeping this fact secret from Commander Denniston who was intently interested in the team's progress and gave them one month to complete their task?

 For people wondering if it's even harmful or not...the answer is basically yes, no and maybe. The vapor from e-cigs does contain either none or far less of the cancer causing carcinogens from traditional tobacco, but it does have higher levels of other toxins and toxic metals. What are the effects of inhaling 2nd hand vapor containing these increased volumes is the question. Science isn't totally sure yet, but they know it's not great. Here's one article of many with this content: http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/08/29/study-second-hand-smoke-from-e-cigarettes-contains-toxic-metals/   http://i.imgur.com/kYvdJ8K.jpg   Yea, I agree. While the sentiment of slavery is always touchy, I think it's in how and why it's used. And I think that's why Keith Law mentions if you get offended by that stuff, maybe stay away from this game, but if you don't then you'll enjoy everything just fine.    Keith Law is a huge board game fan. He annually updates his [Top Board Games](http://meadowparty.com/blog/2014/11/18/top-60-boardgames/) on his personal blog. Pretty sure he did an AMA on /r/boardgames before too.  Edit: No AMA, but he commented on a [thread of his top 50 games of 2013](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1s9cgc/keith_laws_espn_baseball_writer_2013_list_of_his/)      Oh hey Snakes   Lattes employee! Do people really complain about the cover? I don't think it's unreasonable at all, especially since there's no time limit. A group of us from Buffalo come up, get there at opening on a Saturday and spend the entire day there. $5 to add gaming to my tab for all that? No complaints here.   Yep. Game gurus are great. Just wish they had more of them. We wanted to learn how to play Dead of Winter but the guru wouldn't teach us because it was on a list of games they aren't allowed to teach, only answer clarifying questions because of the time it takes to teach.    No kidding, really? I was there beginning of December, I didn't know they were adding a 2nd floor, I didn't see any construction. That's awesome.    I've been to Snakes   Lattes and their pub location Snakes   Lagers a bunch. Their set up, business plan and atmosphere is wonderful. And they are slammed. I live about 90 minutes from Toronto, so we usually try to make a day of it, show up first thing on a Saturday and game all day. By 2pm they're on a wait, and during peak evening hours it's probably a 2 hour wait. And the crowd is a very even mix of guys and girls. Gamers and social people. The social people are definitely the bread   butter, playing CAH, cranium and other party games. Their menu is limited, but it's good food. They do have a lot of games for sale (generally at full MSRP, but some were less). And I didn't really see anything for miniatures, but you could probably bring your own and play. They'll just charge you the regular $5 cover. We've brought a couple of our own games before.    Right. So your comment was doubly useless. If you fish for a man...   If you're going to comment on someone not having the courtesy to link to one of the previous discussions, at least have the courtesy to link to one of the previous discussions...   previously on /r/boardgames...   I meant on superbowl sunday   People let loose enough as it is. SuperBowl sunday is the 2nd biggest alcohol consumption day of the year in America behind 4th of July. Ever notice, outside of certain sports   SNL, there's really no good or big budget TV on Saturdays? People don't watch TV on Saturdays. Saturdays are people's 'going-out' day/night. Sundays are traditionally a more relaxed, stay-at-home-and-watch-tv day. There are always way more viewers on Sunday. If the NFL thought for a second they would get more viewers on Saturday, then they would but the Super Bowl on Saturday   check out /r/minipainting   I started following him and it's really almost always the normal pricing on Amazon or CSI or miniature market. It just looks like sales or deals because it's marked lower than MSRP   Ha, I've never seen so many bombs in a game. One round early in the game, our opponents each had a bomb in their hand   Maybe? I was high on adrenaline just recalling it. But it is a partner game of 2 v 2      *heavy breathing*    **The Battle of Tichu**  It was a bloodbath. Everything that could go wrong went wrong. Every hand loaded with 5's, 10's or Kings was bombed by our opponents. We tried to go "Grand Tichu" to hit a home run comeback. It blew up in our face. We were lost; scrambling like lost puppies in a rainstorm. We were being laughed off the table. The score was 385 to -110...but while the final battle seemed upon us, the end was not quite as close.   The tide began to turn with The Hand. Like Gandalf arriving at Helms Deep, sun parting the dark clouds of doom, it appeared in my hand to save the wretched day. Organized, the mahjong 1 card sat afar to the left...with sequential order the whole way through. A less daring Tichu has never been called. 3 tricks later, my opponent went out. Points rained upon us as our confidence boosted and our opponents began to doubt themselves for the first time.    The next hand...fire in our eyes, we both went out before our opponents, knocking them into a stunned, scared state. Suddenly, every card played was doubted, every move questioned. They had lost their way. We could taste our moment on the horizon.   But our opponents momentarily recovered. They steadied themselves amidst the next two rounds, winning 50 and 40 points each, taking the total to 475 - 465. This would be the final battle. Possible glory for two, possible total embarrassment for our friends that would be endlessly mocked for blowing such a huge lead.    My hand was dealt. I searched the cards for faces of Kings and Queens and Aces and Dragons. Nothing. Nothing but a lone Jack amidst a sea of small numbers. But upon closer look...a bomb of 3's. consecutive pairs of 66/77/88, three 9's and the Jack. As the beginning tricks of the round were dropped with singles, I passed. Sitting. Waiting for my moment. The perfect hand to bomb. It never came. A fair hand passed that my opponent would take, but it was bombed and lost. Our opponent was down to 4 cards. It was now or never, he played a pair of Q's. I bombed. And then readied myself for the final strike. 66/77/88. No one could match. Three 9's. No one could best them. And then I dropped the lone Jack, ridding all my cards first. The last out gave me their taken tricks and remaining cards. We counted the the final tally. It was victory for us. From the brink of defeat. From -110 points below our starting due to failed tichu's and thwarted hands, we rose and conquered our dear friends. And have laughed at them ever since.       Game store is different from cafe though. Game store needs people to come stay to entice them to buy their games on stock. Cafs have a very different business model and they're not selling those games on hand.    This is definitely the most common way. I haven't seen one that didn't, although there certainly may be. Snakes   Lattes in Toronto, perhaps the most famous board game cafe, has this model. Sit   stay as long as you want, play as many games as you want...it's $5 a person added to your bill for the gaming in addition to your food/drink.    **Wits   Wagers** is always fun! It's not too much pressure for knowing trivia since you get points by betting on whatever guess you want. I would definitely try to stick to vocally interactive games like many party games or CAH. Co-Op games like **Pandemic** would work nicely as well. **Pandemic The Cure** is a little lighter too if you can get it.   Ha, I literally just checked OLGS's and, for the first time, z-man's site and saw they had it there! $50 + shipping is real steep for an expansion. Hopefully this hits distributors or amazon prime soon. I can't wait. TM is my favorite game.    Games in this list that I can speak to...  **Firefly: The Game** is not good at all. It hits some nostalgic notes if you're a fan of the series, but if you take that out of the equation, the game falls very flat. I wouldn't go with this.  **Splendor** is such a good game. The mechanics are extremely simple (you either take tokens, buy a card or reserve a card), but you'll find a good amount of strategy, interesting decisions and replayability with it. And it's quick to play, and scales well for 2-4.    **Lords of Vegas** is loads of fun. Has some good strategy to it as well, with lots of fun twists. This game is somewhat dependant on your group...for instance I have a couple guys in my group that always love to take the risky options in games for the hell of it, so that makes this game a blast every time. It's such a fun time.   And if you like co-op, **Robinson Crusoe** is an absolute masterpiece and a must-own for any big co-op fan.   Did those board game shelves become a mini wall separating the rooms? That's some serious dedication.    Good stuff. I have all my games organized vertically, so stuff is always going everywhere. Which model of the Really Useful Boxes did you use?   Jamie from The Secret Cabal Podcast just got this. [Their Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/thesecretcabal) has a bunch of recent posts   pictures of the game. I have no idea what gameplay is like, but the miniatures and board look unbelievable.    What about **Super Dungeon Explore**?  /u/r2d8 getinfo   Yes...once :)    I've never played Xia, but lots of games have first play scenario's and I always say get outta my face first play scenarios, i'm playing the real game.    Talk about box art that does not match the game at all. Those are some colorful tiles, pieces and cards. Wasn't expecting that. How is this game? Sitting at pretty solid 7.5/10 on bgg   That could be true. I also think there's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy with established high ranked games. People pick them up because the see the rating and want to like it too because they think they're supposed to. Obviously they're all tremendous games, but there could be a bit of that too. I know I can give high ranked games more of a chance after a bad play because I know they're supposed to be very good.    Can't get it to play at work. Can anyone provide the run down?   Thanks! Also, how necessary are airbrushes? I've watched a few tutorials, they almost all use airbrushes, but it's out of my price range for starting out.    If you screw up painting a mini, is it pretty easy to "start over?" Give it a new primer coating and start over?    Why are you saying it that way?  *Saying whhat whhat whay?*   I'm not looking to become a master, just get some pizazz into mini's I have in some table top board games. I've looked into some starter kits, and I'm ready to pull the trigger, I just don't want to waste my time if it's something you really need some skill for.   Absolutely spot on. Great advice   When was who started being sarcastic first a question? I was. I'm usually sarcastic. You're just a downer. As I said before...lighten up   Welcome to the Internet where talking to friends about your interests is desperate lol. Good grief, dude. Lighten up.    You must be fun at parties. I'm well aware I didn't describe my intrinsic motivation for why I want to tell people about board games.    You know what I meant. I'm not being exclusive about the games. It was just for brevity in the title.    Great idea. This just usually comes up at parties when the conversation turns to hobbies or something. Can't exactly whip out Bruges from my back pocket. But the keep it short and sweet to theme and general mechanics is a good idea. It gets more difficult when I get the question "well what's your favorite game?" And I have to explain Terra Mystica..."well it's an economy and area control game where everyone place a mythical race, trying to terraform land and build buildings..." and then I lose them haha   Well he was just someone that rushed to 'oh D D' and clearly then had no interest in what I was saying. But other people, in general, have literally no concept of these games and just don't understand, keep asking for examples of games (that they'll never know about). I was just wondering what people do to explain the games to those people, short of making them watch a video or bust out a game for them.   There are lots of business planning and budgeting tools on the internet for start ups, especially cafes. All you'd have to do is take a look at those and then add however much you want to spend on stocking games   shelves.    I was trying to explain Dead of Winter to a co-worker and within 15 seconds he says "sounds like Dungeons   Dragons." People seem to always ask 'are these games like monopoly? risk? clue? or go off the other side and think it's D D. I usually end up just saying they have lots of strategy and victory points and they shrug, still not getting it.    Sure! Like anything, if people can easily find you and if you provide a unique insight while being entertaining, people will follow you. I think the most important part (outside of being able to be easily found) is to provide your own unique perspective. I watch a lot of video reviewers like SU SD, Watch It Played, Rahdo and Dice Tower and they all offer their own experience and angles. Be unique. Find your own angle that works for you, reflects who you are and is genuine. If it's good, people will stay.    edit: and to some of your questions - for me, nothing makes me fall asleep quicker in a blog than extensive rule run summaries. If I wanted in depth rules, I'd read the manual. I'd say if you're doing a full review, maybe stick to a brief overview of the theme, object and basic gameplay mechanics.   What about [**Amerigo**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137408/amerigo) or [**Lewis   Clark**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140620/lewis-clark)? Honestly, I haven't played either, but they're based around discovery   expansion (I think)   Well, I guess it's sci-fi but **Eclipse** pretty much starts with nothing but a few center hexes and you explore off those. And it's an awesome game.    Yea, I'm pretty sure we played the game half a dozen times before realizing that.    As long as they are connected via Carpet Ride ability (same for Dwarves with tunnelling), it counts for end game scoring of connected settlements. It does not count for creating a town.   It's like how indirect connection counts for end-game scoring, but not for creating a Town.    Oh wow...the game itself isn't similar at all to Terra Mystica. In TM you have direct   indirect interaction where you're cutting people off for land and building adjacent with money/power/vp exchanges. TM isn't the most interactive game, but it definitely has interaction, especially with 4-5 people, and 3 as well to a lesser extent. Castles of Mad King Ludwig has none of that. Each player has his own play area where you're building your castle. And unlike Suburbia where you can get bonuses based on what other's have built, in Castles you only get bonuses/penalties for what's in your Castle. The main interaction in Castles comes from the auction block. The "Master Builder" (which rotates like a 1st player marker) gets to take the 5/6/7 room tiles and arrange them in any order he wants on the auction block (ranging from $2k, $4k, $6k etc). So if you see people really need a certain room type, you may want to make it more expensive so they have to pay (and pay you, the master builder), but maybe not too expensive so no one buys it. So there's some interesting decisions to make on how you organize the auction block, trying to predict what people need and what they will or can buy.    numbers are also language independent  Edit: I'm wrong. Please ignore my comment and feel free to mock my wrongness.    You can also combine Cyclades and Kemet with an expansion, correct?    If you have access to a workshop, maybe you could cut the meeple (or something boardgame related) out of wood, stain/paint it and mount it on a trophy platform.    I haven't played Cyclades but Kemet and Eclipse are both owned by my group and hit the table regularly. **Eclipse** is one of my all time favorite games. I love the scope of the game, the economy management and the various legitimate paths to victory. It always feels like an epic game. On **Kemet**, I'm just not a huge fan. I really want to like this game and I get why people do, but it just hasn't clicked for me. Every game I play it feels like everyone is just ramping their stuff up and, bam, the game is over all of a sudden.       Oh man, I can't wait. That's the one I'm most excited for. Castles was just easier to get to the table. We've had Suburbia for awhile so it didn't take long at all to learn the rules. I just haven't had time to go through the Brass book and/or watch some walkthrough videos. I can't wait to play it though.    I think any time a game has custom pieces at all it's awesome. Custom D6? Sweet. Custom meeples? Awesome. Custom non-plastic money? Fantastic. It just shows an attention to care and quality in the game. The main reasoning for wanting Xia: Legends of a Drift System is because of all the custom miniature ships, metal coins and dice.    Agree with all this. The one thing I'd say about Trajan is that there are a ton of things you *can* worry about, but you're always best to stick to one strategy as much as possible. I think in a 2P game, construction is the dominant strategy. Then shipping overall. I haven't found a way to go all-in on Military as much as possible and win though.    I very much dislike Catan. Our group just played it death years ago. Once in a blue moon someone will suggest we play Catan and it gets to the table. If it does, I always put in Cities   Knights to add some depth to it. And without fail, about halfway through the game I think "why the hell did I suggest this? this will never end." Every damn time. I'll never learn.    The one thing I'll say about Feld games is they all scale very well. **Trajan** is a brilliant game, and I love playing it 2P. **Bruges** is a masterpiece, best with 3-4, but still very very enjoyable with 2. **Bora Bora** also goes well with 2P, albeit it probably shines more with 3-4 due to the meanness of blocking actions.    Yea, I've heard it balances it out. I'll have to tell my friend to pick it up.    Yea, I'm not sure if this one has a feature mechanic like the Trajan mancala wheel, or how dice are used in CoB or Bora Bora. I watched Rahdo's run through and he mentioned that as well, but still really liked it and talked about some of the unique things the game does as a whole.   And it does look really nice.   I got a brand new shipment of **Brass**, **Castles of Mad King Ludwig**, and **1775: Rebellion** in from Amazon, but was able to only play CoMKL of that group. I really like this game. We have Suburbia in our group as well, and our group does tend to lean on heavier games, but Suburbia just always felt fiddly to me...easy to mess up with erring on adjusting scores across red lines and missing a tile on someone's board. Castles really streamlines all that and the theme is much more fun. We laughed at each other's castles and made ridiculous kingly declarations as we built. Loved it.    Also got my all-time favorite game in, **Terra Mystica.** 4 players, I finished a distant second as the Dwarves, with the Fakirs cruising to victory. Fakirs used their Carpet Ride ability to grab the 18 point bonus at the end for biggest land mass, and they had 3 of the 4 cult tracks. Tons of end game scoring for them, very well played. This game is just so good with 4 people. I love it.   Had some lighter fare as well. Busted out a couple games of **Splendor.** I really enjoy this with 2P. I think it highlights the 'reserving a card' as you can use it a bit more defensively if you see someone grabbing coins obviously for a card that fits it. Very simple game with great replay-ability and solid depth.  I played **Machi Koro** for the first time. It was...meh? It didn't really grab me. I got a few cafes and the building stealing card and cruised. I'll play it again if people want but wouldn't recommend it.  And finally, in the Dice Chucker theme, this fits right in...I got a co-op game of my favorite dice chucker game...**Fortune   Glory!** This game is stupid fun. Traveling around, rolling dice, killin nazi's, finding treasure. It's awesome if you don't take it seriously and just have a good time with it. I've always leaned towards heavier euros, and cared more about mechanics than theme, but this game just grabbed me from the start with its Indiana Jones nostalgia, miniatures, funky artwork, I dig it.    That is a fantastic collection. Very similar tastes to mine...lots of games I have and even more that I want!   How is **Aquasphere**? I'm a big Feld fan so I can't wait to pick it up. I've heard it's very brain-burnery.    There is basically no theme. I guess you're building a castle manor with some animals and knowledge and ships and buildings? I've played this game hundreds of times (often online at boiteajeux.net) and I freaking love it. It's in my top 10 of all time for sure. It scales wonderfully from 2-4 people. It's simple mechanics, a fair bit of depth   strategy and lots of replayability with the different mats and randomization of when the tiles come out. It is a superb game. As everyone here will say, how the dice are used is really neat. It's a bit of luck sometimes what you roll, but with the workers and some knowledge tiles you can mitigate that and keep your long term strategy. It's fantastic.    Yea man, definitely not a slur. Dice Tower has some video reviews talking about the best ameritrash games of all time. And other podcasts similarly so as well   I just got Castles of Mad King Ludwig today! I'm unboxing it now. I'm really looking forward to it. I liked Suburbia but it was always a bit fiddly for me, checking other people's boards, making sure you're adjusting your income/population for every red line you cross. I like the theme much more in Castles, and I think it's streamlined some of that fiddliness.    Haha I'll give you that    I don't think it's insulting to call things ameritrash. Maybe for some people it is, I guess. That's just the name that got dumped on it really. I love me some ameritrash. Fortune   Glory is one of my all time favorites. I lean to euros usually, but sometimes it's just great to have go nuts in ameritrash    That's what's up /u/Starving_Fartist. I thought you were super new to games based on what your said about your collection, so I was just making a very simplified statement about the genres of games.    No, you're right. I'm the one getting angry and defensive lol. Have a good day on the internet!   Forgot to ask...you have both Suburbia and Castles of Mad King Ludwig...which do you like best?   That's a corgi, not a doge.   Yes, Mr. Thesaurus, I was making generalizations about the genres. I never said that ameritrash games couldn't have strategy. Those are what the genres are. Ameritrash - heavy on theme/experiences/randomness - Euros heavy on mechanics/strategy. Are there exceptions? Of course there are. Like anything in the world.    As you get deeper into board games, especially once you delve into medium to heavy weight euros, you'll see the thematic elements wane and strategy/mechanic elements increase. Some people love that. Some people look for board games to be more of a thematic elements aka "ameritrash" games. You may just prefer those types of games right now; lots of randomness, look, story telling, immersion and theme.  Try games like **Fortune   Glory**, **Betrayal at House on the Hill**, **Zombicide**, **Last Night On Earth**, **Nexus Ups** and many more. Those are all very heavy thematic and games with more of an immersion into the experience and theme.    [Hotels booked through GenCon](http://gencon.com/attend/hotelmap)   Actual question...have you ever travelled? Those are pretty much always the most expensive parts of any trip. How you spend money on daily activities/food/souvenirs is totally up to you.    Great collection! We have near identical tastes in games, my collection looks a lot like that, and ones you have that I don't are all on my wishlist. What's your favorite game there? Any regrets?   I think that's the opposite of the question...   For me, it would be **Eclipse.** You see a thousand ships, tiles for tech   science and resource cubes abound, but really when it comes down to it, all you're doing is choosing one of a few actions each turn til you can't do it anymore. Explore, research, attack etc. The mechanics are pretty straight forward once you know what you're doing.    The autosave files continually get corrupted and screw the game up every time. I can't find anywhere in the game to disable it   So we're just making fun of little people now? Calling them dwarves and laughing because they're on a spyder? How the fuck is that funny?   Maybe you should be on your conference call instead of posting to reddit.    Great explanation. Thanks a lot!   Yea, reading/watching some stuff on Xia just now is where I saw that term. Hadn't heard it before.       Some good work put in by /r/boardgames the last two days. I think we killed B N's and ThinkGeek's stock pretty quickly in back to back days      haha deal...Eminent Domain, Dead of Winter, Race for the Galaxy, Mice   Mystics, Suburbia, Manhattan Project, Power Grid and Sentinels of the Multiverse are yours :)    Wow, I've never really taken a look at all the components. Those are gorgeous! They come pre-painted like that? I'd say worth it. Crap, now I want to spend $85. Damn you.    ooo where did you get Xia? It's crazy expensive on Amazon right now. Did you just take the plunge or find a deal somewhere?   Great collection! Feel free to send me 1-80 games!   [Hmmm](http://i.imgur.com/cI8IHaS.png)   Haha nice! I love how we can rationalize game purchases. I've picked up Brass, Castles of Mad King Ludwig   1775: Rebellion in a CSI purchase and now Dead of Winter. All in the past week. I'll have so much unboxing to do, I'm so excited haha.   Yea it's not good! This was purchase #4 for me already haha.    [ThinkGeek Promo Codes](http://www.retailmenot.com/view/thinkgeek.com?c=6555525)  I haven't tried these, but here are some promo codes from retailmenot.  $10 off $50 - RTMN2015  $10 off when using VISA - VISAUS  $10 off $60 - SLICEOFPI   No problem!

Worked for me!    When you say "find a Kingdom," what does 'Kingdom' refer to? A strategy for your deck?   If you're leaving the board set, playing asynchronously, **Castles of Burgundy** might not be bad if you have the room. It plays great with 2 people, and it's not bad to play asynchronously as you can always see everything on the board. Just takes a second to remind yourself what your strategy is at.     A lot of the games deal with history, but producers Academy Games and GMT Games really focus on educational aspects for their publications. Not sure how many are geared towards younger audiences though.    So, 52 games a year?!   That doge on the left is definitely familiar with the cheese drawer.   I own both **Jamaica** and **Formula D.** Jamaica is definitely not my favorite game. It's super light with very little strategy or skill. Lots of luck. But it's fun with the right group and good gateway or filler game after a brain-burner.   I really like Formula D. Again, there is a good amount of luck, but there is some strategy and push your luck mechanics that make it more exciting. It's a lot of fun to see your friends try to push for the perfect roll and blow their car up.    Can I have it?   how about The Duke? It's chess-like, with a few twists...mainly flipping the tiles after you move them to give a new move pattern for that tile. And a turn option to grab a tile from your tile bag to place on the board. It's a lot of fun. One of my favorite 2 player games.   Nice. Is it still fun for the person who is the mastermind?   When you say mastermind...that's one of the players as well, right? Not just the mechanics of the game itself?   The art turned me off right away. I'm just not into anime at all. But I recently listened to a Secret Cabal podcast where they talked about it and, to their surprise, loved it. What are your thoughts on Tragedy Looper if you've played it?   Pretty sure I said my question was answered. Generally Amazon doesn't have identical things fulfilled by Prime with very different prices. So, yes, I'm quite familiar.    I hear ya. I hope I didn't come across as cynical, I was genuinely curious in the process!    Good luck with everything!  Question for you: how do you think something like this will do on indiegogo/kickstarter. The traditional product on this is something that the consumer can get or receive (i.e. a boardgame, toy, music, electronic etc), but as a brick   mortar store, only someone in your area could physically benefit from this. Why, besides out of sheer generosity, would someone outside your area be compelled to support this? Or are you simply expecting the support and funds to come directly from the Beverly area?   http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63740/hotel-samoa   Hotel Samoa? Hotel Tycoon? Maybe [Hotel Life](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4485/hotel-life)?   Ah, perfect. That was exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!   Ah, ok...so is there any actual difference in the games? Or just how amazon priced the 1st edition Artipia and the second edition that stronghold came on board with?   Well they're both amazon prime and both say 'by Stronghold Games' beneath the title. That's why I was confused.   [Here was my search result for it](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dtoys-and-games field-keywords=among%20the%20stars sprefix=among+the+%2Ctoys-and-games)   On the top row, I understand the middle is the expansion, but why is one Among The Stars listed as $29, and the other at $41? Just weird product coding by Amazon? There's no difference with the one that says Card Game, right?   **edit:** thanks for the responses, answered my questions!   [**Ghost Stories**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37046/ghost-stories) seems like a pretty good thematic match   it was $8.95 for me on ground shipping, $29 for priority.

 Let's not forget Gawker, Jezebel, MSNBC, and Salon, quite possibly the most biased news sites on the internet. http://i.imgur.com/S0j2kCD.jpg   I keep getting told by the left that all these terrorist Muslims are being oppressed and come from poor uneducated backgrounds, that this is reason why they commit acts of terror. Also I keep getting told that the Quran is the most progressive religious text out there despite numerous violent, sexists, and homophobic verses. So much for that theory, I guess reality doesn't quite have the liberal bias that idiotic SJWs keep shouting about.    I'm not surprised at all, a lot of feminists and SJWs tend to be very scummy.    The very same people that are eager to overlook Planned Parenthood's dark history are often the same people that are eager to point out the history of the battle flag of Virginia which they keep confusing for the confederate flag. It is as if things change but the left is very selective about applying the same standards to everything.    The author takes a look at a recent court trial's ruling and how it will affect the current rape hysteria trend and kangaroo courts that are popping up at various schools due to the pressures of Title IX.     	6
 Either that or the admins are stepping in...   I agree that would be great but I feel police today have a vested interested in keeping their current focus. I don't know if changing their focus would be possible without a lot of resistance from current police departments.   But changing what we call officers would have no effect at all on their actions and priorities.   I'm guessing this was somewhere in Williamson county?   Or add some salt   Yeah I guess I didn't make it clear but I actually have watched all of season 2-7 and for the most part it was fucking great. Just finished "All good things..." like 2 days ago which was a fairly fitting end for the TV show.   Out of curiosity I started watching TNG at the end of season 1 right before Riker got his beard because I caught a couple episodes on BBC: America before deciding to watch the whole thing and just wanted to continue from where I'd been watching. How good is the first season? After finishing season 7 it's going to be hard to go back to the beginning and I always have qualms about the first season of shows I think because of the Simpsons season 1.   One of the reasons for this has been the fact that we have over the years seen an excess of young players from continents like Africa or South America, who have been sent over or brought over by clubs to take trials that haven't worked out for them. And the players just don't have the money to be able to go back to their countries.  From [this article](http://www.npr.org/2014/04/06/299708689/after-scandal-barcelona-football-club-banned-from-trades) I found when I was trying to figure out what was going on   "The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."  Fuck I love Kevin Spacey too much not to include a House of Cards quote too.   Ive always loathed the necessity of sleep. Like death, it puts even the most powerful men on their backs.   I would think that the less serious cases of ebola are also less likely to get hospitalized or  to report it, making the morality rate skewed higher than it actually is. Just a guess though.   I feel in a post-technological collapse world, unless it was caused by something which would damage electronics, microprocessors and the like would become somewhat of a mine-able or forage-able resource for a time. There would people left to with enough knowledge to build new computers from scavenged parts or maintain old computers which still function. Granted this would might only happen once basic needs such as food and survival are taken care of, but perhaps not. Computers may be a big enough boon to planning how to rebuild infrastructure, beginning from the basics of providing water and food to an area of people, that they would remain useful as long as the power needed for them could be provided,   Do you hear your own voice super imposed over what you are actually hearing? No the two are distinctly separate for me. I imagine it would be the same visually. I can imagine an image without it impeding my ability to see why would this be any different?   I'm scared hold me   I don't know personally I've had especially coherent insightful thoughts while tripping. One of the many things I realized from the many times I have tripped is that words are constraining.   There weren't words for many of the sensations I felt, there was no way to describe my altered perceptions to anyone else who had never experienced it. It made me realize how truly confined  I am to my own body and words which were created, if you will, by someone who is not me.   Stephen Colbert once said, in an interview out of character, that every person had two names. One that describes him as other people perceive him, and one totally ineffable to anyone but himself that describes who he truly is. I think that principle also applies to a persons thoughts and feelings and it takes an especially eloquent person to transcend these barriers. It made me wonder if I will ever be able to know anyone else as they truly are.   Just to let you know next time you need to press enter twice when you want to start new line, not once.   Or you can put 4 spaces in front of something to make reddit display it as code Like this:       Syntax error     ?     Syntax error     h     Syntax error     /h     Syntax error   You are truly a great person and I wish him all the best. This has made something I or anyone I know have never experienced much more real to me.  As a recently graduated Biomedical Engineer I really hope I can contribute to improving cancer treatments at some point in my career because cancer is fucking fucked. I can't even find the words to describe my feelings towards it.    Haha how embarrassing   Haha oops I didn't watch it because I had already seen it. Thought they were different interviews   She said in an other interview that she tried teamspeak/vent/whatever and people recognized her voice...  Edit: I'm a dumbass and didn't watch this video before commenting because I had seen  itbefore.    Maybe it's just me but some unnecessary euphemisms, especially that try to downplay a particularly serious situation don't sit right with me. For example that some employees will be "more impacted" due to "company restructuring", instead of just calling it what it is, necessary company layoffs because the company has been under performing.   This situation already sucks, no one ever wants to have to get rid of employees or be laid-off themselves but when this does happen, everyone knows what's going on. These euphemisms don't help the situation at all, you can do something like this in a respectful manner without treating adults like children who can't handle the reality of what's happening..    After 2 drinks a lot, if not most, men at least will have a BAC below .08.   What is up with this ref. The majority of the calls he has made have been wrong and have also had a game changing effect.   I figure incineration is pretty good at getting rid of pathogens too so I was just wondering what the point of doing both is. It seems a little redundant. Maybe it's autoclaved prior to transportation to an incinerator or something?   Out of curiosity what is the point of autoclaving it before incineration? Just to ensure that no pathogens are spread prior to destroying it?   That's really interesting, it'd be awesome if it was actually him. I wouldn't be surprised.    No but I also don't believe *every single* post that mentions a company in any way is definitely posted by that company as a means of cheap advertising. I'm sure it happens but I don't jump to that conclusion without evidence. Throw in the fact that OP's account is over a year old, has a decent amount of karma and does not mention this company any other time and I feel that it is a reasonable doubt.   Did you ask him about the details? Why did he do it? Where did he end up landing after parachuting out of the plane? How did he get from there to a town and eventually to Mexico? What did he do with all the money, why did very little of it enter circulation etc.?   That's really interesting. Was his story convincing enough that you actually believe it?    Story?   It will definitely be a good game. I'm hoping di Maria will be able to play, Argentina looked a little lackluster today without him.   I wouldn't be surprised if Neuer saves all 5 if it comes down to penalties but I would be surprised if it even comes to penalties. That's not Germany's style   I agree. It was the polar opposite of last game   Yep, penalties are kind of lame...   The ESPN stream can't take the pressure. Gah stop buffering!   I guarantee he's studied the shit out of Argentinian players and how they take penalties. I bet keeping him in was planned and he's gotten helped preparing by Krul too   I agree but a game like this game could easily go on for a very long time. I don't know if that's the right thing to do either.   Childrens hospital was filmed at the hospital afterwards but since that show changed locations in the last couple seasons it makes sense that the hospital is gone n ow   Yeah I agree getting hit with a shot is much much worse, goalies are a crazy, tough breed.   Yeah you're right, I guess it was just during practices now that I think about it. It was 6 years ago so everything is kind of blurred together at this point. It did make practicing in the 100 degree Texas heat a bit more bearable.   As a former college attack, it also kind of sucks to get beat on by 6' poles.   Definitely did they same thing playing attack except I didn't wear elbow pads at all. Getting beaten on with 6' titanium poles is a bit less intense than what goalies had to go through though.   They definitely do, he must have been just fucking around and not in an actual game or something.   Yep my highschool in Texas had enough people for 3 separate teams, JV, D2 varsity and varsity. Really fun sport I miss it a lot, especially playing attack and not have to run constantly all game.   I don't really miss getting beaten on with 6' titanium sticks all the time though. I never wore elbow pads either and took the actual shoulder pads off my shoulder pads so they was just chest pads too. Probably wasn't the smartest thing to do.   I'm reading Shogun right now, actually left the last 20 pages for this evening. I've been wondering how historically accurate it is...Are you saying it's not very accurate? If you've read it  Edit: in the book the samurai, especially the lower tier ones, seem to take bushido pretty seriously but have no qualms about disregarding it when it is useful to them.     they weren't bound by some code of honor or anything like that  Uhh isn't that exactly what bushido is?   Except that's not how it works. As far as I know, the reddit fuzzing algorithm basically took the actual number of upvotes and varied it by a certain percentage. This percentage increased with the total number of votes. They then took varied the number of downvotes in the same manner so the comment's total karma was relatively close the to the actual comment score.   Go for it man. Maybe if you look back on these post in 5 years when you're 18 you'll realize how much of a douchebag you are but have fun until then.   Next time be cordial when trying to make your point. It may have been valid but berating people like that is going to nothing but make you look like a huge fucking douchebag   You're a braver man(woman?) than I. I didn't dare to venture into the putrid cesspool that is surely his comment history. The strange thing is he is not a negative karma troll just a angry man. I would imagine he is very socially inept if he figured that would be an effective way to make his point.   I didn't believe it either but a doing a quick google produced   [this](http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/27/world/la-fg-north-korea-meth-20140127).   I know right! All I did is say what everyone else is thinking, I don't think I deserve gold for it, but hey I'll take it!   Hey, asshole  OP is doing some genuine good in the world. Maybe the charity he chose to donate to isn't the best possible choice but that is no reason to insult him.   Your further promotion of this radical organization will not be tolerated.  Tolerated by who? You think arrogantly think you're speaking on behalf of all of reddit. You think OP is actively promoting this organization out of malevolence and not because he is trying to help?  Fuck off   Germany didn't play their best but I feel Germany was by no means lethargic   Let's hope Mueller is ok!   What a great game!   No it's in our interest to Germany to win i believe.   Give that corner to Klose!   For once Klose off key and off target =(   One of the best matches so far! Since so many good games in this WC!   No they can't!   Neuer... best goalkeept in the world!   Oezil! Too good of a passer   I'm just glad it wasn't against the US   Me too! Germany has always been my favorite team because the US normally isn't very good. I'm so conflicted!   Schweinstieger scores in the 87' to win it for Germany.   Ahh so out of character for Lahm why that back heal?   If you mean a devastatingly effiecent, wurst eating, beer drinking badass then I agree   You guys are good! Definitely a world class team,   I've got a raging efficient German boner too!   This world cup is fucking awesome.   If Ghana wins 3 teams have 3 points. It means we have to beat Portugal to have a advance. Otherwise if Germany wins we are in I believe   By scoring a goal! That's how   That frontflip!   Klose!   It seems like they have potential to go far in this tournament   Get your shit together Germany. Deutschland ueber alles(ausser USA)   Most upsets in the world cup group stage ever? I'm not losing hope, Deutschland ueber alles(ausser USA)!   I know right. Wtf!   Hope he's in good enough form!   Warum spielt Schweinsteigter heute nicht? Ist er zu alt geworden? Bitte antworte mir auf English mein Deutsch ist Scheisse ich habe Deutsch nut seit zwei jahren studiert(If you can't tell already lol)   I swear that just looks like a blink not a wink. Am I seeing things?  Edit: One more question for an ignorant American, why is Schweinsteiger not in? Is he out of form? He's my favorite player   Yeah and my retarded post was definitely 100% serious    As much as I hate this reddit cliche very relevant username. Mr. Broken leg's is too, the seven at the end obiously refers to his age   Unfortunately that makes a lot of sense. Thanks, hope I helped you feel a bit more productive today. Good luck on the BAR! A shot in the dark but I'm guessing from your username you're at VT law or did undergrad there?   I'm not sure if you would know this but would her sentence in the US would have been much harsher? Let's say she was charged with battery, reckless endangerment, hit and run and hopefully a couple other charges the prosecution could have added on(criminal negligence?)   I found some stuff I've already posted multiple times but /u/TheMSensation is the better internet detective as you can see above   Not even close! She should have gotten attempted vehicular manslaughter but I'm pretty sure that's not a real crime. Maybe assault with a deadly weapon?   Apparently the video poster commented "she got away lightly with a 2 year suspended, 200 hours community service, 2 year ban and had to pay the victim 500 compensation".   The man suffered a broken leg and  she got away lightly with a 2 year suspended, 200 hours community service, 2 year ban and had to pay the victim 500 compensation according to the video poster   Haha you beat me finding it by 1 minute! I found the video OP's comment "she got away lightly with a 2 year suspended, 200 hours community service, 2 year ban and had to pay the victim 500 compensation"    So the original video poster ended up saying this "she got away lightly with a 2 year suspended, 200 hours community service, 2 year ban and had to pay the victim 500 compensation"    Not only that she deserves to lose her freedom for a couple years at least. Hope she got charged with attempted vehicular manslaughter or something like that.   To my American ears that sounded pretty tame but I'm sure its not. Would that be the British equivalent to fuck your work you fucking piece of shit?     I really want to figure out what happened to that piece of shit. I hope someone finds a follow up article or something that states her punishment   That was definitely my favorite post I read that entire day. You brightened my and I'm sure any others day, rolled with the punches so people were laughing with you not at you and I guarantee everyone in your workplace knows you now. This could have happened to anyone. People know that and this will open up more doors than it closes.    Are you by chance related to DICK PLACE?   You are a dick.   First 32 seconds and last 10 minutes! I'll take it   It was really good! Definitely better than a lot of TV shows on the air today. I could see this being a sketch on WKUK or something along those lines   Here's a big more context for anyone who hasn't had a chance to google the first quote yet.  UN Chief Weapons Inspector Hans Blix, revealed in an interview in 2003 that Vice-President Dick Cheney said to him we will not hesitate to discredit you in favour of disarmament. In other words, tell us there are WMDs or we will claim youre incompetent and go to war anyway.   That's exactly how I feel about fringe.   They could probably even use my high school stadium!   Honestly I had to try pretty hard to come up with someway to disagree with you but I felt it was necessary   I feel like the meme format detracts from the seriousness of the situation a bit though. Maybe its just how I view memes but this post would have hit front page regardless of how it was posted and a news story would have given more context. I came into the comments to figure out who this group of people is and some more insight into what exactly this petition is for. I haven't really found anything except shitty jokes and this loser I went to high school with but I guess that's reddit for you.   Fuck you ryan   Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly;  Man got to sit and wonder 'why, why, why?'  Tiger got to sleep, bird got to land;  Man got to tell himself he understand.   My high school offered basically all AP classes and I took everyone I could except for US and World history. I also got credit for every test I took and even passed an addition AP test for a class I never took. I ended up coming into college with 28 hours although I think some of my AP credits didn't count toward my major and weren't part of that 28. I was just shy of the 32 hours required to be considered a sophomore     Also, a lot of colleges limit the amount of hours you can come in with out of high school. I didn't know you can come out of high school with an AA/AS degree but what I did was tough enough. Be careful not to push them too hard.   True I worded that wrong, should have said some scientists. I personally believe that we have no idea the full extent of the chain effects eliminating mosquitoes would cause or whether the good would outweigh the bad. I just wanted to point out a different perspective.   Mosquitoes may be one of the few organisms that we can live without, and many scientists believe that their elimination would cause no ecological harm.

 Ah, well that's alright then! We shall continue our grand-shower-puddle-dropping with eased minds :)      Why is that hard to believe? My SO has a large bosom, and we're children at heart.   Yeah we're not that fussy to be fair!   I do a version of that- when my SO and I are showering I press myself up against her and we wrap our arms around each other so that the water catches in a huge cup between/around her boobs between us, then let it fall with a HUGE splash...   I do this too- my ex didn't used to either, and I asked the exact same question. How do you know when you're clean!?   Sink low in the bath water, so that my mouth is just under the water line (nose above because breathing), and blow out bubbles.  Occasionally I'll say "Krabby, use bubble!" first...   When I'm hiding (like behind a door or in the wardrobe to scare my SO) I get a violent fully-body shiver that runs all the way down my spine. It feels a little pleasurable, buts it ALWAYS happens.   I had this conversation with a female coworker last week, I know how self conscious women can get, but honestly, unless it's like male-length, us guys can't tell if you've shaved or not (without touching or close-up examination).   What do you count as circumstance that you "have" to? (Out of interest)   Fart under the covers and keep them sealed so it warms you up  And/or  Wafting the covers to spread that unique fart smell.   Misread instructions, googling best way to clean shit out of shower   So I see all these posts of stuff from Japan, and obviously they have a couple of Pokemon Centers but, is there Pokemon merchandise in just like, all the stores?  Also, where is this Pokemon Cafe!? (Cause I wanna go)   Aw I got excited because I thought you meant the awesome piece Lugia's Song from Pokemon The Movie 2000...man I loved that track.   When you've been using your iPhone (or similar) for a long period of time, does your little finger/lower fingers go numb?   I'll shamefully admit to buying a full-shiny-pokedex Emerald way back in the day. Don't even know what happened to it, but it was interesting, for a while...   And the temptation is already building. The weekend was easier, as my girlfriend was with me, so I was distracted and couldn't even if I wanted to...but it's tempting.  Does it get easier? What techniques can I use to forget about the urge?   Thanks all! Is there any way to combat the decay without visiting a dentist? I'm not against it really, but I'm travelling currently, so a dentist visit would probably be quite expensive.   I've been lax lately, and whilst I have brushed every few days, I've noticed some dark/black bits in my teeth (cavities?) and one tooth has a sharp edge where this black bit has potentially broken it, so I want to crack down and get serious.  Recommendations for paste, brush and foods to avoid?   I'm new to this, have written a few extremely short things for my SO, but never intended for a general viewing...any tips?   I think he's not right for you- if he's essentially blackmailing you with this it's unacceptable. Imagine what he'd be like later in the relationship if this type f behaviour carries on!  I'm glad you're not ashamed of being on a dating website- there's nothing wrong with it- but I'd recommend owning up to your family and ditching him.  Sorry that you've seem to have found a bad apple there.   What sub-reddit made YOU laugh/cringe/surprised/shocked/disgusted when you discovered its existence?   NSFW because I know what you guys are like...   You keep your chin up, my friend.  You like what you like, and that's okay. It's different, but that doesn't mean it's wrong or right. It's just different.   Aside from reading lots of books, I've self taught myself how to write.  My solution? Write it and write it again, until it doesn't read like crap! It's sounds stupid, but reading it out loud to someone (I read to my GF) really helps you spot the errors in everything.  Best thing to do is get it onto the page- write it without editing or rereading it until you're done. It's easier to edit a crap novel into a good one than just write a good novel instantly. Only the super-pros have that kind of super power.   I've got two short stories published, both are charity works so no money, and a third coming out this year at some point (date TBC). Don't know about how much I get paid for the coming one, it's been a while since I signed the contract!!   Edited to reflect.   For those of you who miss the obvious, complete a pokedex made entirely of shiny Pokemon.  Edit: Without hacks   What age did you first orgasm? How/what was the circumstance? (Like to porn, just mucking around, etc)   My first time was on my Dad's boss' computer- we lived next door to the office he worked in at the time (it was a house converted to an office), and I used to go up there to mess about on the games (it was the only windows pc in the office).  No idea what made me do it, but I decided to use the Internet to look for digimon stuff (I was like 12). Cue nervously sitting there whilst the dial up modem screamed out its tones. Dad didn't hear or didn't care, so I continued, and after a while I accidentally bookmarked a page.  So I go to bookmarks, and find an odd-looking link. Curious teen I am, I clicked it, turns out my Dad's boss was gay, and it was a gay porn site's front page. I figured if there was guys there must be girls, and so did a search...I don't know if there were free sites around in those days, but I looked at the front page teaser pictures LOADS.  Can't remember exactly how long I continually snuck up there after office hours, but I do remember being asked by Dad to accompany him into his boss' office one day- that's right, dial up modem = print-out of websites visited on the bill. I wasn't exactly told off, just told not to use someone else's property (especially one that costs) without permission.  TL;DR, my first was on my Dad's boss' pc.      Final Fantasy VIII - loved the score all throughout it, and how it changed in the game.  That said, whilst it wasn't exactly groundbreaking, the Pokemon music will always live on in my heart as one of the most iconic. The original Pokemon Centre music, or the Route 1 walking music.   If you didn't want to retrade a semi-fix would be to breed them so you get a version of said pokemon "originally" from your current game.   Can you explain the dexnav guilt thing further? Having not played I've no idea what the dexnav is, nor why you'd feel guilty!   This was my first thought when I saw his mega. Still not a general mega fan.   It looks like it says Peckachu...I giggled   I've not played it myself, but I read on another thread someone didn't like the fact that in ORAS you're just given latios instead of having to hunt it down.  Out of interest, what other negatives have you found?   I feel we need to see a version of the sexy dress/undress to properly appreciate this.  Seriously though, good for you for feeling sexy and doing something daring. The world (and I'm sure your neighbours day) is brighter for it.   I'm game to try anything, so will happily look at any anthology. I've got two shorts published already with a third out this year, looking to submit to more!      Totally!  A lot of people linearly categorise male sexual feelings with the penis but, whilst I do love it being attended to, it's not the only part of my body!  Massage, stroking, tickling, licking, kissing, nibbling pretty much anywhere on my body is great- it's the attention that turns me on most.   To answer the question, i'd say talk to him about it. Or get your brother to, it'd be less squeamish for him if it was mano el mano.  But yeah, don't do it as a confrontation (because, as you stated, everyone has a curious streak, especially at that age), just stress the cleanliness/hygiene side of things, and if you want to/feel comfortable doing so, drop in the line about being willing to buy him something of his own.  Make it casual, above all else, as I can think of nothing that would be worse (for him or you) than you coming down like a tonne of bricks on him about it.  Source: Gleefully curious youth     	42

Much of a muchness really, when you're trained to fight in a street scenario it's never about death, it's always based around defusing the situation and making sure you're not in danger anymore.   This can be by walking away from it, or if you really do need to fight, it's about disabling your attacker as quickly as possible, then walking away.  You're taught which spots can kill, and these are generally the ones you avoid.  Source: Am 30 now, and been training on and off since I was 7 in 3 types of martial arts.   Thanks mate..

This annoying sensation can becausedby dry skin, skin irritation, dirty skin, insect bites, disease, parasites such as lice, or even forpsychosomaticreasons. Researchers believe this sensation came about as a way of teaching us to avoid irritants and preserve the skins health.  Scientists have made progress in identifying neurotransmitters responsible for causing the itching impulses in the brain, a team from the National Institute of Health has been able to identify which of those factors is primarily responsible for driving the sensation. The research was led by Michael Iadarola of the NIHs Department of Perioperative Medicine and the paper has been made open access in the journalMolecular Pain.  Itching is believed to be caused by gastrin releasing peptide (GRP), natriuritic precursor peptide B (NPPB), and neuromedin B (NMB). A study published inSciencein May 2013 identified a significant part of the pathway that NPPBwhich is produced in the heartuses to trigger the itching sensation in mice. The authors of that paper worked on Iadarolas team to make quantitative measurements about the potential role each neuropeptide plays in causing itching.  The current study used a technique called RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify where and in what quantity the itch-causing neuropeptides were being expressed in mice, rats, and humans. The results supported the previous study inSciencethat implicated NPPB as a primary cause of itchingat least in mice. As it turns out, rats and humans dont express NPPB in their sensory ganglia. However, all of the tested species expressed NPPA, which acts on the same peptide receptor as NPPB.  NMB was expressed in high levels at sensory ganglia across all three species, hinting that it has been evolutionarily conserved. The results also showed that GRP was not expressed in any of the three species, refuting the long-held notion that it plays a role in producing itching. The misidentification likely came from interactions between anti-GRP antibodies and NMB in the sensory ganglia. This could mean that previous studies based on GRPs supposed role in itching need to be reevaluated.  While scratching acute itches can bereally, really satisfying, certain conditions can trigger the desire to scratch excessively, which can break the skin and haveserious consequences. Understanding the pathway involved in causing the itch sensation would allow researchers to potentially create a way to block those molecules. If the pathway could be altered, it could be used as a treatment and bring significant relief to those suffering from psoriasis, eczema, and other chronic skin conditions.  www.iflscience.com   Perfect for those who lung hit   Hope you're ok..

 Hello, fellow English major! I suggest grabbing some graphic novels or books to distract you for a bit. Maybe join a club at school or a sports organization.    Before I moved into my college dorm (total roommates: 4) I was really worried about moving in with a bunch of people I didn't even know very well. I thought I would have issues communicating or getting along with them but two years later and I am still doing fine. Not so surprisingly, adapting to people becomes much easier when you spend a lot of time with them. After the initial getting to know you phase you will gradually become more comfortable with your roommate. At first you may feel frustrated and desire alone time, but as you become more adjusted into dorm life, things will generally feel more comfortable to you. Thankfully, if you need more alone time you can find it on your own either outside the dorm or within it. Most likely, you and your roommate will have separate schedules so you are bound to have some privacy or quiet time. Interactions-wise, I would participate in getting to know your neighbors since this is a beneficial and fun- relationship. If you want the full college experience you need to be social to a certain agree so dont be afraid to get out there, even if you feel uncomfortable. Clubs, dorm events, and activities on campus are great ways to get to know and meet people.. To be a better dorm partner, I would be respectful and considerate of all things. Talk about house rules the moment you guys have a chance to, and stick to them as well as you can. Open communication (in a friendly manner) will make both you and your roommate happier. If you have a bad dorm partner approach them about the issue or talk to someone who works for residential services. I suggest the former because most issues can be worked out through communication. Good luck!     What inspired you?   This was super interesting but.. family was spelled wrong in the visual representation.   I was thinking casinos, fancy clubs, yachts, and of course auctions.   My sister had a similar (though hilarious) experience like this. So, my mom, sis   I are out at a pizzeria (we have more of these in Jersey than stop signs) when my sister starts choking a particularly stringy piece of a cheese calzone. My mom   I are sitting across from her and the TV is over her head. Anyway, my sister calls for my mom and what does she say?  Give me a minute, I wanna see this. It must've been 3 or 4 "mom!" shouts later when my sister gets the jist and goes fishing in her own throat with her hand for that cheese. Triumphantly, she pulls it out and thus declares my mom a jackass.   Dude you look great!    Those eyes take away some artistic points.. but otherwise A+ material!   Shamelessly eating a full pint of Ben   Jerry's.   FFX- Besido island   I'm sorry you went through this.  	11
 Thanks. Going to have to try that next time.    How did the bags get like that?   	2
 I love stuffed artichoke. But they are seasonal and rarely done right.      Muffalatta is another but a heavy task to eat so  i stay away for the most part   Wtf?   The movie "The prestige" and the 2 different theories surrounding the machine in it   I mean come on use your imagination, but here is a few      1.Disliked tyson     2.Money on the fight     3.Money on the round it would end in, not specifically the fighters     4.a much more memorable fight with tyson losing, having him in the spotlight     5.he was tired, ready to go home     6.Money on tyson getting knocked out, which was probaly like a 1000 to 1     7.Paid off by douglass      On and on. Im not saying it was melicous but its a possibility. He might of just made an error. But to say tyson got the same count and time to get up is easily debunked by the tape, its an obvious difference. Half a second can be a world of difference to a boxer in that situation, and its a more than half a second difference. Again im not a big tyson fan, but a big boxing fan and there is concern about the difference in counts that ruin the fight for me.      If you like the big upset aspect of a fight as you said in your first post, look into Rumble in the Jungle, Ali wasnt even supose to Survive the fight, thats literally what they said. There was major concern for his well being. The KO is the greatest moment in boxing history imo   The prestige, the machine Doesnt Work. It makes more sense in the context of the film, but i concede there are holes in both theories   Moby dick by Led Zeppelin. Best drum rolls ever   Doggie style, nothing crazy here.

And stupid question from OP music is opinion based nobody can tell you whats a good genre you have to decide for yourself   Freedom, from django. When the background voices start that "Ommmmm". Gives me chills just thinking bout it   You wouldnt have to go, you could refuse and suffer the consequences.     Would i go? Depends solely why we are at war.   That dont sound horrible, but on a cookie....idk maybe not for me.      Theres something called Fish sauce or something to that effect. Made from rotting fish heads, and other things. Commonly used by vietnamese to produce soups and some instances for dipping sauce. Great cooking tool, but terrible for dipping imo   Again fair points i have to say. Id like to look more into dual serial killing as well.     Just a fun fact, they made a bank out of that "murder castle". Employees had been in the basement and had strange stomach turning feelings. Even saw evidence of the "hot box" and other stuff, pretty wild. It operated well into the 1900's. Eventually being tore down and the basement filled in.   My research finds the rumor implausible but it is a possibility. And i believe one of his relatives swears he was and had documentation or something   Fair enough   Yes. A burger is still awesome whether the cow speaks english   Wtf is vegemite?   Peanut butter and bananas. Usually thin chopped banana on toast with lightly spread PB, off the chain!!!   People will always find a way to cheat. Take their ability to cheat away they are the bum you always knew they were   You can be exploited before you "win" is my point   Giving up the pussy has nothing to do with exploiting the power of the pussy. Most guys "pussy whipped"  have never had that pussy but they are whipped by the implication of getting some, ie pussy power   Fair points. Although i will point out they were a team, not technically a serial killer, i bring that up not to be snotty but alot of dual person crimes n killing are brought on by encouragement of the other. In some cases the crimes would not have been comitted w/o such. Edited post a bit regardless     Yea erick larsons' book was amazing.

One of the most honest interview you will ever see from a convicted killer.     Is he considered a serial killer though, he only killed for money?   His story was embellished but a little harsh to hate someone who spent most of his adult life serving your country.   Thats creepy as fuck yo, maybe not wrong morally but definitly creepy   He is rumored to have been h h holmes who was caught and convicted, but of other murders   Wanting random pics of such would qualify as creepy...   Any. Everything is better fried   This, no doubt. But Wow what a creepy name......   I agree but much better without a bra   Bernie maddoff   Fan circulation distributes the heat.

Your first comment to me lead me to believe you favored this now im not so sure now   Every song is great, how can you not mention The ocean, the song remains the same, or threst really. They have some popular songs but its never on any top 100 list and always overshadowed by Zeppelin 2 and untitled.     To me its the best ever, at least top 20 taking in different genres, but if it aint in the top 20 underrated imo.       If you are looking for more obscure, Silvertides' "Show and tell". Great unknown album, sounds like the Black crowes meets Ac/Dc. Aint coming home is an unknown anthem   Damn, sounded like it came from the heart and yet i cant stop laughing   Temper   Houses of the Holy(album) Led Zeppelin   I could see that, barely but on the other hand what constitutes good hobbies? Wouldnt this be an easy question to lie about, with no way to check on? Would you disqualify someone for not having hobbies but is qualified for the job? Imo relatibilty is overrated in an interview. Its arkward and nervewrecking to begin with and someone who is relatable during this process has no direct correlation to their relatabilty to co workers.   What are your hobbies? WTF does it matter what i do in my spare time, ridiculous   Why would you need wikipedia knowledge to explain this?   Lol i dont even know what that means, "fucker her"??   Yea ill think ill read it myself   Many. Cooking, music, dancing, fighting the british, fighting both World wars etc. and major contributions to all named. What you seem to fail to realize is not every southerner supported or participated in slavery. And you rounding us all together is offensive, bias and a damn shame to those southerners who did.     Do you define your "inheritance" or "tradition" by profiting off the slaughter of Native Americans? Are you so nieve to believe northerners all supported the war or made no profit off of slavery? Do you attack christians for their dark days?    Wikipedia is about as reliable as your dope head uncle. He can be depended on sometimes but other times he is talking jibberish.   What?? Why wouldnt they read it themselves instead of waiting to get though?   I defined it three different ways already. Rebel flag, tradition, and inheritance. This is your post and question which i cant answer if you cant define your own question.   Many people, of all races gender and size, exploit whatever they can, alot of people just want a free ride. Gold diggers exploit the power of the pussy   Not all oscar nominated movies are disney like. Do some research before hand.   Sound about right, probaly searching for an applicable post atm   It seems he doesnt even know what southern heritage is, or at the very least clearly define it.      He seems like the type of person to bitch about the confederate flag but ignore the nazi symbols or christian symbol in the country and ignore all the horror and slavery associated with them. Also type of person to get uppity only when a racial crime is covered by the media and ignore the countless others that happen every day. May be wrong but this post leads me to believe not.   I dont know if id even watch it. The first 4 seasons were amazing but after that i was just hanging around for the most depressing end ever   If you are defining southern heritage as the rebel flag, ill agree with most of what you said. But i also respect those to have a different opinion and their right to wave a flag, any flag. Should they change the flag, no, its historical. Should it be hung from government buildings, that is a tricky question, and imo no. But do i care if my neighbor has one on his car, house, shirts, no and frankly neither should you. Not every northerner was against slavery either. For that matter there are just as much racist northerners as they are in the south, now and back then.     If your defining heritage as tradition, or inheritance, again not every southerner supported or participated in slavery. Do you define your family traditions by every wrong they have ever done? Is it possible in your mind to uphold your family traditions even if you disagree with their actions? Do you define your northern heritage as having a major hand in the wrongful slaughter of the Native americans?      Also on another note. Slavery was only combated partially on the notion of human rights, and the slaves lively hood. And partially because the south and its exports, cotton,etc, could charge whatever they wanted. The north had no leverage, they couldnt boycott forever. The south wasnt effected by such because they didnt pay their workers. So eventually the north would have to agree to much higher price than deserved. The civil war was fought partially for human rights and partially for economic of goods, including a few other reasons.     Your post implies that all southern heritage is from slave owners and the northern heritage has no such implications, this is ludicrous. I would assume most reasonable people in the country dont feel that way. Every person who lived in the north were not against slavery nor do they have clean hands when it comes to racism and equal rights, same can be said of the south.    Not everyone in the south has slavery in their past. Not everyone in the south at the time of slavery supported it. So, no, kind of a stupid and bias question in of itself.   How would that stop the virus?? They built a whole walled in city that didnt help but a shotgun would? Unlimited ammo?   Ever seen Ali vs Foreman?   Not someone like Ali, they have had people train to fight for real for their whole life couldnt beat Ali in his prime, what makes you think someone who just fake fights could?   Why would you want to know this on a serious basis?   Rounders. Worm is one of my fav characters of all time   Crazy to think 2000 is "old" music   Creationism   1.Shower     2.Work     3.Get high or drunk. Mostly both     4.Sleep      5.Repeat   Ali no doubt. Ali didt fake fight for a living....   Tip drill   Of course it does   The dexter finale, sad for me it ended in the worst way, knowing i spent all those hours watching episodes just to be let down   Explain it in a realitive easy to understand way   Be the natsiest Sob in there, dont wipe your ass,etc   When i get the intial feeling i got to piss, dont know why   28 days later   Few more questions for you, btw thaks for the repiies.     1.How does the protein on the egg thing age 5 or 6 years if the box can only go back as far as it has been initialy set?      2.Is it possible aaron tells Grady(father) about the machine after the original party incident where something presumbaly happens to his daughter?  take the emergency coversation abe and aaron have into play     3.Is there a logical explaination for why Granger is sitting outside aarons house and why he ran away after following them?   1.Ok so every box usage creates a parallel timeline. So we are being talked to from aaron 2 from the 3rd timeline? Because timeline 2 doesnt have a 3rd aaron, and once the timelines pass the loop the original cease to exist so thats why there is 2 left at the end? With this logic there would have to have been 3 abes but he doesnt use the machine with aaron the 3rd time he goes alone to switch with aaron2, so why are we left with the same number of abes and aarons when they didnt use the machine the same amout of times?     2.Ill buy that     3.REDDIT     4.Ill buy that, and i originally assumed that. But what do they do with the body(i realize this is speculation), or they keep the body till it passes the loop and it ceases to exist? Wouldnt keeping the body at aarons have aaron1 directly crossing paths with 2 n 3(which aaron does cross paths but abe doesnt know that and trys to prevent such an act so why would abe willing do this?)?      5.So they are voluntarily up in the attic? Was this explained why they went in the attic instead of say a hotel?   Their awake?   1.So you are saying the only aaron left at the end is the one building the bigger machine? What about the 2 abes, the one watching for aaron and the original?    2.How would aaron 2, narrator, know about the last timeline, or the countless times he went back to change the partys outcome?     3.Ill buy that, just seemed like there was more to it.     4.It seemed like how Granger found out and used the machine was a complete mystery to aaron and abe, did they figure it out? They never actually use the failsafes together and i thought abe at that point was unaware that aaron knew about the fail safes.      5.Ill buy that, but why can the girl hear rat like sounds in the attic?    Never seen EH, but i have seen this graph. It contradicts some other explainations ive seen but its damn detailed.    It doesnt answer my questions unfortunately. What happens after the timeline does abe 12345 cease to exist like wiki says or some other possibility? And if they do how is the end possible?   It doesnt touch on my 2nd and 3rd questions. For that matter not even the 4th or 5th but i realize the last two questions are most likely unanswerable to 100% certainity.      I feel like im missing something here, thats obvious im just not grasping.   SPOILERS     According to wiki, once the original version passes the loop he ceases to exist and the traveller continues. How does the end make sense in this logic?     Assuming wiki is wrong, Aaron travels back to change the party 20 times or more, shouldnt there be 20 or more versions?     Abe tells aaron in the airport dont force me to use the power i have, what is he referring to?     What do they do with comatose Grady?      How do they keep the versions of themselves locked in the attic, why can the wife or SO hear rat like noises?      Will say Great movie, watched it earlier today 1st time and have been spending time trying to piece it together. Through reddit and google. Any help with these questions would be appreciated     EDIT: LOL messed up the title...bad, didnt notice till now.   You keep throwing around insults, falsifying stats, and the whole time completely missing the point of the thread. Its not a thread about tattoos effect on you getting a job, which you keep bringing up. Its comical to epic proportions your bias against tattoos and your judgement of those who have them. Made quite clear by you trolling this thread that has nothing to do with the bias points you are failing to make, NOTHING. Make your own thread to hate on, or stay on the topic at hand, but either way im appalled by your bias and amused at your ignorance on the subject. Hope you dont act like this in public....   Yea i thought it might have been from the song "for your life". That other quote is great from "no quarter" my favorite zeppelin song.   Yea you would have to know a song, simply putting can in doesnt bring them up    Its jamming   You are not focusing properly imo then   I dont even see them on youtube   Damn this is for your life?   Hell yeah thats great, from "Thank you"   My fav is "Squeeze my lemon till the juice runs down my leg" The lemon song   I like that, achilles last stand?    EDIT: battle of evermore   I like a wide range mostly genres of rock. I love allman bros, zeppelin, sabbath, iron maiden, govt mule, Stp, dream theater, etc      I will, im familar with the other bands you name so if its anything similar im sure ill dig it   Does it stand for something?   Yea i can respect that. I feel like that with paranoid by sabbath. I think most of that comes with both those albums are so over played   What is can?   Agreed except id go Wish you were here, Animals, Dark side. Meddle being a 9/10. Animals is so underrated, so damn good.   Edge of tomorrow. Ive tried 4-5 times, its so boring.  	105
 Way to go buddy! What life you've had there!      I admit I also read it a couple of times before totally understanding the story. And when you do, you'll really appreciate the novel. Maybe reading still depends on the interest of the reader. I for one cannot get the hang reading the likes of Robert Kiyosaki.    I wonder how far can technology go. And can human catch up? What's next after nano-?   They should have found an alternative long ago considering the vast profit that they have amassed from their patrons (meaning the loyal children who begged their parents for this very expensive toy). That is if they were really concerned about the welfare of many and not just for their own personal gains.       Reading is good for everyone, so I am happy when there's a new recruit. And to add to your future reads, 'Brothers Karamazov' by Dostoyevsky is a good one.    Leave it as it is. History is imprinted on it already. Just create a copy and put color on it instead. Sometimes, we do more harm than good on things that should have been left alone.      They should have done that a long time ago instead of spending more of their national funds on nuclear power plants which they know are harmful to their people.                  	15
 I love fantasy, like "Final Fantasy Advent Chrildren".  I do not really dig children's movies. They are better as cartoons I think.    So for your time on Earth you believe that is the only meaningful achievement?   I struggle to find meaning in life and I wonder if having children would make me feel the same.    Lucky you. But you are also not looking forward to it, are you?   Sorry to be difficult. I just want to understand why you think that.   I personally think it should be like this:  As an example:  at 8:00am the machine starts and you can see it because it has not yet left - here we all have the same understanding  at 8:01am you are still standing in the room, for you, 1 minute has passed. For the traveler (assuming he is traveling at 60x speed) 1 second has passed but still at 8:01am both of you are still in the room.   at 9:00am it is still the same. 1 hour has gone by for you, for the traveler 1 minute went by, but both of you are still in the room.   This is the case for every second of every minute of every hour. Both of you are always in the room at the same time. It is not like for the time traveler a "different universe is opening" and he is travelling through an alternative time. Same universe, same time, just at different speeds.  Please explain why I should not be able to see him?    You do believe there is something (whatever it may be) after death though?   I am scared of dying. I wonder if religious people are too.    I also considered that point. However, I do not think it does though, because when he travels, the changes around him actually have an influence on the machine (it is moving backwards and forwards whilst he is travelling because something is happening to the ground, if I remember correctly).  What do you think?   I don't think it would because you are not stationary in time. You are also moving through time, as is the machine. The same way for the traveler everything outside the machine is moving fast, for other people the traveler should be moving slow.    As the machine is travelling to the future, it is still always in the same place. Therefore whoever is standing next to it should be able to see it because it is not instantly going to the new time, but just moving through time faster. The passenger should only appear to be moving slower depending on the speed the time machine is travelling at.    What's the surprise? They didn't know how much chocolate milk they were selling?    Nobody crops. Please tell people album covers are square.    Of course   Vielleicht sind die ja auch nur da um ihr Beileid zu bekunden.   That doesn't mean you can make such a stupid comparison. If you can't compare size because you don't know it, measure LTE browsing time for the S5 and compare that.   I didn't click that link first but after reading your comment I was curious. It's really funny. Why wouldn't I choose the facetime HD camera over shitting 2.1MP?      Do you not think they might be joking? They are probably bored and just say whatever to see how far they can take this shit    I agree with what you say. But seriously, and 14 year old girl talking like that clearly has no idea what she is talking about. She's just arrogant I think.   I am sure    He's going to resign soon I guess...   Edit:...  going to be forced to...    How do you normally get there?   Could you be so kind and also answer these questions:  Why does sleep refresh us?  Why do we die without sleep?   What else goes wrong if we don't sleep?       She sounds lovely    Hai, pleasu join, onegaishimasu.   I don't get the question. How does a time machine enable me to have sex with whoever I want?    people wonder why the mainstream muslims don't come out against it   Could you elaborate this point? I am very interested because my colleague said exactly this. But I don't understand why.   Always Sunny in Philadelphia   Accuse them of rape.   I am sure it is something where I criticize  gun laws in America.    Colonel Jack O'Neill together with Daniel Jackson.   I have learnt so much about compassion, ethics and leadership from them. I fucking love them   Not a movie, but Lost was so disappointing.   I wear socks, underwear and a t shirt with [this](http://www.threadless.com/imgs/products/1759/636x460design_01.jpg) on it.   And I can bring a bottle of Japanese sake, a cup for the sake and Shiroi Koibito (Japanese biscuits).   I would love to see myself standing in the corner of a party like this.   I don't want to have it, like regularly, but I really would like to have it once, just to know.  Do you mind trying to explain?   No thank you...   Integrity. The rarest thing on the planet   Reading all of this, I hope that my parents spend all their money while they are alive so me and my family never have to fight over anything. It's so not worth it.   is it the first time or is it not?         I do. I don't want to support this BS. Please give a fuck.  And I am also a business traveller. I also don't pay extra for priority boarding and all this crap       Pretty impressive. I wonder if the guy survived Auschwitz.    He is just saying that they did survive and that they took a calculated risk. I saw one of the guys in an interview. He said that cancer would most likely take longer to develop than he will live. That is why he went in.      I don't care whether you are right or wrong. Just please get your "their"s and "there"s right    Go to Germany. The degree is for free, teachers are respected, well paid and I know many who are very happy.  I swear, America is going down the drain and this is just one sad example    Hence my question. Do you have any examples that prove me wrong?    They just do. I think it's just a thing that never changed. You know, people grow up with them and get used to it.  In the UK they have separate taps for hot and cold. Socks, but it only changes very slowly.    I'm from Germany so I rely on newspapers to get information about the US. The Spiegel had an article explaining that the first high speed train is constantly being postponed because the republicans oppose it.  And at the end there was an additional comment claiming that the republicans oppose any form of government help to strengthen the infrastructure of the US.   I hope you can understand.       Yeah I'm gonna buy one but will go for an all in one option. Aux in use and Bluetooth is less expensive than I thought.      Yes it does. Thank you. I guess I'll just get one with high ratings on amazon then    This would be perfect but I do not have a stereo with aux in. I currently have a tape deck...  Could use one of those fake tapes with a 3.5mm headphone jack. Haha  Anyway thank you. I would actually buy that if I already had the stereo    I use spotify and here maps. I was wondering if anybody can recommend a car stereo (single slot) that would be able to connect with my phone (in whatever way) so that I can hear music and directions over the speakers of my car.  If I would be able to change the song using the stereo rather than the phone, that would be really nice.   I want to ask a question but you might not like it. I'm gonna give it a go anyways.  I don't know you so I can't tell whether I like you as a person. But I can safely say that now you look really good, healthy and active. Before you looked, let's say different.  How do you feel about the difference in attention people are giving you? I'm gonna assume (again without knowing your personality) that before you did not get much attention, if any. I'm sure you loads now and compliments as well.   I read lots about overweight people saying that they are invisible to other people. What is your experience? Now that people give you attention (again an assumption) do you feel they are superficial?  I don't want to forget to say "well done". It must have been incredibly tough but also rewarding.    So, this post is supposed to be a tool to make calculating food and drinks for parties easier. The purpose is to avoid having to think about it. If it does not do that, it's useless.   Do you never use a calculator?    All at the same time or what?  Edit: got it. Sorry    So then it's useless. If I have to think there is no value in this.   I like to complain by the way...    That is a good explanation.    I know. I am surprised so many people seem to agree.    I did watch it. And it is good to know that. But I am more concerned about turbulence and the plane simply dropping down.    Just saw this today:  http://www.androidcentral.com/sony-roll-out-lollipop-xperia-z3-lineup-starting-next-month   Just saw that they now announced February.   So, that's sorted then. Next question?   Cool. Thanks   Analog pictures just look way cooler than digital ones.  Edit: The ones taken casually of course.   And that centre of mass would be your mum.  Boom!   If they do it better than all the others I don't mind the wait    I don't know why the guys answer as if no decent guy does that. I think I'm a decent guy but I do that. I think it's just because guys don't regularly need it and therefore don't understand that a girl's wants it.    Fuck as many women as you can. It's true.    Peel first? I want to get it right the first time. Thank you in advance    Have you got more information like this? I am super scared of flying and have to do it for my job all the time. You would really do me a favour.    I am assuming the gif stops there because the plane simply drops, right?   I can only say that I agree. I have not found a single app I like yet and the articles I can find online contain mostly to do lists and games (which I am both not interested in)   When can I expect 5.0 for z3 compact? Have they announced anything?   I can't believe how much the colour of the light sabre changes the feeling I get from the poster.   * With the blue it feels like the Jedi are back in charge * The green makes me feel like the empire is still in charge and the jedi are still rebels.   I have got no explanation.  Does anybody else feel the same?   Lenovo yoga pad 2    Frying chocolate bars.   That is true    If you do that you have two halves of a windows tablet that do not work anymore.   Just saying...   I'm on mobile but   Lucio Dalla - Anna e Marco   Is the best.   You are donating 10%?  I donate 18 per month and thought that was ok.   Surely not right now. They will wait for the beginning of the second half to see how it's going. Also who is there who could do a better job?   Same here. The feet looked disgusting before and now really clean and healthy.  I would be so happy about that   I don't think this answers the question. The grocery store could just lower the price then. People would find it more competitive and would buy more fruit etc.  But that doesn't happen.   I'm a German living in the UK and I always thought windows in the UK are smaller than in Germany.   Also, double glazing seems to be special in the UK. In Germany we are now talking about quadruple glazing.  My point? I don't have one...       Really? They sound really nice...  NICHT   I'm just curious: when do they say it? I find it hard to imagine a situation in which it makes sense to say that. Or do they literally say it as soon as they find out you're German?    So important.   Accused does not mean he/she actually did anything. It's the same with rape: If you are a rapist, go to hell. But if you are falsely accused of rape, then I really hope people will be reasonable and judge you based on facts and evidence.    Buy a Samsung phone and make sure to choose that whistling notification sound on max volume. Then start a text conversation on the bus during your morning commute.    Always say how shit and boring other people's weekends sound but never actually do anything yourself.   I am trying to explain it to my little brother because I think it is one of the most important things on earth. But I can't explain it easily.    Our products are sold into the oil and gas and chemical industry and we buy auxiliary equipment from UK suppliers (amongst others).  Their products are ok, but their performance is terrible.   Oil and gas and chemical industry.   Honestly, I work with exactly these companies. They are not top notch and their performance is way behind the rest of Europe. People always say that they are doing badly because the government is focusing on the city. From my point of view English manufacturing is dead because they use obsolete machines, their are lazy and they are arrogant    What are some easy and worth it measures?   Had to read that a few times    Either:  a) my German family and friends when they come to visit and want to bring something back.  b) I work for a Japanese company and we have got lots of people from Japan coming over all the time. They always want to bring some high value gift home for their wives.    People ask me all the time and I do not really know what to say apart from tweed jackets.   I had one when I was a child and I so sure my parents would have not spent 100 on a child's watch.  Now I see that they range from 100 -6000.  What did I miss?   I really like how you explained this. Very easily to understand    They have like 100 stores in London    I hate every single Starbucks because they are never clean. Nobody in there wipes the tables, floor, or cleans the toilet.  It's disgusting. I can't eat/drink something in a place so dirty   I wonder what they have been promised to do that.    The issue with their profits is not that they do not make any at all. They keep them low by paying a franchise fee to the starbucks mother ship in the Netherlands. That means the starbucks coffe shops make no profit, because they have to pay a high franchise fee. Therefor they do not pay any tax on their profit here. Star bucks in the Netherlands however makes huge profit but as far as I know the tax level is ridiculously low there (plus they employ several legal tricks to keep it low).   In conclusion, they problem is that they are evading tax in a legal way. It is legal, but unethical.      I think people would buy their way on it though.    I always wonder if that is true. Is it true or are some people just better than others? Personally I believe the latter.   You really need to share some more information.   Also, but that might only be me, I do not understand why it says 1 day and 10 hours on battery when you have charged about 10 times.   He fell asleep again, didn't he?  I want an answer to this question.    I have never considered that. Thank you.    Nope, all old ads. Thank you for trying.     Never say never   My auntie gave it to me for my birthday. It broke and I want it back really bad:  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nike-Unisex-Lebron-Bracelet-WL0008-003/dp/B000813CLA  Where can I buy it?      That is what I sometimes think too.   It is really sad.   Talking about ~~their~~ American foreign debt:  American foreign debt is in US Dollars, because it's the currency the entire world uses. If people would ask for their money back, America could just print money. It would fuck up the exchange rate but that would also make all the money people would get back worthless so nobody will ever start doing it. It would be a lose-lose situation.   	120
 That's [Ward Kimball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Kimball) making those faces.  Great pic, thanks   **More** knowledge-can't get enough. Thanks.

He said "We weren't a bunch of four F'ers and joined up as soon as we were old enough."   Dad wouldn't talk about the war. All he would say about it was "I did my duty". After he died I found an Air Medal (Bronze Star) with a couple oak leaves. No luck finding out why he got them.  After the war he and Mom lived in Germany as part of the occupation but she hated it. He would never fly again but always loved aircraft and worked for Lockheed for the rest of his career. Again, he would never say what he did and was usually out in Palmdale.  Mom would never talk about the war, either. I believe they both went through some very bad stuff. She only went back home once, 50 years later, for a visit and it was utterly foreign to her, although she was proud of being French and never became an American citizen.

Gastroenterologists usually perform the procedure, so the availability of specialty care may be a barrier.  All persons with a first degree relative (i.e. Mom, Dad, Brothers, Sisters)  with colon cancer are at increased risk and should have a colonoscopy every five years. The procedure is done with conscious sedation; one is not unconscious, but is unaware and cannot recall the procedure if the anesthesia is done properly. The most unpleasant part of the test is drinking stuff that makes you poop until the colon is cleaned out so the colon can be visualized.  Most colon cancer starts out as a small bump called a polyp that takes many years to become an invasive cancer so there is plenty of time to find them and remove them, thus preventing cancer.

While the enemy was hammering at the Marines' defensive positions, Sgt. BASILONE, in charge of 2 sections of heavy machine guns, fought valiantly to check the savage and determined assault. In a fierce frontal attack with the Japanese blasting his guns with grenades and mortar fire, one of Sgt. BASILONE'S sections, with its gun crews, was put out of action, leaving only 2 men able to carry on. Moving an extra gun into position, he placed it in action, then, under continual fire, repaired another and personally manned it, gallantly holding his line until replacements arrived. A little later, with ammunition critically low and the supply lines cut off, Sgt.

 My reply:   That is quite a quandary. Opportunity breeding decisions. You can save local businesses by reserving eggs for them or you can use the money to invest in people who follow your model (I know you aren't interested in personally expanding). Either of those takes people coming to you and being honest with their finances and goals - and you have to be sure of their honesty and integrity. I think you will be able to do both by riding the wave for people and places which do not come to you for help (or do not warrant it), but letting some partake reduced prices. The only sour point there is those who see a double standard or are turned away not be humble enough to understand. If that seems insurmountable, take the money and invest it in more farms.

Any fun stories about moving to a town before you found out it was in trouble?   There is living and then there is delaying death, I guess.      True.

I haven't seen Tomorrowland, yet, but I can wonder why there are no bathroom cleaners. Automation relieved society of the need for that particular menial task.  Automation currently removes the demand for jobs like airline receptionists and secretaries, people who just punch tickets and register information. A user interface and networked customer information system automated 95% of the job, so we can do the last 5% by typing in some info and swiping our card. There is still demand because a human touch is still more agile than a human's code.  It isn't like people are pre-destined to be low-skilled workers (not that I think anyone thinks that, anymore). Automation can also make it easier to live independently for people who might fall into those tasks today and the many that did, previously. People both fall into those tasks and life is not made easier through automation for various reasons which we may not entirely disagree on.  Did the movie preclude that in some way?

Do you mean this definition?   a system of cultivation intended to maintain permanent agriculture or horticulture by relying on renewable resources and a self-sustaining ecosystem.     Fair enough, but that is as hippy-dippy as it gets.  People who engage with this design ethic have increased quality and profits at the same time. Joel Salatin has a well-known example of an extremely successful operation. Mark Shepard documented how he was raking in cash while his plow and corporate seed monoculture neighbors were suffering. There is a good example of an orchard which bucked the norm and did a few things: stopped spraying, diversified cultivars, and increased biodiversity in the orchard; this orchard was a hobby until he did this and it turned a profit. This isn't some get rich quick thing, these are prominent examples which took years to figure out the pieces and fit them together correctly. I can link you to short youtube videos which pertain to each of the mentioned people.  [Here's a big compendium I have](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLISQy9l1YUlDY19LDABGMC4I4qjhR4pV) - and a [headliner playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLISQy9l1YUkScuUq0l6qUov7tj8Vmt8I)  edit: fixed headliner link   I was watching and I noticed that they haven't stopped consuming, they just compact the inert waste.  The sustainability some people desire (like Paul Wheaton of Wheaton Labs) is to make the supply train as responsible as possible. This prevents permanent contaminants even coming onto the property. He's practical, but he has a goal to not even have synthetic paints and gasoline vehicles at the first circle of habitation.   Certainly are an interesting bunch. Ted has spent an awful lot of time thinking, that is evident.   Agriculture has the etymology agri+culture. Agri meaning sky (as in, open fields); culture meaning exactly what we think. Since this is a movement which has found plowing (widely considered a sign of civilization) as detrimental to perpetual habitation, the founders thought a direct challenge and contrast was fitting. Hence perma was substituted for agri. Perma meaning just what you'd expect. All they mean is that this is a design ethic which is meant to find the best way to create a permanent, non-cyclic and non-self-destructive, way of enabling human settlement and life.    I think the author refers to the people that founded the movement by name; he mentions Bill Mollison. If you read the article again, you'll see the most astute permaculturists insist that the market is a part of life.  Permaculture is just like applying the ideas of human action to each part of an endeavor. "What behaviors, inputs, and outputs does a chicken have?" Then you give it what it needs and use its behaviors and outputs to their best use. Chickens are omnivores and scratch the dirt, so many systems elect to run cows over pasture and follow with chickens. The chickens eat flies for protein and spread the manure. They also eat different greens that grow in the meadow.  Permaculture is a design system, not a lifestyle or save the planet cult.  If you want to know more, let me know.   One tap no, two taps yes.   I can see him in there, but he ain't movin   Even he has skeletons in closets, and his are under-age.   So he is saying that the government collecting money is not violence, but that money will go to private hands instead of somehow the government doing everything internally down to mining the raw ore and farming is violence.   Permaculture, Strong Towns, and American Libertarianism are three of my interests which are intersecting in this article.  From what I know of permaculturists, many are mostly anti-political rather than anti-liberty.      I agree.  Permaculture, Strong Towns/ Lean Urbanism/ New Urbanism, and American Libertarianism are three of my interests which are intersecting in this article.  The idea of a responsible supply chain is very interesting. It recognizes externalities of various kinds, empowering journalists and academics to monitor the modern goods and services and supports paying the costs up front which would otherwise be deferred to pollution or human strife.  Come to think of it, /r/keto also intersects, here, because if Allan Savory and Dr. Peter Attia are both right there is a very obvious solution.   Woohoo! More Shriners in tiny cars!   The secret is, we ruined all our beaches a hundred years ago.   You know what I like about a parade? Hearing the drums of the band getting closer and closer. The brass and cymbals coming into range and slowly getting more clear. The sound of a band coming changes if you are in a small town, or near a park or pond, or nestled in the canyon of a city center's skyscrapers. The echo and reverberation can confuse the distance. Then the band comes around the corner and you hear the real power of a marching band.  I enjoy the sight and smell of old cars, hot rods, firetrucks, and military surplus rolling down the street. I enjoy seeing the community and trade groups because they show the vibrancy of a town. I enjoy seeing the Shriners race miniature cars to delight children. I'm not a fan of having children ride floats in parades - it isn't where the children want.  You know what I didn't like about a parade, once? I walked in front of the Macy's Day Parade one year and being in NYC before and after the parade was the worst part, everything else was ok. The Macy's freight elevator was filthy (if you haven't been in the belly of an American city, you don't know what I mean) and we were accosted by the unfortunate mentally handicapped who are homeless on the streets.  A parade is a hopeful thing when done right, but it is easy to do wrong. I don't like watching the Macy's Day Parade because it is done wrong. It isn't personable and it isn't for the person on the street. You can't televise a parade - not the real parades. How long can a parade really be?  People don't like parades because some parades are done wrong. Keep it short. One band in front, one near the back. Have marshals to keep the pace; don't rely on stopping and starting. Only kids who are directly involved should be in the parade; no idle wavers, even in float contests. Idle wavers subtract from the audience. The last piece in a parade should always be obvious, and possibly traditional. Cities still have to keep it short and should consider neighborhood or district parades.   You never know *which* tree will grow to be 1000yrs old. Most of them are specimens from forests which grew for thousands of years before the seed from that tree even fell, making a perfect habitat for the future giant.   Stop. My jaw can only drop so low.   A good piece of advice goes:   Successful people do everyone else's job, too.  This works in most job environments, but doesn't in customer service. *How can you be a good customer so the customer doesn't have to be?*  Isn't that part of product development?  New corollary:   Successful people do not work in jobs where they cannot perform everyone else's job, too.  Don't work in customer service unless you are fine with no internal advancement.   Is there a difference between Republicans and Democrats you'd like to defend?   sure.  Anyway, in government, management has problems dealing with corruption so the effect would be limited.

Red and slightly puffy, itchy but forgettable, and lasts for weeks. Seems to appear above the diaphram and below or between the pectoral muscles/ adipose deposits. All in all not fun, but I can't say that is what you are experienceing for sure and I have not found a way to end the reaction faster. I also have no idea what a protein allergy can do to your kidneys, if anything.  I can tell you that I survive instances without cortisol because if there is one thing I hate more than an itch it is a smelly, sticky undershirt.  Check your recent diet for new types of dietary proteins you may have eaten.   It wouldn't be impossible to turn that into a nice place to live.   I think you need to modify that to "*survivable without continued investment.*"   I would rather have my pay up front than promised. That is the trade-off.  Do you think I mean keep the pay the same and take away the benefits? One of the best solutions for healthcare is to end plans tied to employers.   Oh, so you are agreeing with me when I said:   Well, it might help bad management if they hired someone who would fix the internal issues instead of begging for more cash to throw away.  Cool. Sorry, I thought since you were making the same argument I was you were making another argument. But mine wasn't terribly clear.   A failure is to offer benefits in the first place, regardless whether public or private.   Please, explain how adding money reduces corruption in government.   Well, I'm not going to write five pages, single-spaced for us to be on the same page so I suppose I'll settle for head trauma.   Much complaint over what seems to be a fluid situation, with even the Conservative party agreeing on some faults though not the overall idea of privatization. If one considers the action of privatization a government action (this one certainly was) it can be said the same level of success has been seen as is normally achieved in any other government program.     This is the case across the globe.  Only because if any private company pops up it either has to attach itself to government money, serve a segment not able to get government support, or die.  How can anyone compete with endless money, and why would you improve once you get that money?   I can imagine how we have no idea how great security services could be if the sector didn't have to compete with the endless pockets of government.   The take-away from that should be that those companies don't need subsidies. You should look and see who owns the roads, too (government). So let's say almost all methods of major transport accept government money.  Why are we doing that? There are myriad reasons we are in this state, but the effect is to make travel less expensive for the less wealthy because taxes are progressive, right?  Two things to say to that: some people think the tax structure isn't progressive enough and these companies have made their services more expensive because once you get into the pen the trough of government money overfloes.  Cut off the money.   And? If the government is going to do that, then it doesn't deserve to have control of the assets. That is how I treat all government powers.   I might call that a failure.  We gonna start evading the Amtrak issue now that I brought up the post office?     it is clear that privatization leads to slack rather than efficiency.      The post office is rather well run.  Sometimes it doesn't matter how well run something is if it fills the demand poorly and I hesitate to call it well run at the deficits it carries yeat-to-year.   He didn't say "close it down and tear up the tracks."   You're just making claims without evidence.   People wonder what is eating America out from the inside? Infrastructure costs being unresolved by local taxes. Developers not building mixed, truly walkable, communities. Government not giving up on owning something when it fails (post office, Amtrak, etc.).  Amtrak was a corporate bailout from the start. We don't want bailouts, right? So it was a bad decision to begin with!  Now we've got this company that America treats like a toy train set. Grow up.  ninjaedit: I'm not saying "grow up" to /u/crackron   Giving Amtrack more money doesn't solve passenger trains using the same tracks as cargo, road-level crossings, corruption and overpaid workers, or bad management.  Well, it might help bad management if they hired someone who would fix the internal issues instead of begging for more cash to throw away.      However there are cultural aspects and subgroups which are "shitty."  Pickpockets, actual ghettos, and institutionalized corruption and misogyny. These exist - not to say they are always prevalent.

My biggest complaint is schools collect data "anonymously" but the companies have access to the list that attaches identities to "anonymous" personal identification numbers.  Data collection is better in aggregate, but certainly not by individual child.   Teachers should be involved enough, smart enough, and not over-burdened enough to give feedback to the companies. If they want to put out books students can access via secure app on private computers and devices for homework, that would be fine. Then they could fix errors and typos without reprinting.   There is a structure called a [*garconniere*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gar%C3%A7onni%C3%A8re). I know it from southern plantations.

If she cares about these people so much, maybe she will listen to them.   The [wiki page for Dust Bowl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl) supports this view. I think one of the more accessible (and short) works which gives more detail is [*Dirt: Erosion of Civilizations*](http://smile.amazon.com/Dirt-Civilizations-David-R-Montgomery-ebook/dp/B007V2D4JO) by David R. Montgomery.  If there had been record rains instead of record drought, the dirt would have washed away. Just like Boston received red snow, the floods would have been red with soil. Montgomery has good information on how early American farming practices caused massive gullies in the Carolinas and northern Georgia around the time of the Civil War. Thankfully, the seed drill and cover cropping has resolved the most extreme negative effects of agriculture on soil. - it is still odd to think that the plow has probably killed more people than the sword through instgating droughts, floods, and famines.

Putting on my amateur urban planning cap, I will agree with your second sentence.  However, car transport is bankrupting America. Small towns and cities alike cannot impose the taxes necessary to provide adequate upkeep for suburbia's low- density sprawl. It is taking a long time to make people realize this (mostly because they haven't needed to care).   yeah, we'd have to use an even cooler word. It would go right along with "incarnate," "consubstantial," and such.

But, seriously, some people have reported that their 4pm drop in awareness and energy is avoided on the Keto diet.

NU used political structures and developer relationships to modify sections of the built environment (or build them from scratch, more often); LU tries to fix existing areas (not precluding redevelopment) by relaxing and eliminating regulatory and zoning ordinances. There isn't supposed to be a difference in community involvement, but instead of the process in NU being driven by the town or city, in LU it is driven by developers big and small. the idea is to set up a system of [guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl0hMfqNQ-g) which everyone can use to build a cohesive and healthy town or city rather than the NU way of master-planning everything. The small business owner isn't squished quite as much this way and the process becomes an opportunity for good design and planning principles to take over in a town or city, rather than political squabbling and cronyism.

 I've done a game vs AI on the slowest time to make the timings perfect and 9 Overlord is the best.   If it's in the early game, make some extra queens. They have a good anti-air attack and can transfuse. This can also be used against ZvZ if they go mutas. Just make a couple spores around the mineral lines and spread creep between your bases. 2-3 queens per base should do it. If they are massing them, they should have very low defenses through the mid game, so a nice roach hydra infestor (with neural parasite) should work. Don't forget range and carapace upgrades!   [You got me.](http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/oh-you-show.jpg)   1. I hotkey; 1-All Hatches,, 2,3,4-Queens respectively,, Mouse 1-Units,, Mouse 2-Special units (Broodlords, infestors, ect...) 2. Initial scout I use drone, otherwise just run a couple lings in. With ZvP watch out for dark shrine, stargate, or mass zealots. Zerg only has an overseer and spores, I prefer overseer, so don't wait too long for lair upgrade. Also, if the Toss goes Vrays just make 2 extra queens and don't forget to connect bases with creep. With ZvZ scout early for an early pool. Other than that, ZvZ consists of making good engagements and mirroring what your opponent is doing. 3. Creep spread isn't too important, but if you want to add queens or hydras into your army, creep helps those units get into batter easier. 4. If you are going against a Toss that is FFE, then take your 3rd around 5-6 minutes if you see no aggression while scouting. Otherwise, I just take my third when I see that my 2nd is almost saturated. 5. Hydras are good units if they are used correctly. Common unit compositions are roach/hydra, and infestors can be added. A very strong mid-game if engagements are used correctly. They are DPS units so make sure they are behind your roaches, and don't forget the grooved spines upgrade which adds +1 range. 6. 2 fungals kill workers, but fungals do not do overlapping damage so make sure that the fungal is almost complete before a second is casted. I believe marines are 3 fungals, I would test it but I'm in class right now. I realize that this response is kind of late, but I figured it might help out someone.   Get the surround. Have units on all sides of engagement. Quickly run lings to the outsides for a flank while the meat of your army (roach, infestor, etc..) attack from the front. The Protoss will have fun with those forcefields. Also a good strategy against colossus if you don't have corruptors yet.  	5
 If you're looking for specific literature I'd recommend Lucifer Rising by COS Reverend Gavin Baddeley.   http://www.amazon.com/Lucifer-Rising-Book-Devil-Worship/dp/0859652807     Peter Gilmore writes about how music influences him in the Satanic Scriptures. He comes from a orchestral music background, so he lists those composers and pieces that inspire him. If you're interested in hearing his own work he made much of it available for free here: http://www.churchofsatan.com/music-peter-h-gilmore.php   Was LaVey the perfect father? Probably not. So what? Read the article. Her grievances can be summed as "daddy didn't give me enough attention. He was such a selfish asshole" Funny how she was perfectly happy with her family situation *exactly* up to the point where father told her "no, you and your nutty boyfriend aren't getting the Church of Satan." She then ran off and joined up with Aquino, obviously looking for another father figure. When Aquino told her "no, you're not getting the Temple of Set" she ran off again and found Buddha.   Satanism is also inherently anti-egalitarian, advocates hierarchy, private property, and yes, the rule of law. "Thats why I believe in stratification by allowing water to seek its own level. Its something that can, and is, being done. Im all for a police state; no messing around. There should be an armed guard on every street corner. The Israelis have the right idea: school bus drivers and MacDonalds managers carrying Uzis." Like I said, you're going to have a lot of caveats.      "At the time of his death LaVey was embroiled in a number of personal controversies. He had also acquired a number of competitors who wanted to discredit him.  This meant that a cottage industry arose in material which painted LaVey in the worst possible light.  Accordingly, people close to Anton LaVey tend to be instinctively wary when questioned: people who hated him are only too happy to share their grievances.  I have no desire to write a salacious tell-all, especially since LaVey's life doesn't appear to have been all that salacious.  (He's certainly got nothing on transvestite meth-head priests).  I won't hide unflattering information if it is important to his work, if it sheds light on his philosophy or influence. But I'm primarily concerned with his failings insofar as they shed light on his accomplishments.  Tragic flaws interest me: petty ones not so much. " http://kenazfilan.blogspot.com/2013/01/satanism-story-of-reluctant-antichrist.html   You say you're looking for unbiased look at the Church of Satan but you've been seemingly disturbed by the claims of extremely biased individuals. The people that spread that whole "pimping" claim were people who were trying to discredit LaVey after his death so that they could lay claim to the COS and his royalties. As for the whole "cannibalism" thing, so what? There was the old prank that LaVey would pull on house guests, where he would serve "long pig" (thigh of woman). This was obviously a joke, even LaVey/COS detractor Aquino claims it was a joke. Whatever his own personal experiences are, that's just it, his own personal experiences. As /u/JasonUncensored properly stated, LaVey is no hero, never claimed to be, and told people *not* to worship him. "Satanism demands study, not worship!"    Writer Kenaz Filan is currently working on an unbiased biography of LaVey and the early Church of Satan. You can follow his work at his blog here: http://kenazfilan.blogspot.com/search/label/satanism       As a Satanist I'm a pure materialist and shun the spiritual all together. So from a theological stand point I have very little interest in Gnosticism. That said, I do find value in Gnostic art and symbolism and feel comfortable using it for purely emotional and aesthetic purposes.   In theory, yes. But that does not mean many Satanists would agree with your political views, you're more likely to run into people who are at the opposite end of the political spectrum. Any political ideology that leans heavy on collectivism would have hard time synergizing with Satanism's extreme individualist philosophy. I know several Satanists who hold Egoist Anarchist ideals (myself included), but wouldn't be fond of any of Social Anarchism's collectivist theories. LaVey was very open about saying that [Satanism **is** Americanism](http://news.churchofsatan.com/post/26500106054/a-horned-salute-on-independence-day). Does that mean you need to fall in line and agree? Not necessarily, but don't be surprised if you find yourself in constant conflict. That said, there are plenty of Satanists who go their way independently, applying the philosophy as they see fit.            Here's a little Industrial Easter Egg in that group photo... notice the man kneeling on the right... the one and only David Tibet (Current 93).

Here's a list of Church of Satan related material:    http://churchofsatan.com/sources-print.php    If you want more of LaVey I would go right to The Devil's Notebook and Satan Speaks!, otherwise I would recommend Peter H. Gilmore's [Satanic Scriptures](http://www.amazon.com/Satanic-Scriptures-Peter-H-Gilmore/dp/0976403595/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-7850525-6432757?ie=UTF8 s=books qid=1182438419 sr=8-1/churchofsatan).   A clip of my interview with the producer starts at the 00:03:05 mark.      The Church of Satan was the first above-ground religious organization to fully and officially support and perform homosexual marriage. Magus Gilmore has continued this tradition and has been an outspoken critic of recent attempts by religious fundamentalists to ban same-sex marriage.    http://news.churchofsatan.com/post/23051214911/the-god-behind-the-curtain-by-magus-peter-h-gilmore    http://www.churchofsatan.com/founding-family-morality.php              Not sure where they got their sources for their ideas on the Church of Satan because they got a lot of that wrong. The Church of Satan does not merely believe Satanism is a philosophy, but absolutely takes the position that Satanism is a religion. The point is repeated multiple times in The Satanic Bible, in the online literature, and in our media representation.                That sounds reasonable. I knew a few people who would call "extended mind" phenomenon and the like "supernormal".    What? No they aren't. Rejection of afterlife, of heaven and hell, of a supernatural God and his kingdom. A rejection of any life after this one. Death as the great abstinence, the finality of conscious existence. There's no ambiguity about it.   The Satanist is pragmatic, motivated by rational self-interest. There are plenty of ways of emotionally, psychologically, and symbolically destroying a person who violates your space without resorting to unnecessary physical violence. Then again, sometimes you have to stand your ground, but be prepared to be responsible for the consequences.     if to be a Satanist *merely* means to emulate the meaning of the word Satan    No. That's part of it, but the rejection of the spiritual and ethereal is just as important, as well at the several other factors. Gnostic Christians are just that, Gnostic Christians.     [Dark ambient/ritual music is kind of my forte](http://www.radiofreesatan.com/category/chaossedated/), so here are a few recommendations.

Lesser magic: Yes. Greater magic: Maybe.     At its core, Greater Magic is theatrical and psychological drama. The purpose is to exercise your emotions and to let go of the psychological detritus that might be holding you back from enjoying your life or achieving your goals.    That said, there is room in the Satanic religion for the possibility that there may be some external influence that is a byproduct of Greater Magic. There are some Satanists who are interested in experimenting with that possibility, using rituals to exert their influence on others so to nudge events in their favor. Those Satanists may be interested in the works of the biologist Rupert Sheldrake, who describes such events as the "extended mind".    The Church of Satan does not require Satanists to "have faith" in this. If you are not interested or are skeptical of such phenomenon, that's fine. From the FAQ (http://churchofsatan.com/faq-ritual-and-ceremony.php):   We emphasize that the philosophy of the Church of Satan does not require that our members believe that ritual is more than an emotional experience, nor is there a mandate even to ritualize at all. We simply offer it as a tool for experimentation. Some folks have found results that they feel are beyond coincidence or statistical parameters. Others simply enjoy the release of emotions otherwise hindering their pursuit of personal happiness.    There is no judgment placed on members of the Church of Satan regarding their personal understanding of how ritual functions. One is not more or less of a Satanist based upon his or her evaluation of Greater Magic. See the essay, On the Role of Ritual in the Life of a Satanist by our High Priestess, Magistra Peggy Nadramia, for more information.       [Church of Satan - IN MEMORIAM H.R. GIGER (1940-2014 c.e.)](http://news.churchofsatan.com/post/85645835142/in-memoriam-h-r-giger-1940-2014-c-e)   Exactly, the Black Mass *is* a hateful, defamatory ritual. Hence the Catholics are in the right for opposing it and using their power to shut it down. That's why Black Masses are private rituals, used for private purposes, and if they're to be public then you better own up to the fact that you are the Bad Guys. It seems the Satanic Temple wants to have both ways, to use Satan's name for publicity, but hide behind victim-hood and cries of persecution when challenged, and use that victim mentality to get on their soapbox and proclaim themselves as the Good Guys. Go back the warm bosom of Wicca and underbelly of Buddha if that's your cup of tea.   Comments like this make me skeptical of your claims that this was an "authentic" ritual based on LaVey...     "And this we can and will do by violating the quietude of thy body, profaner of the ample vices, abstractor of stupid purities, cursed Nazarene, impotent king, fugitive god!

Edit: The Germans have a word for this: Fremdscham.      A polite, unoffensive Black Mass is pretty far from authentic.    I'll just reiterate this from a prior comment: With all their whitewashing of the ritual they should have called it the White Mass. The Black Mass is designed to be a psychological and symbolic attack, both at the senses of the participants and at the institutions themselves. The whole point is to rile up the senses, emotions, and to intentionally invoke a psychological break from the target subject.    With all their whitewashing of the ritual they should have called it the White Mass. The Black Mass is designed to be a psychological and symbolic attack, both at the senses of the participants and at the institutions themselves.   Also, the event was not private, it was public event that had fliers around the campus. Reservations were required but it was for all intents and purposes a promotional event.   Apparently their little Chinese restaurant retreat was an embarrassing crying victim circle jerk, surrounded by amused lounge employees.    I can't help but agree with /u/Paradoxinteractions. Le Messe Noir is openly a mockery and symbolic attack at Catholicism.     "This ritual is a psychodrama in the truest sense. Its prime purpose is to reduce or negate stigma acquired through past indoctrination. It is also a vehicle for retaliation against unjust acts perpetrated in the name of Christianity." - The Satanic Rituals    LaVey also advised the Church of Satan to take the idea of the Black Mass and apply it to institutions other than Christianity:   "A black mass, today, would consist of the blaspheming of such "sacred" topics as Eastern mysticism, psychiatry, the psychedelic movement, ultra-liberalism, etc. Patriotism would be championed, drugs and their gurus would be defiled, acultural militants would be deified, and the decadence of ecclesiastical theologies might even be given a Satanic boost." - The Satanic Bible     So when I heard first of these people doing a Black Mass I thought it was strange, considering that the express purpose of the Satanic Temple is to spread love and compassion.    Reports from the scene indicate that there weren't a whole lot of "Satanists" there to begin with, though they most likely didn't show up knowing that it was going to be canceled. The crowd had about a dozen protesters, but for the most part it was just curious onlookers. Pagans, atheists, liberal Christians, etc.    Bath salts.   Don't you think symbols and words have psychological and emotional power? Jung's Man and His Symbols is required reading for anyone wanting to explore this topic: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0440351839?pc_redir=1399608923 robot_redir=1   While LaVey dismissed much about occultists, he paid respect to the power of occult symbols and language. Here's LaVey on why he included the Enochian Keys: "Now you must know that every single occult scholar I knew warned me against publishing the Enochian Calls, saying that NOBODY touched upon them and it meant doom to even mention them. OK. That was enough for me. In they went. " (Forward to  Might is Right, 1996).   I'm not trying to shove my beliefs. OP asked for opinions and feedback on what the Satanic philosophy, as defined by LaVey, has to say about casual drug use. I provided the reasons and sources as to why such practices are not ideally Satanic. I didn't go knocking on someone's door telling them to put down the bong, they came to an open public forum asking for advice. For some reason my responses gave you some kind of anxiety.    Again, not every single thing a person does in their life has to meet the guidelines of Satanism. Make up your mind, be responsible for your own actions, including stepping outside of the parameters of the Satanic philosophy if you feel it necessary. But as a representative of the Satanism I'll continue to make a clear case so where those boundaries lie. Again, **rational** self-interest. Mindless hedonism is anti-Satanic.   In Satanism morality is subjective. There are some fundamental guidelines to the philosophy (Eleven Rules of the Earth, Nine Satanic Statements, etc.) but otherwise morals are subjective to the individual and cultural norms of the time. Edit: That's why I asked you those questions, in order to get context to the scenario you're describing. There is no objective morality in Satanism (i.e. looking after you fellow man), only a rational analysis based on self-interest.    I essentially agree, one can indulge intelligently and take responsibility for it. I still contend that such actions put the Satanist in a weaker position, vulnerable to suggestion or manipulation, but I suppose if done in private you save yourself that worry. But ultimately, as a policy stance, the Church of Satan will not condone any illegal activity or defend anyone found to be in violation of local laws.   You give me quotes from famous, exceptional people. Great! Those are **exceptional** people. They are unusual; not typical. I suppose that's the crux of our argument, I do not share your optimism in that these benefits would carry to the general population. Just like alcohol. What better way to gain an upper-hand in a negotiation then by passing them a drink. For the record, I would add that yes, drinking alcohol to the point of drunkenness is antithetical to the Satanic ideal, a "sin" LaVey himself committed, just like I'm sure he may have given unwanted advice at one time or another, and thought some people were capable of more than they were (solipsism). If the time comes that certain "soft" drugs are legalized, the same thing would apply. I'm sure Satanists would partake in their legal recreation, but they would be putting themselves in less than ideal Satanic states.   I've spent about a decade in the extreme metal and electronic music scenes in NYC and can attest to a number of rapes, fights, and near murders done under the influence of acid or the use of acid. Did these people have other influences in their lives, possibly more so than acid? Sure, just the same as I would say it's effect on successful people.   And then there's the research on psychedelic drugs as a tool for manipulating suggestibility. Are you saying that psychedelic drug do not influence your judgement? Because that's quite a bold statement. Now is this a good or bad thing? That's up to the individual and their own capabilities. It does not need justification, it is the logical conclusion of a set of principles. Now whether or not your see this as a flaw or you disagree, that's fine. This an aspect of Satanism you do not agree with, that's fine, you should feel comfortable with that if you are confident in your own experiences.     In the novel Venator operates inside the world of the Condor, who he opposes but realizes he needs to work within the system to live a free life. Through a series of manipulation, action, and stealth he achieves his ultimate freedom and shapes the world around him. Also read Peter Gilmore's Satanic Scriptures for a more directly Satanic take on the issue.     That's a fairly complex, and nuanced situation. I recommend reading Junger's novel Eumeswil. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumeswil   I doubt LaVey would dismiss Jobs as a slave, I believe he had a Mac himself. Steve Jobs, and the various people you mention, had their vices, and faults, and became the masters of their craft regardless, and like you say, maybe had some assistance. But do you think if they didn't have their innate talents and intelligence that LSD would have opened those doors for them? Does that make drug use beneficial as a general rule? How about instead of Steve Jobs we use the various murders committed while on LSD. One can argue that underlying mental illness is the cause of these murders, not LSD. Well, maybe it's the underlying genius of these individuals that got their achievements, not LSD. Can't have it both ways.  Again, I go back to what I said before, the "ideal" Satanist would not do drugs, therefore the philosophy does not condone drug use.    We're talking general use case here, since it's a general rule.   *Why is drug use so bad? Why is it looked down on so much in Satanism? What logical reason is there for this unusual closed mindedness?* Because, it impairs judgement and control, *generally*. Now, individually, one has to decide what they want to do with their talents and abilities in the privacy of their own homes and lives, but do not use the Satanic philosophy as justification for it. Is that clear enough?    When did I say he had "so many" people groveling at his feet? I stated a metaphor to clarify a point. Some people got their mutual desires (payment, sex, attention), some got more, some got less. Some took a paycheck and went about their business.    I think you under-represent the power of manipulation and suggestion if you think that money is the only thing that grants you what you need (source: Wolfe who would discover that LaVey had various cars at his disposal to use when he wished, though not directly owned by him). In any case, for all intents and purposes, LaVey made enough money to get the things he wants. Court records show he died with enough money and royalties for his various family members to fight over. Now, did he live and achieve his ultimate Satanic ideal? I think so, but that's separate debate. Jobs wasn't a Satanist, and he seems very compulsive and illogical at various times in his life. So? Not all rich people are Satanists, and not all Satanists are rich. Does that mean they're not content, or maybe they have just reasons to be angry and bitter?   I pay for people I can easily manage and dispose of all the time.    "Rational self interest", actually. Use your head and your own creativity. Figure it out. Peter Gilmore in the Satanic Scriptures actually goes into the scenario of living as a Satanist in a Nazi-like totalitarian regime and how one can go about that. Work it from within, and when you have the chance or desire, overthrow it, Might becomes Right. Or work way into it and become part of the ruling party. Find the third-side.    In essence, yes, you would now be operating outside of Satanic ideals. Does that mean you should or shouldn't do those things? That's up to you, but those are you own conclusions.   His conclusions are very logical, actually. If you take Satanism to its logical conclusions it demands that you are in complete control of your capacities and are a master of carnal materialism. Notice his choice of words, which he was very careful about... "true", "ideal"... he's talking about the Satanic philosophy in its logical, ideal form. Now, are all Satanists adhering to "ideal" Satanism at all times? No, not at all. Heck, I'd even say that LaVey himself had his missteps and faults. Blasphemy! But he lays out exactly what his Satanic philosophy and religion does and does not entail and the ideals it upholds. It's up to each individual Satanist to decide on how they want to approach their own situations, be it medical or recreational, but do not try to justify all their decisions with Satanism, because that's not going to always work.   Paying for slaves is an age-old tradition, isn't it? There will always be people who you could call worthless to their faces and will continue to grovel before you. LaVey has uses for them, and often referred to them as "House Masochists", or useful idiots.   I think you're confusing LaVey using and manipulating hippies for his own purposes with "hanging out".   I still enjoy some of his work but do not agree with much of what he believes in.    Satanism.   In an interview with Fox News he brushed it off as a phase he went through.   If a musician or artist wants to use drugs to help their creativity, then great, but that's not Satanic. And a Satanist could enjoy that art or music, but all that means is we're enjoying the products of that artist, hence they are serving as entertainment. Not everything needs to be Satanic, but it's important to understand what is and is not part of the philosophy.    He didn't "hang out" with Manson's groupies. You must be talking about Susan Atkins. Again, she was a slave and LaVey used her for what she was worth, eye candy. The only thing LaVey liked about Manson was that he killed hippie culture and put an gravestone end to the 60's.  "It was during this public prankish period that Anton held his Topless Witches Review at a San Francisco nightspot in North Beach. One of the girls he hired to emerge menacingly from her coffin as a vampire was Susan Atkins. Atkins was not yet involved with Charles Manson and it would be two years until she committed the murders in Sharon Tates Benedict Canyon home, licking the blood from her fingers after the deed. But in her post-conversion expose, Child of Satan, Child of God, Atkins indicts LaVey as the catalyst for her downfall. Anton remembers her as just another Haight Street burnout, perhaps a bit more drug-befuddled than some. Shed beg off rehearsals, saying she had a fever of 108. But in the end she made a fine vampire." - Secret Life of a Satanist   He later rejected it and dismissed it as a phase.   LaVey was alive in the 80's and was greatly amused by the chaos of the drugs war. In more or less words, "they had it coming".    Exceptional people are just that, exceptional. For every Steve Jobs there are thousands of slaves, he just became a master of them.   LaVey, a bonafide hippie basher:   1969: On August 8th, LaVey conducts a Hippie Ritual at the Church of Satan in which he bitterly curses the psychedelic vermin infesting the world. He calls for a purge to relegate the slaves to the pens in which they belong, catalyzing a new era of Satanic awareness. - Secret Life of a Satanist, Church of Satan documents.  And no, the "drug policy" is not just about hard drugs. Here is LaVey's directly addressing his thoughts on pot in specific:   "The fact that I do not agree with the currently popular hypothesis that marijuana is harmless (some say beneficial) is of little relevance here, for my general lack of sympathy for "martyred" pot devotees is actually a result of another of my "weird" or "crackpot" notions - that one should refrain from flouting the laws of his society, even if he considers some of them as repressive or unwarranted. So much for legal technicalities." - Letters from the Devil, 1972   You can believe whatever you want to convince yourself to believe, but LaVey did not do drugs or tolerate people who did.   "And then came the final flowering of the Drone: Hippies  the final de-evolution of man, to LaVeys mind  completely androgynous, convinced they were rebels against society (all 50,000,000 of them), and so zonked out on drugs they could no longer think for themselves or question anything that was fed to them (while they were all convinced of their individuality and uniqueness). What better way to make people vulnerable to attack than to pump mind-blowing drugs into them?" - Secret Life of a Satanist   Your assumption about the COS in the Sixties cannot be more wrong. One of the **reasons** behind LaVey starting Satanism and the Church of Satan was the mark the death to Hippie culture. He hated hippies and drug culture with incredible passion. LaVey did *not* hang out with hippies, it's been well documented (source: Randall Alfred, Burton Wolfe, various interviews) that LaVey kicked out marijuana-smokers, and a lot of the hippies in the San Fran area actually thought LaVey and the COS were way too conservative. The people who formed the early COS were lawyers, politicians, journalists, police officers, local judges, doctors... not a bunch of dudes in tie dye.     The anti-drug policy **is not PR**. It is core to the Satanic philosophy. Over and over and over since the 60's LaVey has stated how much he rejects drugs and drug culture, how much it is anti-Satanic,  how drugs are only useful for slaves. How much clearer can it be? This is nothing new, this has been on of the most consistent and plain as day fundamentals of Satanism.    Atheism is not a religion. One can be an atheist and still have a religion. Most Buddhists are atheists. Atheism means you do not believe in gods, that's all. That is a small, but important part of Satanism. On top of that are a series of dogmas, rituals, aesthetics, shared cultural values, holidays, symbols, metaphors, and philosophy. That's what makes Satanism an atheistic religion.       Is it acceptable in Satanism? No. Why are you looking for acceptance? See my quote above. Do what you want in private, but there's no justification for it under Satanism.   "Since there has much misinformation regarding the supposed use of drugs in Satanic ritual, clarification on that point is in order. The Church of Satan actively discourages the use of mind-altering (or behavior-influencing) drugs and the reliance upon physical or mental crutches of any sort. The "ideal" Satanist is a master and manipulator, and he takes a dim view of all devices that impair or weaken the excellence of the human mind. No drugs of any type are permitted at church functions. If you, as a "private" Satanist wish to use drugs, that is your prerogative, but you should also realize that such practice is antithetical to true Satanism". - Anton LaVey    Also, if you're trying to achieve spirituality then you definitely need to look for some other religion, Satanism is not for you.   The point of Satanism is independence, having control of the material world, and *rational self-interest*, not "do whatever you want". Stop trying to justify your drug use through Satanism. If you want to partake in those substances, go ahead no one is stopping you, but don't use Satanism as the crutch to lay your guilt on.   That much, I can agree with.   Yes, and there are groups fighting it in various ways:  http://www.patheos.com/blogs/templeofthefuture/2014/05/secularism-is-the-best-response-to-greece-vs-galloway/  http://humanist-society.org/invocations/apply/   Again, if you push the religion angle hoping they'll cave to stupid pranks, think again:    Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, in dissent in U.S. v. Macintosh (1931), suggested a semifunctional approach when he said, The essence of religion is belief in a relation to God involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation.    http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/madison/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/vol5ch6.pdf     I am involved in the political process, at least in terms of support of a particular cause. I've given hundreds of dollars to secular organizations that fight for the separation of church and state. I don't expect people to lay down, I expect them to play it smart, don't take the bait and play up the religion card. These legislators aren't stupid, once a legal precedent is set to allow prayers, all you are asking for next is legislation that defines what religions are and are not allowed to participate.         http://www.churchofsatan.com/eleven-rules-of-earth.php.   **1. Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked.**    Yes, going out of the way and sticking your nose in other peoples business to be the Good Guy contradicts Satanism.   You are jumping to some dubious conclusions by branding this as a case of sexual degradation. Are women helpless children that need to be protected and looked after? Maybe they like or don't care that they're dating a sleazey guy. Let them make their own decisions and mistakes. If  you have a personal issue and it's your home then kick the guy out or confront him. But that should be because you don't want to deal with bullshit drama.    Edit: You come to this sub immediately claiming ignorance ([which could have been resolved with a simple Google search](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=satanism)), you take a pot shot at LaVey, and then another potshot at the philosophy. Not a good look.   And you're correct, they will see that accommodating "diversity" is costly, and under the guise of fiscal prudence they will determine what is "reasonable".   And here's the rub: **"reasonable efforts to identify"**    The religious conservatives have this planned, the next step is to determine what is "reasonable", and now you have state sanctioned religions.   [Secular Invocations](http://humanist-society.org/invocations/)    [Apply to give secular invocations] (http://humanist-society.org/invocations/apply/)     [CFI on the issue](http://www.centerforinquiry.net/newsroom/scotus_greece_decision/)    The point is, whatever one chooses to do it should be done in the name of secularism, not Satanism or any religion. To attack this issue as a Satanist (demanding Satanic prayers, etc.) only reaffirms the position of allowing **any** religious observation, and which then brings in the question of what defines religion.    I knew there was a deeper reason why I liked this game so much.   "The Supreme Court has again affirmed that Americans are free to pray," said Defending Freedom Senior Counsel David Cortman. In America, we tolerate a diversity of opinions and beliefs; we don't silence people or try to separate what they say from what they believe. Opening public meetings with prayer is a cherished freedom that the authors of the Constitution themselves practiced. Speech censors should have no power to silence volunteers who pray for their communities just as the Founders did."    And this is my problem with "satanic" monuments and prayers in school. Advocates are playing the game and took the bait. Courts are weakening their secular stances, and all it takes is a religious fundamental push and we'll have a system that then defines what is or isn't a religion, and you can bet there will be a list of state-sanctioned religions. You can see this playing out now with judges arguing that religions need to have spiritual significance in order to be considered a religion by the state.   Crowley didn't have a mustache... but maybe that's your poorly written point? Also, "Do what thou wilt" is not a Satanic motto, that's Thelema. But to the point... were you asked for your opinion or help? Why do you care? Do you feel the need to get a Good Guy Badge and be the white knight?    Here's Peter Gilmore on what Satanic Magic can mean to the those not ritually inclined:    "So to be a master of magic, toss out those musty grimoires, unless theyre printed  by Chilton. Pick some field and become an advanced practitioner. Be a writer, pastry chef, seamstress, flower arranger, plumber, sculptor, carpenter, photographer, upholsterer, electrician, pilot, beautician, steelworker, medic, whatever you have an affinity for. Youll amaze those around you, gain their respect and envy, achieve material success and you wont even have to say Shemhamforash in public. The better you are, the more Satanic youll be, a member of the true elite of the able. The sheep will be so dazzled that they wont even notice the Baphomet around your neckif you choose to wear it. But when they do, theyll certainly think theres something to it because of your position of achievement in the mundane world. We not only rejoice in the fleshy life, we are masters of it. That is Satanic magic."   You should absolutely be skeptical and inquisitive, but no need to throw the baby out with the bathwater.    "Satanic women don't want to gain their strength by castrating men, or by making themselves out as victims. Whether they're providing healing and inspiration to those under their roofs, cracking the whip in corporate circles, managing their own home-based businesses or maneuvering whatever they need to survive, all are applying and increasing their power - not whining about why they don't have any! We don't need "feminism" on our sleeve as our primary identity. We have our identity as Satanists. Satanic women are fierce; fierce defenders of their men, of their children, of their ideas and values. Wiccans understand the female archetype in a completely different way than Satanists do. We know that Woman is Nature - Darwinian law as well as peaceful, awe-inspiring sunsets. Women can be conniving and ruthless, plotting and vengeful. "Mother Nature" isn't loving and all-embracing. She's selective, cruel and unyielding." - Blanche Barton    Satanism is pragmatic, and realistic. To ignore the power of seduction, or to think that you can transcend the need for it, is naive. Do you "need" to use seduction in all facets of life? No, but to say you have no need for it ever just handicaps you. For a female perspective here are various Satanic Witches on the issues of feminism, seduction, and their roles as women and Satanists:     Blanche Barton article on Satanic Feminism: http://www.churchofsatan.com/satanic-feminism.php     Blanche Barton 9sense interview: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXEi6MeMzVU    Peggy Nadramia 9sense interview: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7Usb_cyH0k  Erin Cassavaugh 9sense interview: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeIC0qlmNhI     Jessie 9sense interview: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdpA_NJfcEI        Barbara Ehrenreich is a prominent atheist who's open to the idea of some kind of mysticism. FYI I do not agree with some of conclusions (that there may be some kind of unified mind/consciousness) but she does push the idea that one can be godless but try to reconcile some kind of materialistic mysticism.     Here's her interview on the Point of Inquiry podcast: http://www.pointofinquiry.org/living_with_a_wild_god_barbara_ehrenreich_atheism_and_transcendence/      Atheist: person who disbelieves or lacks belief in the existence of God or gods.    That's all. Many Buddhist are atheists, but they also believe in the supernatural. Within the Satanic framework, there MAY be some aspects of the human mind and within nature that some may consider to be "magical", but his *does not* necessitate in the belief in gods, demons, spirits, or anything supernatural. Satanism is a materialistic religion, so such experiences or observations should be recognized as being "carnal", of this world, and what some Satanists call "supernormal".   And that's fine. There are plenty of Satanists who have little to no interest in magic and are comfortable and confident enough to disagree and life their own lives accordingly.   Here's a helpful interview on Adam Campbell's 9sense podcast with Magister Nemo on Greater Magic and Satanism: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCcYWmeSkCI   "What does Satanism mean to you?" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzlOtvDFjx0   I'd like to post this to my Twitter feed, how may I credit you? Do you have a blog/page/etc.? https://twitter.com/InvisibleWar      I haven't read the original TDA it myself so I can't say for certain, but it's my understanding that this reprint (The Black Pope) revoked a lot of the material from the original. I did read through the Black Pope and it felt like Wolfe had a thick ax to grind with LaVey, even though he does note his historical importance. Wolfe's "new findings" are questionable at best, and often got basic facts wrong. TSLoaS is Blanche Barton's biography of LaVey, so there's a certain adoration in the style, but she did her homework and it shows.

If you want something to hold you over I *highly* recommend getting [Letters From the Devil: The Lost Writing of Anton Szandor LaVey](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0557431735/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8 camp=1789 creative=390957 creativeASIN=0557431735 linkCode=as2 tag=underwoamusem-20). So many questions and issues brought up on this reddit sub are similar to the letters written to LaVey in the early days of the Church of Satan. I've often referred to this book in response to questions here. You get a clear picture of his sense of humor, practicality, and sense of understanding of the human animal.   Blanche Barton has a new, expanded edition in the works. Last I heard she's in the publishing stage. It's certainly a book worth reading but would hold off unless you're looking to collect an early edition.   Agreed. It's a common potshot against Satanists to say we're all going for the film noir, LaVey look, or trying to be a shock rocker. I think some young Satanists pick up on that look at first, attracted to the image. They usually soon out grow that, or drop Satanism all together when they discover that no else is impressed by playing look-a-like and the shock turns to schlock.    Aesthetics should also be take context into consideration. If we're doing a ritual or ceremony using symbols from a 1940's movie, then yes you'll see Satanists dressed the part, otherwise they'd ruin the Total Environment.    What I'm getting at with all these photo links of other Satanists is that the "Satanic look" is a personal application of each individual. A Satanist recognizes archetypes and does not shy away from using them to his or her advantage, knowing the power of aesthetics. Some of the most successful Satanists that I know very rarely wear their Sigils of Baphomet out in everyday life, but if you take a peek at their work, presentation, and life philosophies you should be able to pick up a few hints of the diabolical.

An activist, entrepreneur, journalist, and enthusiast, he has worn enough hats to open a haberdashery. Bonner has been a Senior Designer at Playboy, and the Creative Director of Victory Records; he is the founder of Coffee Common, a customer education brand, and Crash Space, a hackerspace in Los Angeles.     Bonner has organized conferences and unconferences including the first BarCamp in Los Angeles and The New Context Conference in Tokyo. But wait! Theres more! Bonner recently launched the clothing line Burn In Hell A and is part of the multimedia art and music collective Cross My Heart Hope to Die. He has been a regular contributor to BoingBoing and has written editorials for MAKE and Al Jazeera, among others.   His current project, Safecast, is a global sensor network that has been measuring radiation levels in Japan. Safecast will be looking for volunteers in Los Angeles, expanding their citizen-driven data collection to log air-quality information. Volunteers will be taking measurements by placing air quality-logging devices outside people's homes, expanding to other cities as kinks are worked out."   The "Satanic" aspects of our wedding were in the metaphors and symbols we used. People "in the know" picked up on it, but everyone else didn't have a clue and thought it was just an atheist wedding. We married on April 30th, Walpurgisnacht, on a cliff-side at sundown. The day celebrates the arrival of spring, so as the sun set on one chapter of our lives, a new one awaits. We started the ceremony with a reading from Goethe's Faust that calls out people's fear of superstitions and the unknown:   Who fears today   His rites to pay,   Deserves his chains to wear.   The forest's free!   This wood take we,   And straight a pile prepare!   Yet in the wood   To stay 'tis good   By day, till all is still,   With watchers all around us plac'd   Protecting you from ill.   With courage fresh, then let us haste   Our duties to fulfil.   The poem describes a party who are taking refuge in the woods on this night. They send out guards dressed like ghosts to scare away their attackers, using their own foolish superstitions against them.  	126

They're practically synonyms by now.   dunno   x-post this to /r/AnimalsWithoutNecks       I think it is because movies/shows are linear, noninteractive, and long in comparison with other forms of media.

Hi, I just want to say that people often confuse me for you, and that the similarity of our nicknames is purely incidental. :-)   No, I am not him. I was asked a couple of times before though. I have identified with this nickname since primary school. Copypaste of my username's origin :  It has nothing to do with fun. It has to do with panting. "Funt" means to pant in Czech and when I was little and used to go to school with my sister I would pant because she was bigger and older than me and I had problems to catch up with her. Idk exactly when it happened, but she called me "funk" a couple of times, I think, and I made a nickname out of it later. It is not easily translatable, but I think "the little one who pants" could be fitting.  Btw it's uncanny, though, we both live in Europe and I am just a few months older than he is.    One cool thing about FAR is that it gives you tons of information about how your aircraft will perform right in the SPH  Assuming you know how to interpret the data. :D   I was pretty content with 1.0 aero, but I am going to try the hell out of this.

"You'll walk... With a limp!"   Reddit is like Monty Python, but completely different.    Also the button does not feel pain. It is a button  Ok you got a point with this one.   I'll pass, real laser tag is better.   Didn't you know? The /r/gaming is all about nostalgia.   You are admitting to being a part of the problem - you want the button to last as long as possible, and we all want to know what happens when it runs out. You are despicable.  What if the button is in pain and it screams PRESS because it eases its pain?   I wouldn't change my flair for anything.   The button clearly says "BUTTON PRESS BUTTON PRESS IT BUTTON THE BUTTON PRESS IT PRESS THE BUTTON BUTTON BUTTON PRESS IT THE BUTTON THE BUTTON PRESS BUTTON IT PRESS IT THE BUTTON PRESS IT NOW", so you are clearly commiting a heresy against the button by waiting. Pressing the button should be your duty since the button commands you so.   All purples are equal.   Kerbal Space Program: The Prequel   A few days ago I landed on Minmus but realized I hadn't restored one of my science instruments, so I went down from the orbital station with a jetpack -if it weren't for ragdolling, I wouldn't have enough monoprop left to do that.   I strongly disagree, ragdolling is very fun in KSP. I would keep the ragdolling but as other people have pointed out in this thread, the issue is the recovery. When you want to ragdoll you just let it be and when you don't you should be able to instantly recover.   Why do you think it doesn't fit?   There was a thread when OP asked what would people do with their clone. A lot of people answered they'd fuck themselves. So, if you'd fuck your clone, your copy must also be pretty much into it.   Why?   If dV requirements stayed the same, then from Eve to low Moho orbit is is takes 1600 m/s of dV according to this tool  http://ksp.olex.biz/  Something something Oberth effect, like in a sense that a burn is more efficient when done closer to the source of gravity or whatever (except in case of plane change), so it is not very much higher with planets closer to the Sun.   Purple Master Race   But you liked it, right?   My own pronunciation is a wreck.   Oooh, I might've seen some of it when I was little-r, but I don't remember it very well. Might see again I suppose.   I probably haven't seen those movies because I don't get it.   Funny thing with DistantObject, though. I was playing with that in 0.90 and the DO planet dots were not showing up where they should be in map view, but danced around. Idk, I have not installed DO in 1.0 yet.   HL3? Maybe, idk. A new mascot guy? I don't see why not, but there is only one change so far, so there is no sign that is should be a pattern.

But the idea of an interplanetary orbital station which flies from place to place stripping places of their fuel and science is strangely attractive. Maybe even smaller inter-asteroid station would pay off with science gains (considering the negligible dV requirements for moving between them).   Moho and Tylo are like muggers who stop you in an underground crossing at night and take all your dV.  Eve and Laythe are like pedophiles who lure Kerblings into their cellars with science and lock them up.  "Hey kiddo want some science?"   I am also planning to design something like that.   I am addicted to alt+F5   I once drove a wheeled module 50 km on Duna to my base. Never again.   More like a "computer" simulation - I imagine Saint's Row-esque small cyberspace box to test your stuff in without consequences.   From my experience, NERVA tended to overheat when on a large craft, but it is still quite efficient. I think it would be amazing on very large crafts constructed in orbit, which I have never done. Eh, I think I should try it and fly it in orbit over Duna.    Looks more like a four dimensional engineer to me, though.  The next update is leaking.   It is the only way to be sure.   Ain't a launch if it ain't blowin'.   Is there a mod to unblacklist all names?   No, it's just funny how on reddit there are always found people of the same profession field (jest pretenders aside).

I tested it and it works, the fairings proved to be necessary since the heat/hot air killed the kerbal even behind the heat shield. The spin stabilization works, no need for a reaction wheel.

 He has no control over what the FCC chooses directly.  Sure he does.  The president is Tom Wheeler's boss.  You piss off your boss at your own peril.  That said it wouldn't surprise me if Wheeler will get a revolving door and if he helps out the cable companies on this he'll be given a nice corner office with a six or seven figure salary and he may not give a shit what the president wants.  Still, the president is not powerless when it comes to this.       My GF told me flowers are "meh" on anniversarys and Valentine's Day and so on when they are expected.   She said for real brownie points get her flowers randomly when not expected. It tells her you're thinking of her and she's special in a way getting them for an anniversary never does.    That's a special kind of crazy right there.   *"The only difference between the Republican and Democratic parties is the velocities with which their knees hit the floor when corporations knock on their door.

Unpredictability creeps in only at very, very small scales where the Uncertainty Principle holds sway.  At that point the best that can be done is a probabilistic analysis of how likely a given particle will be in a given place with a given momentum.       Fair enough.  [Politifact weighed in a bit](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/05/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-us-health-care-system-best-world/) on what you are talking about and agrees, to an extent, that the study has its shortcomings.  They also note that the US healthcare system's flaws are real and glaring and the best they could do (futzing with the criteria) was get the US ranked 15.  Certainly better than 37th but still a long way off first place.  And besides, we see in other studies that the US ranks dead last.  The United States health care system is the most expensive in the world, but this report and prior editions consistently show the U.S. underperforms relative to other countries on most dimensions of performance. Among the 11 nations studied in this reportAustralia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United Statesthe U.S. ranks last, as it did in the 2010, 2007, 2006, and 2004 editions of Mirror, Mirror. [SOURCE](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2014/jun/mirror-mirror)    However, whenever government gets involved, you also have the added cost of the bureaucracy (i.e. the people the government hires/appoints to be in charge of the universal healthcare plan or whatever, and the overhead for whatever their department needs to function). This would likely be part of the cost in tax-dollars, so might end up balancing out on the whole, or even making it more expensive if the department is not particularly efficient.  Our current for-profit system is decidedly anything BUT efficient.  Overhead costs in healthcare represent a HUGE portion of total healthcare costs:  More than 20 years ago, two Harvard professors published an article in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine showing that health-care administration cost somewhere between 19 percent and 24 percent of total spending on health care and that this administrative burden helped explain why health care costs so much in the U.S. compared, for instance, with Canada or the United Kingdom. An update of that analysis more than a decade later, after the diffusion of managed care and the widespread adoption of computerization, found that administration constituted some 30 percent of U.S. health-care costs and that the share of the health-care labor force comprising administrative (as opposed to care delivery) workers had grown 50 percent to constitute more than one of every four health-sector employees.  SOURCE: [The Reason Health Care Is So Expensive: Insurance Companies](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-10/the-reason-health-care-is-so-expensive-insurance-companies)  Also, while there is a cost to bureaucracy remember that in a for profit healthcare system you have companies adding to the cost of healthcare to make a profit.  Getting rid of the profit (as you would in universal healthcare) goes a long way towards mitigating any bureaucratic costs.    One tactic in any argument is to characterize the other side in an unfavorable light.  So pro-choice people like to say their opponents are anti-choice because that sounds worse than pro-life.  The pro-life side likes to say their opponents are pro-abortion for the same reason.  Both sides want to frame the other side as unreasonable or evil or stupid or whatever...just portray them as unfavorably as possible.    Almost certainly less.  In every country with a universal health care system [medical costs are substantially less than in the US.](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/health-costs-how-the-us-compares-with-other-countries/)    Their [health care outcomes are better](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp0910064) than in the US too.      Of particular interest in that article is [this graph](http://wp.newrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NBC-Older-Voters-624x351.jpg) of voter ages.  Old people vote, young people stay home.  The results of that apathy are apparent today.          ^ This.  There are numerous sites on the internet debunking republican craziness.  Jon Stewart nearly nightly lampoons republican stupidity.  So does Stephen Colbert.  Others like John Oliver do similar things.  I think it is telling that the biggest liberal icons are funny (e.g. Jon Stewart) while the biggest conservative icons sell fear (e.g. Rush Limbaugh).  At the end of the day the Republicans sell Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (aka FUD).  Ebola?  Immigrants coming here to take your jobs?  Welfare queens sponging off the system and playing Nintendo while you work?  Death panels?  Big government?  Negroes in hoodies?  Gay marriage?  Take your pick and then some.  Republicans never tell you a solution.  They tell you who is at fault.  Never mind if their boogie men are phantoms.  Scared people want to believe all their problems are because of someone else holding them down....which is kinda funny if you think about it since republicans are the, "pull yourself up by your bootstraps and stop bitching about your lot in life" party.  YOU are not at fault for your lot in life!  It is the Negroes or Hispanics or Asians or Gays or Tree Huggers causing all your problems!  Republicans do not want a small government.  They just want their kind of big government.  The one that is in your living room and bedroom instead of the boardroom.  They do not want competition.  They want protection.  They do not want equality.  They want ownership.  When someone says, "I don't get how someone can vote for republicans," it is not that they misunderstand republicans or their platform.  It is in misunderstanding how people can vote so clearly against their best interests.  Republicans have some people convinced the end of the world will come from allowing homosexual couples to marry. It is beyond them to see the ways they are really being screwed.  Liberals are NOT unaware of this.  It is simply how to overcome fear which is difficult.  It takes education and work to understand the nuances of a complex society and for all too many that is just too much work.    FAR easier to blame someone else.    I live in Chicago and I very, very rarely see women harassed in this fashion (barring crazy homeless people; they harass nearly everyone).  And I do mean rarely.  Anecdotal sure and I am not always in the presence of young, attractive women but in a lifetime here you'd think I'd have seen it if it occurs as much as is portrayed in these videos (note: at some parades like Gay Pride all bets are off).  Maybe we roll in different hoods (me: Loop, Mag Mile, Streeterville, Gold Coast, Lakeview, Uptown, Edgewater and Andersonville mostly).    Paying taxes is not the same as paying into Social Security.  For instance you pay for fire insurance but hope to never have to use it and expect nothing back from it down the road.  However, if you pay into your 401K retirement plan you very much expect to collect on it in the future.  "To be fair", old people receive more out of Social Security than they put in, for most people.  This certainly used to be true and early on in a VERY big way.  It is only semi-true now and depends on a variety of factors and assumptions in how you calculate it.  [Regardless though that gap has been narrowing dramatically so if your parents start collecting after 2020](http://i.imgur.com/hR0NG3c.png) they likely will not receive back what they paid in (on average).  Note that does NOT include Medicare which, when added, absolutely makes the elderly receive more than they paid in over their lifetimes (people are living longer and medical costs rise faster than inflation and incomes).  Even then the gap is narrowing and has been over the years.   To be fair they paid into the Social Security system their whole lives.  I am betting when you get to be 60 and have paid into Social Security for 40+ years you will also be expecting some payback on that (unless you are very wealthy and those checks would amount to a pittance for you).    We can thank the French. Arkansas was named for the French plural of a Native American tribe, while Kansas is the English spelling of a similar one. Since the letter "s" at the end of French words is usually silent, we pronounce Bill Clinton's home state "Arkansaw."  Technically, Kansas and Arkansas stem from the same basic root, kk:ze: the native root for the Kansa tribe, often thought to mean "people of the south wind."  Kansas is named for the Kansas River, which is named for the Kansa tribe. It's the English spelling though, so naturally, we pronounce the final "s."  The French, however, left their mark on Arkansas' pronunciation. French explorers learned of a sect of the Quapaw, a Native American tribe in the territory now known as Arkansas, from the Algonquians, who called the people akansa (most likely related to the Kansa tribe).

It is easy to assume voter suppression because conservatives have been engaging in massive voter suppression.  This looks a lot like that.  Is this group trying to create a scandal where there is none?  Maybe but then it'd be odd for them to bring a court case to try and settle the case one way or the other.  If your side is full of shit seems to me the last thing you want is a court to assess the facts.    Ever see something on Reddit and think you are the clever one for spotting a subtle and mildly humorous mistake and hit reply to regale everyone with your sharp eyes and acumen only to find pretty much everyone else saw it too?

The issue is (as I understand it) that there was an issue with the voter registrations that made it seem 40K voters were not registered.  The state then said, nope, no problem, we got 'em all.  The plaintiffs said prove it.  We are not going to take your word for it.  From this article it seems the courts will not look in to it and just take the state's word for it.  For my money I am not saying the state did anything wrong but I think they should have to prove it in this case (which is eminently doable).

But all things haven't been equal. The studies were mostly self-selected rich white lesbians. When a study comes around that was more equal, like the Regnerus study, what happens? Do you recall what happened there?  Yeah.  [Mark Regnerus Admits His Family Structures Study Wasnt About Gay Parenting](http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2012/10/30/1110591/regnerus-admits-gay-parenting/)  And, [Journals Internal Audit Finds Flawed Gay Parenting Study To Be Bullshit](http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2012/07/27/596251/gay-parenting-bullshit/)  They do the Liberal Science where they have an answer that matches their politics then divine a study to support it.  Pot meet kettle.  _  Define the scientific standard you will accept as evidence and will believe regardless of which way it goes.  So if you define different things differently then it's okay to discriminate?  Or are you saying domestic partnerships are unconstitutional because they have the potential to discriminate?  I said neither.  I said when you make a distinction between two things (marriage and domestic partnership in this case) then you have a place where the law can discriminate.  Are you saying that your only hangup is the name?  You'd be cool with a domestic partnership that was legally indistinguishable from marriage so long as no one calls it "marriage"?  But gay people have been getting normal married all the time. They were never denied access to the institution. What they were denied was the recognition that their unions were equivalent to normal ones.  That's because they are clearly different.  Because gay people have been discriminated against for centuries.  The differences are not important. If it is an important difference please tell us how they are different and why that difference matters sufficiently to discriminate against them.  How many of these decisions have rested on Kennedy's statements in Windsor?   Not many. Windsor was decided in 2013.  Not all cases were decided after Windsor.  Windsor does lend cases since then some cover and indeed lower courts are *supposed* to defer to higher courts' precedents.  Nevertheless these courts may reference Windsor but their reasoning is not solely embedded in Windsor and make their own case why SSM bans are unconstitutional.  Kennedy is wrong because it isn't the case that the only reason not to pretend that a gay union is equivalent to a normal one is out of hatred for homosexuals.  I've already demonstrated that there are legitimate arguments that have nothing to do with animus to support natural marriages only.   This guy does a better job explaining it than I can.  There is a lot of good legal analysis there:  Many commenters seem to be assuming that, in order for a law to qualify as sex discrimination, it has to be motivated by hostility to men or women. Not so. As the Supreme Court puts it, a law can qualify as unconstitutional sex discrimination so long as it is astatutory classification that distinguish between males and females. Similarly, a racial classification counts as racial discrimination for constitutional purposes even if the motives behind it are benign.  It is also not true that a ban on same-sex marriage avoids qualifying as sex discrimination because it affects members of both genders. It still denies rights to both men and women solely on account of their sex. The fact that Bob cannot marry Colin solely on account of gender is not somehow balanced by the fact that Anne is similarly forbidden to marry Carol. Similarly, a law banning interracial marriage still qualifies as race discrimination even though both blacks and whites are barred from marrying members of the other racial group.

He's saying we don't need academically rigorous studies, because faulty studies don't show any evidence!  Hardly scientific. This is a group who's already demonstrated a history of choosing politics and feelings over science on this topic.  No, he's not saying that.    He is saying that in study after study they see NO indication that same sex couples are worse as parents than heterosexual couples. No matter how you slice it the results are the same that same sex parents are no worse for children than same sex parents everything else being equal (e.g. economic situation and so on).  That is not saying don't do science.  It is saying they have done science and so far there is no evidence that same sex couples are worse parents than hetero couples.  There is a laundry list of organizations that support this notion and I gave you a citation for it.  You are simply one of those people who reject all evidence except that which fits your preconceived notions.    Family structures aren't defined by some state approval of romance. If these were to have existed, they would have existed.  Yeah.  I already said as much.  And?  Why do you think states have historically promoted normal marriage then?  It gives structure and means for property rights, inheritance, equitable distribution of assets in case of divorce (as well as a framework for dealing with such an event) and so on.  Without such things in place society would be a mess.  There is no reason why same sex couples should not benefit from that as well.  As you said the state does not care about who you love nor should it.  If two people want to share their life together and merge their resources then a legal structure surrounding that is helpful.  Uh, then why in states where gays had these via domestic partnerships were they still challenged?  If you define things differently then you can discriminate between them in law and have laid the ground work for doing so.  If the state decides to call ALL marriages "domestic partnerships" then fine but they were not doing that.  Why deny poly's who want a poly marriage?  The legal structures around marriage are wholly inadequate for a polygamous marriage.  If one person wants to leave the marriage and there are five spouses does he/she get 20% of the estate (what if doing so means selling the house and putting the rest of the family out?)?    If one is a mother does she get her kid(s) or will the courts say it is not fair to take the child from his/her brothers and sisters?    In the case of a spouse unable to make his/her own medical decisions who gets to decide for them?  What if there is a disagreement?  In short it'd be a complete mess from a legal standpoint and the state does care about that stuff.  It's already been demonstrated that the state has no interest in approving gay romance. It's not denying them anything, it's simply not recognizing their relations as something they are not and pretending they are the same.  The same argument was given when interracial marriage was the question.  No one was denying people the right to marry.  They just could not marry outside of their own race.  That's fair right?  Right. It's because one man poisoned the well, and it's become a big circular reasoning firing squad.  Wow, so all those courts are just wrong and unable to see what is so clear to you and others.  They didn't look at evidence or jurisprudence or anything like that.  They are all blinded by one guy who managed to hoodwink the whole judiciary.  Tell you what, read some of the decisions then come back and tell the rest of us where the judge went wrong.  I did it for your one judge who gave an opinion you liked.  I gave you arguments already. My condolences.  And I debunked all of your arguments.  Sorry but you've got nothing so far.  You'd [probably like this guy.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8JsRx2lois)     I'm really sorry but those studies aren't academically rigorous. These studies are nearly universally self-selected rich white lesbians. This is called sampling bias and cannot be generalized. Further rich white kids tend to have better outcomes regardless of family structure.  Yes, this is the usual reply given.  Fact is this has and is being studied a great deal, especially lately.   Judith Stacey, of New York University, stated: "Rarely is there as much consensus in any area of social science as in the case of gay parenting, which is why the American Academy of Pediatrics and all of the major professional organizations with expertise in child welfare have issued reports and resolutions in support of gay and lesbian parental rights".[27] These organizations include the American Academy of Pediatrics,[6] the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,[1] the American Psychiatric Association,[28] the American Psychological Association,[29] the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy,[30] the American Psychoanalytic Association,[31] the National Association of Social Workers,[32] the Child Welfare League of America,[33] the North American Council on Adoptable Children,[34] and Canadian Psychological Association.[35] In 2006, Gregory M. Herek stated in American Psychologist: "If gay, lesbian, or bisexual parents were inherently less capable than otherwise comparable heterosexual parents, their children would evidence problems regardless of the type of sample. This pattern clearly has not been observed. Given the consistent failures in this research literature to disprove the null hypothesis, the burden of empirical proof is on those who argue that the children of sexual minority parents fare worse than the children of heterosexual parents."[7] [SOURCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_parenting)  .  Further, it doesn't even pass the laugh test to claim that gay parents of adopted kids are better parents then normal ones. If that were even remotely true our history would be littered with examples of societies organizing around the homosexual union.   You are intentionally conflating what the studies are actually studying:  In a 2006 statement the Canadian Psychological Association released an updated statement on their 2003 and 2005 conclusions, saying, "The CPA recognizes and appreciates that persons and institutions are entitled to their opinions and positions on this issue. However, CPA is concerned that some persons and institutions are mis-interpreting the findings of psychological research to support their positions, when their positions are more accurately based on other systems of belief or values."[3] Several professional organizations have noted that studies which opponents of LGBT parenting claim as evidence that same-sex couples are unfit parents do not in fact address same-sex parenting, however, and therefore do not permit any conclusions to be drawn about the effects of the sexes or sexual orientations of parents. Rather, these studies, which only sampled heterosexual parents, found that it was better for children to be raised by two parents instead of one, and/or that the divorce or death of a parent had a negative effect on children.[3][49] In Perry v. Brown, in which Judge Vaughn Walker found that the available studies on stepchildren, which opponents of same-sex marriage cited to support their position that it is best for a child to be raised by its biological mother and father, do not isolate "the genetic relationship between a parent and a child as a variable to be tested" and only compare "children raised by married, biological parents with children raised by single parents, unmarried mothers, step families and cohabiting parents," and thus "compare various family structures and do not emphasize biology."[50] Perry also cited studies showing that "adopted children or children conceived using sperm or egg donors are just as likely to be well-adjusted as children raised by their biological parents."[50]  Gregory M. Herek noted that "empirical research can't reconcile disputes about core values, but it is very good at addressing questions of fact. Policy debates will be impoverished if this important source of knowledge is simply dismissed as a 'he said, she said' squabble."[51] [SOURCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_parenting)  .  What?  If you lack the legal protections that come with marriage then having children with another person is far more fraught with danger (e.g. what happens in a split, what happens if one parent dies, etc.)  If same sex couples can marry then having an extended family becomes a much more reasonable possibility.  So, if the state's interest is in fostering extended families then it is without a doubt in the state's interest to allow same sex marriages as opposed to banning them.  What is the State's interest in approving of who adult homosexuals love?  None.  Neither is it in the state's interest to approve of who heterosexuals love.  Not sure what your point is.  Incorrect. If the State is in the business of approving romantic expression, how can it discriminate against those who do not conform to the romantic binary? If the state approves of the romance between two homosexuals, then it must also approve the romance of other groupings.  Because it is not about the state approving of romantic expression.  Never has been.  The state's interest extends to legal issues such as inheritance and medical power of attorney and tax benefits and social security benefits and so on.  Those benefits are being denied to a particular group and for no rational reason.  There IS a rational reason for denying it to someone who wants to marry their dog or someone who wants to marry more than one person.  Legal convenience is a human right now?  If the state grants you a right it needs to have a good reason for denying that same right to another citizen.  There is no good reason to deny these rights to same sex couples beyond animus towards that group.  There is a reason 15+ court cases all across the country have found SSM bans unconstitutional and why the US Supreme Court knocked down DOMA.  That's because that was still marriage. This new marriage isn't, its gay marriage.  No animus at all.  The arguments against allowing interracial marriage were [practically identical to the arguments being made today against SSM.](http://www.mediaite.com/online/bet-you-cant-tell-the-difference-between-these-actual-anti-interracial-and-anti-gay-marriage-quotes/#0)     http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2014/09/governor_ag_explain_need_for_a.html[1]        Nothing bigoted in that reasoning.  Yes there is.  1. Biological parents best candidates for "office" of mother and father  There is no evidence whatsoever to support this.  If anything the opposite is true.  [Children of same-sex couples are happier and healthier than peers, research shows](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/07/children-of-same-sex-couples-are-happier-and-healthier-than-peers-research-shows/)  2. Gay married couples don't have extended families  And why don't they?  Because they lack the legal protections of marriage that hetero couples enjoy.  If same sex couples are allowed to marry many more will seek to have children.  Many already do (see article linked just above).  Apart from that there is NO requirement that hetero couples have children in order to be married.  What if your fiance had a hysterectomy for some reason?  Should she be banned from marriage?  What if an elderly couple wants to get married and can no longer have children.  Should they be banned from marriage?  Quite simply the law has never regarded "having children" as the litmus test for marriage.  Even if it does same sex couples can and do have children.  3. Prevents marriages of "two or more"  Allowing same sex marriage is NOT the same thing as allowing polygamous marriages.  It is a strawman that is often held up that if you allow same sex marriages then really any marriage is allowable...marry your dog for instance.  As it happens there are actually good reasons for not allowing polygamous marriages (or marriages to your dog).  4. Makes settling estates easier to handle   No, it does not.  If that is true for same sex couples then it also MUST be true for hetero couples.  Indeed one of the big reasons same sex couples want to be allowed to marry is that it makes the dispensation of their estate simpler.   5. Altering social norms undermines a "civil society"  You could say the same for ending interracial marriages which were thrown out in Loving v. Virgina.  The world didn't end though and few would argue for a return to those marriage restrictions.     Do you think SCOTUS in 1888 was affirming gay marriage or just the right to normal marriages?  Note is says 14 times since 1888.  I have no doubt that in 1888 they did not mean gay marriage.  In this case, the banning of ALL marriages, they will run squarely into even the 1888 decision not to mention all the rest.  No need to invoke same sex marriage on that one.  All that said there is a reason that 15+ court cases recently have all found the bans on same sex marriage unconstitutional and made same sex marriage legal in more than half of US states.  You simply cannot read the constitution and find a way to ban same sex marriage for anything other than bigoted purposes.      Would you have made the same argument in the cases of the states back in the 1960s that did not wish to allow interracial marriages?  Do not get me wrong.  I am not agreeing with the fuckwit Idaho GOPer.  I am merely saying he can threaten to take his ball and go home and have his temper tantrum but it really won't change anything.  Eventually they'll figure that out and won't block marriage in Idaho.  Even if they did manage to ban all marriage in Idaho (which I seriously doubt) it will not avail them much anyway.  The US Supreme Court has deemed marriage a fundamental right.  **Fourteen times since 1888, the United States Supreme Court has stated that marriage is a fundamental right of all individuals.**  In these cases, the Court has reaffirmed that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause, essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men, and sheltered by the Fourteenth Amendment against the States unwarranted usurpation, disregard, or disrespect.

Youth voter turnout rates also declined from 2008 to 2012, contrary to initial reports based on the national Election Day exit polls, which had shown the youth voter turnout rate holding steady. According to the Census Bureau report, the turnout rate among 18-to 24-year olds fell to 41.2% in 2012 from 48.5% in 2008. (Most of the post-election analysis of the youth vote focused on 18- to 29-year-olds and showed no change in voter turnout rates between 2008 and 2012; the Census Bureau report only provides an analysis for those ages 18 to 24 years.) The turnout rates of adults ages 65 and older roseto 71.9% in 2012 from 70.3% in 2008, according to the Census Bureau report.  SOURCE:  http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/05/08/six-take-aways-from-the-census-bureaus-voting-report/  I am willing to bet if millenials turned out and voted in the same percentages as the 65 and older crowd you'd see them taken seriously by politicians and they'd have an effect on the political landscape.  Millennial apathy is a self fulfilling prophecy.    Its difficult to imagine so full of hate, so hell-bent on denying all the obligations and privileges that accompany marriage to same-sex couples, that they would be willing to demolish the institution altogether. From a legal point of view, thats what the cessation of the issuance of marriage licenses would do in that state.   Nah.  I doubt there is anywhere in Idaho that is more than a three hour drive from a neighboring state (and most of the population is lot closer to a border than that).  So, simply cross a border, get married and then Idaho has to recognize the marriage via the Full Faith and Credit clause of the US Constitution.  Bit of a hassle sure but not all that much to get married.     Very cool. (really...super neat tech)  As noted in the video though it seemingly cannot take into account road conditions (e.g. rain, snow).  I am interested how it knows how heavy a load it is carrying which they do not mention.  That data is certainly critical.  Overall though very neat stuff.  The question remains do any other manufactures have advanced safety systems or is Volvo the only game in town for this stuff? (Again, really asking.)    No thanks, I'll take one of those fancy European trucks[1]   any day of the week.  US trucks don't have advanced safety features? (I am really asking, I do not know.)  Also, I am curious if there was any cargo in that trailer in your video.  I cannot imagine a heavily laden truck stopping in that short of a distance.  If they can that is awesome but I am dubious it is possible.    What amazes me is how, of all the countries seeking nukes, they got them.  Iran which is far larger and more prosperous is still dicking around trying to get one but NK has had one for years?    WTF?  It really is not at all easy to produce nukes yet a country that is about as backwater and behind the times as NK is manages it?  Just baffles me.    Was expecting a [Roseanne Barr version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls1YVhcLD2c) of the national anthem.    Was happily surprised it wasn't and that it was well done.  I was thinking if anyone would do it like Roseanne it'd be Jack Black but I think the [Rosanne episode](http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20118450,00.html) (although seriously...what the fuck did they expect?) made it abundantly clear to all who come after her that you don't fuck around with the US national anthem.    Technically they are the same thing.  For instance H2O (water) is the same regardless if it was made in a lab or came from a lake (not counting other impurities...which may or may not be good for you like minerals or toxic waste...that might be in lake water).  Taurine would be the same in this respect.  It has a chemical makeup and no matter how it was produced the end result is identical no matter the source or method to produce it.  That said it is usually not as healthy to take supplements as it is to let nature sort things out.  As an example diabetics have a harder time and more health related issues taking insulin manually rather than having it naturally produced.  Same for a cat getting its taurine.  You CAN give it taurine but better if it gets it naturally via its natural diet (meat) as it will be regulated much more efficiently and correctly via natural means.  EDIT to add: Also, manufactured sources may be dodgy.  It is difficult to discern how careful one source is from another.  Taurine is taurine but if manufactured it is possible other impurities are present which could be bad.  Again, natural sources are preferable.

Believe it or not that was a technological marvel and leap forward in mass storage technology when it came out.    The thing is the taurine a cat needs ~~must come from an animal source~~.   I used to help adopt dogs at my local shelter and the people helping with the cats said they would occasionally get some vegans who wanted a vegetarian cat.  They were told it is a horrible idea and will hurt/kill the cat.  Yes, there are taurine supplements you can sprinkle on their food but ~~it is animal protein processed into a powder.  While it no longer looks like meat it pretty much still is.~~  ~~So, if that cat food has taurine then it is not vegetarian.~~  ~~You simply cannot feed a cat a 100% vegetarian diet to without hurting it.~~  Taurine is a type of amino acid, and amino acids form the main constituents of all proteins. Taurine is exclusively found in animal-based proteins. It is critical for normal vision, normal digestion, normal heart muscle function, to maintain normal pregnancy and fetal development, and to maintain a healthy immune system. Taurine is an essential amino acid in the cat.  [SOURCE](http://www.vcahospitals.com/main/pet-health-information/article/animal-health/taurine-in-cats/3857)  EDIT to add:  Per some other comments below it seems I was wrong and that taurine can be produced synthetically (and it is in great quantities) .  Taurine, while referred to as an amino acid, is actually an amino sulfonic acid.  That said feeding your cat a vegetarian diet is fraught with risk to the cat and great care must be taken to be sure it gets proper nutrition.  A cat is a carnivore through and through.  Mother nature made it that way and its health is geared to derive what it needs from animal sources and not vegetable sources.  Apart from the taurine issue cats can suffer from urinary tract problems more easily if they are kept on a vegan diet due to the relative acidity of meat to vegetables.    tl;dr It is *possible* to feed a cat a vegan diet and for it to thrive but that diet must be maintained with great care and some difficulty or problems can occur.  Bottom line a cat is built as a carnivore and it'll be a lot happier as well as easier to maintain it on a meat based diet.

Clearly the dogs remember their person and miss their person deeply and remember them even after many months have passed.  Read the [story of Hachik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachik%C5%8D), a dog in Japan who would meet his human at the train every day.  One day his person didn't come home (he had died).  The dog returned to the station every day till the dog died hoping to greet his person again.  The dog has a statue there now remembering him and his loyalty.  There are other stories of dogs doing similar things when their person dies.  There is no way for this soldier's dogs to know he has died.  They will just keep waiting for him to come home and will be disappointed that he doesn't.  In time they will be less and less worried that he has not come home but they will never forget him and they will miss him...same as the rest of us humans.      I'd be willing to ship you a bottle.

Here's just some of their ad wizardry:      Malort, kick your mouth in the balls!     Malort, when you need to unfriend someone IN PERSON.     Malort, tonight's the night you fight your dad.     Malort, the Champagne of pain.     Malort, turning taste-buds into taste-foes for generations.     Drink Malort, it's easier than telling people you have nothing to live for.     Malort, what soap washes its mouth out with.     Malort, these pants aren't going to sh** themselves.    I heard something similar (although the rumor I heard was that a pilot once touched the heated glass and got a bad burn even through his gloves...those are pretty serious gloves they wear though so I am dubious).    If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it *might* be a Martian alien masquerading as a duck but then again it might just be a duck.    You can make a video like this that picks apart any game/movie/song/etc. A lot of nit picks, and making fun of silly little video game quirks.   You can do this with anything.  For example listening to this made me think how they'd describe sex:  *"First I had to remove her clothes.  Tedious but ok, figured I'd keep going to get to the better stuff.  After that where's the substance?  This first 20 minutes is some kissing, some caressing but that gets old fast.  When you get to the main part it is just in and out, in and out repeated.  How repetitive can you get?*    *She's beautiful but seriously, there's just not much there, seen it before, been there, done that, no mystery.  I tried to like it but meh..."*      So what are we supposed to do about the tyranny of the current minority?  The fix is simple.  Make the filibuster the good old stand on the floor talking till you drop kind while maintaining a quorum in the senate.  That way they can filibuster for the things they REALLY care about but otherwise won't bother.  IIRC the senate majority leader can force this anytime he/she wants but they don't because none of them wants to sit there listening to someone read the phonebook when there are fund raisers to go to.     What is a complication?  A "complication", in this case, is a term used by watchmakers to mean anything the watch does beyond displaying the time (hours and minutes).  So, for example, a day of the month display would be one complication, a split second hand would be a second complication, phases of the moon a third and so on.     It never ceases to amaze me how massively outclassed the Allied tanks were for a good portion of the war...  Outclassed is a bit misleading here.  Yes, when a Tiger was in working order with the supplies it needed it was a fearsome weapon and no Allied tank matched it (IIRC in the battle of Kursk Soviet tank drivers took to ramming the Tiger since it was about the only way they could stop one).  But that formidability does you little good when it spends more time getting repaired or idled for various reasons (it was a maintenance nightmare).    It was a great tank but it was complex and expensive.  The Soviets showed what a "good enough" tank could do in the T-34.  By German standards it was a piece of shit in fit and finish but it had it where it counted.  Sloping armor and enough of it and a good gun.  Indeed its kinda loose manufacturing tolerances made it much easier to service in the field.  And of course they built a jillion of them.  Remember the Sherman was never remotely meant to be a match for a Tiger.  It was a medium tank and the Tiger was about the heaviest of heavy tanks.  It is one case where America opted for numbers over quality.  Someone once said, "Quantity has a quality all its own."    No, it is a [175th anniversary limited edition (seven copies made) watch.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-13/patek-philippe-unveils-grandmaster-chime-the-world-s-most-complicated-wristwatch-ever-.html)  It is the most complex watch ever made (20 complications).    The other problem is that while Maddox makes some good points he implies a world where someone should be the arbiter of what is "good" and worthy of publication.  That world is a lot scarier than a world with BuzzFeed in it.    Do you really think the primary goal is to reduce speeding?  I have no doubt they tell you that but when revenue from speed camera is a budget item and the city frets it is not collecting enough traffic fines it tells us the system's primary goal is generating revenue for the city.    Nope (did not ask him to "go fast" or "hurry" or any such thing).  I realized though that he had just wiped out a good part of his profit for the night.   From the article:  Drivers in Chicago have gotten wise to speed cameras, budget figures show, and now the city needs to come up with $50 million in revenue.   I was in a cab that was nailed by that Irving Park Rd. camera.  Hate those things.      It won [outstanding Achievement in Makeup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_American_Werewolf_in_London#Makeup_effects) the first year it was given at the Academy Awards.  IIRC doing the makeup for that scene took many hours to pull off as they meticulously applied little changes at a time.   Animaniacs was amazing.  The writing and voice acting were outstanding.  My favorite is the [tongue twister episode with Pinky   the Brain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIu4fP4fOHE).  It is based off of the reputedly [hardest tongue twister in the world](http://www.dogonews.com/2013/12/7/mit-researchers-reveal-the-worlds-toughest-tongue-twister) (at least in English) according to the Guiness Book of Records.  It's astonishing they even thought to try it much less pull it off so well.   Some of the biggest wimps I have ever met are bullies who get the tables turned on them.  They seem to forget that there is always a bigger fish and it is beautiful when bullies get their comeuppance.     I don't believe youre reading what I'm writing. Also, starting a post with belligerent, pedantic insults about "magical fairies" prohibits me from discussing this in a decent manner.   I listed the clear and unmistakable references in the 12-steps to a higher power.  If you do not want to call that god then anything is game including magical sky fairies.  You just cannot hand-wave it away when it is inconvenient for you.    It is there in the steps, like it or not, and there are plenty of AA groups that are explicitly heavy on the religion.  If you live in a big city you likely will have options.  If you live in the country you likely have one choice and if mandated by a court that is what you get whether you like it or not.  If that group is a bunch of holy rollers that is what you get (had a friend in college get one of those in rural Indiana).  I'm not going to go though point by point. You clearly have a misunderstanding in regards to differentiating 12 Step fellowships (like AA) and the 12 Step treatment model used in professional facilities. They are not one and the same. My "chill AA group" is a certified drug and alcohol treatment center that is no way associated with any 12 Step fellowship. We simply use the 12 Step modality as part of our program.   You are responding in a thread about AA and we are talking about AA's 12-steps and you want me to be able to distinguish between your 12-steps and AA's 12-steps?  I am to go back and read your past posts on this topic so I know what you are talking about?  That's not how this works.  First, I would submit that if you call your steps 12-steps and AA calls theirs 12-steps then there is going to be confusion.  If your 12-steps are distinct from AA's 12-steps it is up to you to tell the rest of us because the rest us will be understandably confused.  We will not just guess that your way is somehow different.  Further, I am betting that a "certified drug and alcohol treatment center" is not free to attend like most AA meetings are.  My GF was in one, she paid for it and the first time she slipped up and drank again they kicked her out of the program (easy to show a success rate when you kick out those you worry will not be successful).  For what it is worth she's fine now but that was a hard time for her and really crushed her.  If your system is applying a rigorous scientific model to addiction treatment then great.  I know it is difficult.  It remains that the AA system as pushed all over the US is worthless or worse as a treatment.   IIRC in Japan games used to release on a Friday.  The Japanese are so into games that huge portions of the country's workforce would call in sick or take time off that it was literally having an economic negative impact on the country.  As a result they passed a law making release dates be on Tuesdays (or something...it has been a long time and I cannot find a citation for this so take with a grain of salt but pretty sure I remember this happening like this).    First off six of the twelve steps resort to a "higher power".  Not you fixing yourself but you putting your recovery in the hands of god or a magic sky fairy or invisible pink unicorns or whatever.  - Came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.  - Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.  - Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.  - Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.  - Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.  - Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.  The twelfth step is a command to spread the word (i.e. proselytize):  - Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.  Second, while your particular AA group was pretty chill about the whole god thing some AA groups most decidedly are not and it is a full court press at converting people to religion (I have personally known people who have been to this sort).  More problematic is courts will mandate AA treatment with no regard for effectiveness or that they are forcing people to go to a religious service.  Third, as noted above there is pretty much no scientific evidence for the efficacy of AA.  Sure there are LOTS of anecdotes out there but isn't it interesting you only hear about the success stories?  That is because it is self selecting.  If you finish the twelve steps the last step tells you to go out and spread the word.  If you don't finish you fall by the wayside and probably never speak up about it.  Fourth, AA was founded by Bill Wilson who found god while tripping his balls off in a hospital.  Bill Wilson, cofounder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), was admitted to Towns Hospital four times between 1933 and 1934. On his fourth and last stay he showed signs of delirium tremens[15] and was treated with the Belladonna Cure. He had his "Hot Flash"[vague] spiritual awakening while undergoing this treatment, either on his second or third night, depending on the source.[11] When he was released from Towns Hospital after a seven day stay, he never drank again.  snip  The formula[clarification needed] for Towns-Lambert cure was the deliriant, Atropa belladonna, also called deadly nightshade. The effects of belladonna include delirium, hallucinations, light sensitivity, confusion, and dry mouth. The second ingredient in the mixture was another deliriant, Hyoscyamus niger, also known as henbane, hog's bean, or insane root. It contained two alkaloids, hyoscyamine and hyoscine. The third major ingredient was the dried bark or berries of Xanthoxylum americanum, or prickly ash, added to help with diarrhea and intestinal cramps.[7] The dosage given was determined by the physiologic reaction of each patient. When the face became flushed, the throat dry, and the eyes dilated, the amount of the mixture was reduced or stopped.[8]  The mixture was given every hour, day and night, for nearly 50 hours. The end of the treatment was marked by the abundance of stools and then castor oil was given to the patient as a further purgative.[8] The treatment was also described as 'puke and purge'. [SOURCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_B._Towns#The_Belladonna_Cure)  Are you actually comfortable that the whole "science" of AA is based off the experience of a person who saw god while *literally* out of his mind tripping?    There are two notions when it comes to sentencing.   1) Punishment 2) Rehabilitation  Both are needed and should comprise a final sentence.    Unfortunately that video is showing as unavailable.   Any mirrors?  (I looked but did not find any)  EDIT to add:  Apparently it is the October 9, 2014 episode which can be seen here: http://thedailyshow.cc.com/full-episodes/40z49z/october-9--2014---jeremy-renner   Sure they did.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit thought it was peachy as did (apparently) SCOTUS justices Thomas, Alito and Scalia.  Apparently the courts are fine with this kind of bullshit.  I wonder what they'd do if some state tried the same thing with their gun laws.  Say make a law that all gun shops keep their guns locked in a vault on par with Ft. Knox...you know...for safety!     Sorry, that is the only way I have it.  Cropping the image would be easy though to get rid of that and you wouldn't lose anything important to the picture.  That or perhaps some Photoshop whiz here can erase that (if you know what you are doing with Photoshop I think that is pretty easy).       This happens on Reddit a lot. If he/she did not explicitly point out it was sarcasm then almost certainly someone would be having a hissyfit about how inappropriate it is to burn buildings over a hockey match.

(Note: Not unique to the UK)   On a crowded elevator turn to your friend and ask:  "So, how's that rash coming along?"   - The Magic Door.   - Romper Room   - The Banana Splits   Democrat and Republican are not ideologies.  They are political parties that espouse a particular set of ideologies.  Generally people will join one or the other based on what the party stands for.  That said you may be a liberal but join and support the republican party because (as an example) you feel your business interests will be best served by the republican party.     Aquaman is pretty powerful.  IIRC he fought the Justice League to a standstill.      He is ridiculously underrated.  He is ridiculously OP.      It seems ridiculous, at least to me, that a candidate can get 51% of the vote and therefore get 100% of the electoral college votes.  Err...in a direct vote if a candidate gets 51% of the vote they win so what is it you are complaining about?  The inherent problem is that the minority gets no voice. It limits the "swing states" to being the only areas really motivated to go out to the booths on voting day.  Wow, this is just so wrong.  In a direct vote candidates could utterly ignore the "fly over states".  They need a majority and that majority is squarely in the major cities and a few big states.  In a direct vote how much time would you expect candidates to pay to Alaska or North Dakota or Vermont?  The Electoral College is akin to trying to win the World Series.  The winner is not the team with the most runs scored over seven games.  It is the team that wins four of seven games.  Each game matters unto itself and no one I have ever heard thinks the World Series system would be better and more fair if it was just who scored the most runs overall regardless of winning a particular game.    Can you say "punt"?       Why am I getting downvoted (seriously)?    ...multiplayer-only titles just don't interest me all that much.   Ditto.  It is of course fine that such games are made and clearly some people really enjoy them.  Thing is multiplayer only games are very polarizing.  There will be some elite few who excel at a given game.  The rest are either mediocre and casual or just downright not adept at such games.  That puts a *huge* barrier in the way of building a large gaming community around a game.  My experience with many such games is if you aren't elite you get your ass handed to you on a regular basis and frankly that sucks after awhile (allowing for learning curve time in there).  Add to that, more often than not, other players are grade-A shit heads to you with the smack talk.  I'm a big boy and smack doesn't bother me much but then neither do I want to spend my free-time trying to have some fun having loudmouths berate me.  And the thing is there are always some group of players for any game who seem to have nothing better to do than play the game till they are fantastically good leaving the rest of the players with little chance.  Add to that as a 40-something guy I have an insanely hard time gathering friends together to play at the same time for more than 30 minutes much less a couple hours (life and all that gets in the way).  So for some few these games are great and I really think there is a place for these types of games as much as any other.  Just realize when all is said and done there is a very narrow market for them and only some few will really "make it".  All that said as an indie group seems like they really did something good here and I wish such groups have more success as a general matter so they keep trying to turn out new stuff (whatever it may be).     She's also an [award winning stand-up comedian](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en sl=no u=http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selda_Ekiz prev=/search%3Fq%3Dselda%2Bekiz%26biw%3D1920%26bih%3D1089).  Brains, beauty and humor in spades.  Helluva combo...    Hell, look at how people treat games like Call of Duty. They are solid games that are very approachable to the masses, yet "true gamers" turn their noses up at it because, frankly, it's a popular game that's not hard to get into as a non-gamer.   I may be wrong (probably am) but my sense of the dislike for Call of Duty is its inability to do anything but serve up the same game over and over.  It's not that it is a "bad" game but rather like a good meal that you keep getting served over and over again.  Eventually it gets old and boring.    ...whats worse..is that they already HAVE them on their side.   If a sitting member doesn't toe-the-line on things like this their constituents will primary them out of office.   Also a Chicagoan.  Can confirm.  $1,000/month won't get you a whole lot.  Cheaper than NY or SF but hardly a bargain either.    People probably assume something needs to be high powered to hit something (anything) that far away.  Regardless though the issue is less about how dangerous the weapon is at that distance versus the White House (with bullet proof windows and what not) than it is that someone could do this and the Secret Service not even notice for days.     Well...it depends but often a bad game is due to the publisher rushing the developers to put the game out regardless of its state and/or forcing the developers to do things the developer doesn't want (e.g. put multiplayer in regardless if it makes sense).  Devs can of course make a bad game without any "help" from a publisher but often you can tell which party is more to blame.    I put him on in the background while I do other things (clean, browse Reddit...whatever).  I click back occasionally to get a sense of the visuals.    Anything is "easy" once you know how.     Not to mention, her association with the AEI is hardly grounds to write her off as anti feminist ( hello ad hominem)...  You're right.  Being associated with AEI does not make you ipso facto wrong.  It does however mean that immediate suspicion and careful scrutiny should be given because AEI is distinctly partisan.  As I mentioned Phyllis Schlafly was working with AEI on feminism at one point which hardly inspires trust about their stance on the topic.  As for Breitbart...well...let's just say if Breitbart.com says the sun comes up in the east I will believe them but get up early tomorrow just to make sure.    Those two certainly were/are(?) influential in the women's movement.  I think "feminist" these days is too broad a brush to paint with as there are some distinct and important differences among them.  Anecdotal I know but when I bring up those two to female friends of mine (women who self describe as feminist) they *explicitly* repudiate anything like being like-minded with Dworkin or MacKinnon.    You made my point.  The people who can be arsed to go out and protest are the ones who feel all righteous and indignant about whatever it is.  When you get thousands and tens of thousands protesting nationally  such as happened during the Civil Rights movement or Occupy Wall Street then maybe there is something there.  When you get a bare handful (if that) who go and shout down some speaker here and there it is hardly a "movement".  The SJW types are fringe and they know it.  They love rattling cages and making mountains of mole hills to have even the barest sense that they are relevant.  You engaging them and freaking out is giving them the attention they crave.  In a weird way people like you enable them.      Right, because lord knows there's not 10x as many SJW-esque feminist activists running around spouting misandrist nonsense as there are these decent feminist activists that you so fondly seem to think there are?  Do you have any actual numbers on this?  I know (like most people) many women.  Most would say they are a feminist.  None would align themselves with the SJW movement.  Anecdotal I know but one I am willing to bet most people experience.  SJW is the squeaky wheel.  They are loud and noisy and as a result get attention out of all proportion to their actual numbers.  Nothing new in this tactic.   Sure but they are on the "same side" on only a narrow range of particular points and their reasoning for "agreeing" on these points is completely different.  Feminists (some anyway) see stripping as a degradation of women.  Conservatives are opposed to it out of sexual prudishness.  It is the reasoning that is at the crux of it.  Not the result.    They certainly have opposed feminism.  Unless something has changed feminism is antithetical to conservative notions of sexuality and what they see as women's traditional role in society (particularly religious conservatives).  [Phyllis Schlafly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis_Schlafly) is perhaps the embodiment of the anti-feminist stance of conservatives.  Guess who she used to work for...the American Enterprise Institute.  Same as Christina Hoff Sommers (the one in the OP's video).  EDIT to add:  Since this is getting downvoted (highlighting mine):  Some antifeminists have argued that feminism has resulted in changes to society's previous norms relating to sexuality, which they see as detrimental to traditional values or **conservative religious beliefs**.[12][13][14] For example, the ubiquity of casual sex and the decline of marriage are mentioned as negative consequences of feminism.[15][16] Many of these traditionalists oppose women's entry into the workforce, political office, and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families.[17] Antifeminists argue that a change of women's roles is a destructive force that endangers the family, or is contrary to religious morals. For example, Paul Gottfried maintains that the change of women's roles "has been a social disaster that continues to take its toll on the family" and contributed to a "descent by increasingly disconnected individuals into social chaos".[18]  [SOURCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifeminism)   I am curious how the American Enterprise Institute and Breitbart became the voices of reason on this?  I suspect it is their opposition to feminism but it has certainly made for strange bedfellows in this case.    Not to mention that for the money, number of people and reputed high skills these people have (to demand generous salaries) they seemed really crappy at turning out product.  What was ultimately obtained for all that money spent?   Yeah...kinda missing the point here.  Has radar detection ever been an issue for tanks?  Maybe it is invisible to missiles?    She is pretty careful to not get into positions where she actually has to argue her side.  She stays safely ensconced on her own website and dares not venture out to any but conventions filled with her version of [dittoheads](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Dittohead).  I signed up to her website awhile back to [respond to a post she made](http://skepchick.org/2014/05/video-should-women-get-menstrual-leave/).  It was a thoughtful response, not ranting, not aggressive and merely made a few points for discussion.  She swore at me, called me "thick" and yanked my posting privileges and distinctly avoided any actual debate.    She simply cannot tolerate scrutiny.  She makes money off of other's outrage and is happy to stoke those fires.  She has no interest in the truth.  Why they keep her on the Skeptic's Guide to the Universe is beyond me.    ... the fact is, a 15 year coma is exceptionally unlikely-even more so that one would basically be able to recover.  Unlikely yes (super unlikely) but it has happened:  - [Ayanda Nqinana](http://www.medicaldaily.com/man-wakes-seven-year-coma-after-taking-sleeping-pill-242451): 7-Year Coma - [Terry Wallis](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/man-awakes-after-19-years-in-coma/): 19-Year Coma   The occasional "why do we need to learn this, this will never be used in real life" is still here though.  When I said that to one of my teachers she looked at me and asked, "How do you know what you'll need to know in the future?"  That shut me right up and I've found she was right. You will not need or use all you've learned but you'll be surprised at what random bits become useful and there is no telling which random bits you'll need.   tl;dr Knowledge, any knowledge, is valuable even if you can't immediately discern why.       Chlorine as a chemical weapon is not very effective at killing people. The gas quickly disperses, it requires a high concentration, it gives a visible cloud, has a strong odour, and can be defeated by simple counter measures (a wet cloth preferably with urine over mouth and nose can be enough). It was the first deadly chemical gas used in WWI but even well planned uses with hundreds of tons of chlorine usually only achieved low casualty numbers and that's why Chlorine was quickly replaced by more deadly gas like Phosgene or Mustard gas.  Chlorine was plenty lethal and used a great deal in WWI.  Phosgene was more deadly than chlorine in some ways but it had a more delayed reaction.  The Germans used a mixture called "white-star" which was a mixture of phosgene and chlorine.  Mustard gas was indeed far more nasty than the other two but its downside was it persisted in the environment for a long time (relatively speaking...weeks in this case) making it dangerous for troops to occupy an area cleared with mustard gas and in the end taking territory is the point.  All told plenty of people were injured by gas in WWI (well over a million) but it was never decisive in the war and by the end troop casualties were low because they learned how to protect themselves.    Relevant: http://i.imgur.com/ahLz8Z3.jpg  (Note:  I saw this posted elsewhere around here earlier today but I cannot remember where for proper credit.)   I know a chair is not a PC but honestly it is part of the whole setup and matters.  I really wish there were better resources when it comes to buying a desk chair.  Unfortunately there aren't so, for what it is worth, I'll try and add a little data to the limited pool of info there is on this.  Desk chairs are bizarrely expensive.  I mean chair tech has been around since what...caveman times when we sat on a rock or a log?  Certainly we have been building chairs for thousands of years yet they remain stupidly expensive.  Maybe the aphorism that "you get what you pay for" is true here.  I bought a Maxnomic DX-Racer chair (chosen per their recommendation for my height) recently and have serious buyer's remorse.  They tout all the ways the chair is adjustable (and it is) but in the end if it is not comfortable who cares?  It honestly feels like a steel frame with the barest minimum of padding wrapped around it.  Ever grab a really skinny girl's upper arm?  Kinda feels like that.  The chair is only slightly more comfortable than a rock.  Lumbar support amounts to a pillow to strap to it.  The pillow is absurdly big arching your back uncomfortably.  I am pretty sure whoever designed this chair ticked a few boxes and never actually sat in it for more than a minute.    There really is almost nothing to like about this chair beyond it looking good from a distance.  My ass literally hurts while writing this.  I am about to toss this chair in the garbage and buy a new one (unless some ~~sucker~~ person here wants to buy it cheap).  If anyone has another recommendation for a desk chair I'd love to hear it!     AKA Police usually get away with this horseshit with no consequences, therefore we should accept it.        How about no? The drug war is garbage and the fact that "anyone" in the utterly corrupt system would sign off on the search warrant says nothing about it's validity.  While I do not disagree that the drug war is bullshit it is the job of the police to enforce the laws...even the shitty laws.   Geez...how fast does Reddit forget?  This was posted four days ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2gdqj3/prosecutors_seek_death_penalty_against_man_who/  Relevant post from /u/Golden-Fox from that thread that got lost in the circlejerk:  TL;DR edit: Any presence or lack of drugs will have no bearing on how this case is tried. It's no longer a case about drugs, it's a case about justifiable use of force. Whether or not the guy goes free is of secondary concern, after what effect this case may have on the ability of police to preform no-knock raids.  The fact that they didn't find actual drugs doesn't have anything to do with it. They were serving a valid search warrant. I've read the affidavit, it's well investigated, a very solid document. Anyone would sign off on it. I have taken courses both on writing affidavits and on tearing them apart. I have seen some terrible affidavits, this is not one of them.  Despite the fact that no actual drugs have been reported to have been found, there is still evidence that drugs may have been sold. Drug paraphernalia has been reported, burner cell phones, and guns. The suspect was a felon, and therefore may not legally posses a firearm. The police also seized a safe, and I feel that it is likely that records of drug sales may be found in that safe. Further, the handgun that was used to shoot the cops apparently had been reported stolen.  The man may not have had drugs on his person, but he is still far from innocent. Police were lawful in serving the search warrant, and lawful in doing it "no knock." The suspect was known to carry a handgun(illegally). If they hadn't gone after him on drug charges, they could have gotten him on weapons charges.  edit: I'm getting downvotes because I'm interfering with the anti-police circle jerk. There are tons of contemporary cases where the police have fucked up royally, and in a myriad of ways. This is not one of them. If you want a case where police have completely over reacted, look at Ferguson. If you want a case with a very poorly written arrest affidavit, look at the Zimmerman case.    To be fair this is the pain of being part of the PC Master Race.    If you by an XBox One today it will be as good as an XBox One bought a year from now.  Not so with PC stuff.  Whatever you buy today will be eclipsed with better silicon within months and the price you paid will be too much within months.  Sucks but there it is.    I'll just leave this here (we now expect a lot from your son):  [The Einstein Syndrome](http://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2001/08/31/the_einstein_syndrome/page/full)  WHAT have famed pianist Arthur Rubinstein, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, India's self-taught mathematical genius Ramanujan, Nobel Prizewinning economist Gary Becker, talk show host G. Gordon Liddy and renowned physicists Richard Feynman, Edward Teller and Albert Einstein all had in common?  Aside from being remarkable people, they were all late in beginning to speak when they were children. Edward Teller, for example, did not say anything that anyone understood until he was four years old. Einstein began talking at age three but he was still not fluent when he turned nine.    ^ Literally this.  I live in Chicago and I have seen tow trucks cruising like taxis.  The most impressive move I ever saw was a "no parking" thing went into effect at 4p on a certain street.  While watching from a hi-rise I saw ten tow trucks (yes, I counted) just idling on the street below at 3:59p.  At 4p it was like watching synchronized swimming.  All ten trucks backed up and used their quick-pik bars to snag a car and drive off.  In about 30 seconds they scooped ten cars.  For personal experience my roommate's brother parked across the street from our apartment in a lot.  He left the car, buzzed our place and we asked him where he parked.  When he told us we told him "hell no" and ran to his car.  As we ran up a tow truck was backing in to get his car.  Elapsed time...maybe 2 minutes.  Funny story:  Went to a Grateful Dead show in Chicago (Soldier Field) and my friend parked in a lot where they were being directed to park.  Paid some money to park there.  Came out, cars were towed.  Turned out someone scammed all the Dead Heads and collected money.  He got his car back without a fine. [True story.](http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4060590.html)  In short there is a lot of money in towing cars and they are absolutely on the ball about it.  At least in big cities.     21.3% on fundraising costs and administrative is pretty huge...  No it's not.  [That is pretty normal.](http://www.afpnet.org/Audiences/ReportsResearchDetail.cfm?ItemNumber=12845)  That said Komen is a shit organization which lost its way long ago.  There are plenty of organizations out there to donate to if you want to help prevent/cure breast cancer.  Avoid giving Komen money if at all possible (my opinion of course but not hard to Google [why you shouldn't](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/07/komen-foundation-charities-cure_n_793176.html)).    Help me reconcile these two statements of yours:  I'm sorry, how many times now have I said I already think trans people should disclose?  And...  ...which is why the "let the other person decide by telling them" thing is so ludicrous to me.    I am not saying you are wrong to feel the way you do...  You are making assumptions.  You'd probably be surprised if you knew me better.  I still think a transgendered person needs to let a potential partner know the deal.      Again you are making a false equivalency.  No one cares if you had your appendix out.  You are fooling yourself though if you think a sex partner won't care if you are a male, female or transgendered person.    Hell, your gender goes right to the root of sexuality!  You can wish for a world where your potential sex partners will not care about current or previous gender but you are only fooling yourself to think otherwise.    Indeed.  Those who are too smart to engage in politics are punished by being governed by those who are dumber. ~Plato    I think that is evasive.  We all have histories and we all have a sense of what is important to a potential partner.  Clearly we cannot give a recitation of our life story on Day #1.  Some things are relevant though and important.  Would you want someone with an STD to withhold that info from you?  They need not relate how they got it but they should tell you.  Personally I do not know how I would react if I found out after the fact I had sex with a transgendered person.  I want to say I'd be cool with it but honestly I do not know.  I can say I'd be upset that I wasn't told beforehand.    It is not that difficult I think.  You need to disclose to a partner information that you think might be relevant.  There is all sorts of info you can convey yet some rises above others.  - Are you married/in a long term relationship? - Do you have an STD? - Are you an axe murderer?  Stuff like that rises above whether you get paid $30k or $50k a year.  I do not think this is rocket science.  We are not trying to create a law here that covers all circumstances.  I think most of us intuit what is relevant to tell out partners.  I consider telling a potential partner you are transgendered as important.  I get why this would be difficult if you were a transgendered person but what else is there for this?     But don't try to gussy it up as something it's not with the "bare all" attitude- nobody actually does that.  I am honestly confused what you mean with this.  I'm trying to parse it and not getting it.      I agree that trans people should tell, but that's pretty weak unless you are completely serious about an entire-life-story-before-sex rule for everyone. What if my potential sexual partner is violently repulsed by the idea of fire spinners or has a circus phobia?  I think this is a false equivalency.  If you happen to be someone who has a real problem with fire spinners then I'd say it is up to you to tell a potential partner that they are not keen on dating such a person.  Such a quirk is unusual.    When it comes to a transgendered person I think it absolutely has to be up to their partner to decide how they feel about it.  I cannot imagine how it is "better" to withhold that info and think it will all work out ok in the end.  It would be nice if it didn't matter but I think we both know most people would say it does matter.  In the end, call it what it is: some people are real squicked out by the idea of having sex with a trans person, even if it objectively has no consequence to them outside of that bias.  Yup.  That said, even if that is a lousy position to take, it has to be the other person's choice to make.  But no, it is not and should not be mandatory.  To be clear I do not mean "mandatory" to be legally necessary.  I merely mean it to be "strongly advisable".  Edit to add:  I really wish the people downvoting would respond as to why they are downvoting.  It doesn't help me or the discussion if I do not know why I am wrong or offensive or...whatever.   	135

 The bull moose jolly roger waved proudly in the air as the crew ran to their stations. "Captain Teddy" as he was affectionately known to his men, began barking orders left and right for cannons to be loaded and weapons drawn. The first volley of cannonballs nearly ripped the entire side off the merchant ship (the SS San Juan).   A contract is by nature an agreed upon set of rules.  I never agreed to your society, and I never agreed to your social contract.  If you are assuming inaction = consent to your social contract, by that logic I can start a house cleaning business in which I wash all my neighbors houses, send them a bill, and then lock them in a cage when they refuse to pay. I will assume their inaction by not moving out of the neighborhood is consent to my contract.   Because some of us think the same rules that apply to individuals apply to the government.   If I offered to protect your house even though you never asked me to, and then threatened to throw you in a cage unless you paid me 10% of your earnings, would that be legal?   The government uses coercive force to extract taxes to pay for an involuntary contract which we see as inherently unjust.   Where does Zen Buddhism fall into this framework?   Everyone wears black berets with their dress uniform.   Airborne troops in an airborne unit (like the 173rd or 82nd) wear maroon berets in their dress uniform and a few other occasions.   Soldiers who are a part of the 75th Ranger Regiment wear tan berets.   One type of law or one law?  If I could nullify all laws related to governmemt involvement in the markets that would be my highest priority.   Please explain the variations and sects of Buddhist practice in layman's terms.   Read Hazlitt's *Economics in One Lesson*.  You can find it for free as a pdf download [here](http://mises.org/library/economics-one-lesson)  Ron Paul's *End the Fed* is also a wonderful introduction.      Exactly. Obedience to God's commandments is thd proper response to his love. Christianity is not about some warm and fuzzy feeling in your heart, but a way of life. The word "disciple" comes from the same word as "discipline".    2001 A Space Oddysey by Arthur C. Clarke   I carry these [little memorandum books.](http://imgur.com/a/OaRRs) I carry one for work and one outside of work. At work I post daily to do lists, important numbers, serial numbers, information etc. I use my personal one as a catch-all for my brain output. I jot down library lists, quotes I hear, snippets of ideas, subjects I want to learn more about etc. When I get home at night and begin my daily journaling routine I take the seeds of ideas from my pocket notebook and elaborate on them in paragraph form in my journal. I think this practice has made me much more introspective and mindful. It encourages me to engage the world around me for information and ideas to better myself on a daily basis.

If so what kind, what do you write in it, and how has it added value to your life?   You are going to make time for things you value. If you have time to play video games you obviously have time to read, you just have to convince yourself that reading is of greater value to you. Try intentionally contemplating the merits of being more well-read vs the instant gratification you may get from other activities.   Its ok, good parts and bad parts.    I was homeschooled. I would have gone to Murphy due to school zoning.   That saddens me. My wife and I are actually in the process of getting foster care certification, and we specifically want to care for abandoned special needs children.      Well, I live at Fort Drum.  I am from Mobile though.   I got hooked on [these](http://www.amazon.com/Memorandum-Books-Green-7530-00-222-0078-12-pack/dp/B0053D9X5M) from the Army. They are absolutely phenomenal. At $20 for a 12 pack they dont break the bank.   [Here](http://imgur.com/a/OaRRs) is my actual notebook.   No. I don't put myself in female company if I might lose control of my tongue.    Raise the child with total devotion. I don't shirk my responsibilities.   I think you should talk to a counselor instead if a bunch if internet strangers.   I only live about fifteen mins from there, no shit   CSM listened to my bio, heard thst I was from Alabama.   "SPC train_subject9974 do you know Forrest Gump?"  I then explained to him that Forrest Gump is my granddaddy, and that might explain why I am a little slow.  Sergeant Major didn't ask me any more questions.   Amazing. We need more men who shoulder responsibility instead of running from it.   This is a horrible idea. This kind of confrontational Christianity gives us a bad name.  Most Atheists come to their position after a lot of thought and study. Many of them already own copies of the Scriptures.    Not as dark as blood meridian. There is some plot resolution, but not the big jackpot of happiness.  I would recommend you read it for the prose alone. McCarthy does such a phenomenal job of painting the picture with his words.     I don't think it ever would drastically.  I for one am a happy and lifelong carnivore, and would never give up the bountiful blessing of meat.      No, it is not racist.   Too many folks want to cry racism for petty things. If folks from generations past would see the things we cry the racism card on they would turn over in theor graves.   1. Laziness is deplorable to me.  2. Stand up for those who are weaker than you.   3. Treat ladies with deference. I do not curse in front of ladies, hold the door open for them etc.  4. Being responsible for my actions. Playing the blame game is deplorable.  5. Being a man of my word. If I say I am going to do it, I am going to do it.  These are a few of the things thst define masculinity to me.   1. Thinking a man should not cry is bullshit. Men are humans. Humans cry. Emotions are natural.  2. There is a difference between having natural emotions and being a thinskinned crybaby. Life sucks. People say shitty things. Part of real manhood is learning to shrug off people's insults. I would say a man who is constantly whining, always getting his feelings hurt, etc is not a developed man. He is a baby.    I cried when my good buddy died. I do not cry when my supervisor yells at me.   Christian belief system summarized; humans are all broken sinners who are mutineers against the Law of God. The punishment for such mutiny is death. Christ (who is God) died on the cross to pay the legal debt of that mutiny. He then rose again defeating the power of death and sin. By confessing our sins and believing in his sacrifice as sufficient alone for our salvation, and surrendering ourselves to Him as Lord and Sovereign, we can have our sins forgiven.   My beliefs are summarized briefly in [The Nicene Creed](http://www.reformed.org/documents/index.html) and more in depth in [The Westminster Confession of Faith](http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/)  The differences between denominations are very nuanced and hard to explain in summary. It really depends on which denominations you are asking about. Basically there are three broad divisions  1. Roman Catholic - believe in the authority of the Pope, and the various vatican counsels as authoritative.  2. Orthodox Christian - recognizes a different patriarch than the Pope. They have their own cultural heritage and body of teaching seperate from the RC church.  3. Protestant - products of the protestant reformation. There is extreme diversity within this broad heading.   My wife and I went into our relationship agreeing that she would be a housewife and I would be the breadwinner. We established the boundaries of our roles early on, so it has never been a problem. She works a littlw business on the side, and volunteers at the USO as a shift manager.    I think the important thing is to establish your opinions on what role you each will take before your relationship gets serious and there will be no problem. I don't expect every couple to have the same dynamic my wife and I do, but if you are the kind of guy who cannot marry a career woman, don't. If you are the kind of guy who believes your wife needs to have a career, then don't marry someone who does not.   I keep a high and tight. (I am in the Army, and old habits die hard. It will probably be the only hairstyle I have for the rest of my life).  I get my hair cut every weekend. I think every man should have a great barber. I love my barber shop, its a man's retreat. I actually look forward to my weekly cut. My barber gives my high and tight, shaves the sides of my head with a straight razor, and gives me a hot towel massage. All for 11 bucks.  Day to day I use brylcreem to keep my hair parted and combed.  With regards to the ladies, I am married so I don't gove a second thought to what the ladies think. My wife loves my hair. She loves right after I get a cut and the sides of my head are smooth. She also digs the smell of brylcreem.  [I will throw in a photo.](http://imgur.com/0AaorQi)   Nah, I am like that. I don't  get crazy when I drink a lot, just chill out. I do get more social confidence, but that is about all.   Nothing but circlejerks. Bush this, Hillary that.. Oh my gosh did you hear about Romney???    And lil' old me just waiting for someone to say something about Ron Paul.   I call my wife "bookend". She likes it.    "Objective" means impartial, unbiased, not dependent upon the mind for existence, factual, etc according to the OED.   So actually that is what "objective" means.      Because I belive morality is clear cut black and white. Objective.       Sometimes what is pleasurable is not what is moral. There can be conflict.  I believe our desires are not to be trusted.   Because I believe adamantly in objective morality, I would prefer if more folks pursued moral excellence.   I keep three; a book journal (green rite in the rain notebook), a personal journal (a nice piccadilly), and a pocket notebook which is an integral part of my EDC (an Army memorandum book).   What about y'all?   No. Books are about content not aesthetic.   I mark my books up, they get battered from traveling around with me around the world (literally). I think worn books are well loved books.   What general info?   Not full seriousness.  It is a word I made up because I am a man. Its definition should be clear, and my genius irrefutable.   Ron? Is that you??   Can you believe some people don't like breakfast food?   Hell yeah. I love sushi. That shit is addictive, and it will fill you up faster than you think!   It was asked in half-seriousness. Chill out.   I love steak and eggs. It is my annual birthday breakfast. One seasoned t-bone medium rare, three hard fried eggs, potatoes o'brien, and strong black coffee.   What hearty meal is your go-to for celebration or merriment of the soul?   Nope. Just a sheepdog.   When you spend as much time as I have in violent situations, you just get wired different.    Some points to relay   1. I disagree with Thomas Paine on a good many things, he was not a classical liberal but way more progressive with his statist ideas.  2. My issue with food stamps was not how they were carried out, it lies with the fact that I find them fundamentally immoral.  3. I despise the idea of a fiat currency. I am not a keynsian. I suppory austrian economics.   Its not that I am not for unions. I fully support the right of voluntary association.  I just don't know of a single union I could support, because they support things I disagree with.   No. Because I would not ha e sex with a girl I am not already in a monogomous relationship with.   I would never seriously date a girl I am not attracted to. I would never have sex with a girl I am not seriously dating.   Depends on the scenario.   If there was a reasonable threat I would step in physically. I am fully able to handle any physical situation that presents itself.  If she was just uncomfortable, I would ask her if she wanted help. I would not want to make her more uncomfortable though.   Basically, if she was getting verbally harassed it would bleep my radar to keep an eye on her (I have a wife and sisters after all). If things escalated I would physically step in, take charge, and diffuse the scenario with whatever force was needed.   If she is drunk, she cannot consent. Women are equal in value, but usually not in physical strength, build, and demeanor as men. As a soldier, and a southerner I would feel obligated by my code of honor to watch out for any female (or male) in a possibly dangerous situation. This is the life of a sheepdog.   My family recieved food stamps and is still on them.  I rejected any government assistance on moral grounds. I will not take government assistance, because I believe using the coercion of the state to take one person's money and give it to the needy is not compassion but robbery.   I am all for charity. I have in the past accepted charity from my church, and would have no moral issue. That money was given to the church freely. I would *never* accept govt. assistance though.      This is exactly the problem.   If an Uber driver rapes a customer, the company should not be responsible. The company did not rape the customer, the individual driver did. The state should punish him for his act of aggression, and hin alone.   I believe in individual, not collective responsibility.   I have skipped way more than seven meals before. That is why I am a capitalist. Growing up in extreme poverty, in a state that had huge subsidies, and government intervention, I oppose that philosophy with every ounce of my belief.    Mt. Doom.    My nemesis would be Frodo Baggins.   He is establishment in the sense that he has no original ideas. I believe both parties are equally big government, equally militaristic, and equally power hungry. Anyone who supports those ideals is establishment. Folks who actually want a smaller government (like Ron Paul was) are antiestablishment.   It is the biggest thrill of my life for sure.   I remember our DS riding with us.. Quiet, not smiling. When we pulled in, the Kraken was released.    Nope.   Here is a [link](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire) that explains laissez faire capitalism.  We believe there are free market solutions to your problems. Monopolies are nearly impossible to achieve without government help. Many monopolies pop up because the state excessively regulates the industry so that new guys can't get in (think about the Uber controversy).  Labor and consumer protections would come from the private sector. You would have consumer watchdog organizations offering analysis of products. You will also have stupid consumers who buy without doibg theor research, and they woukd have to live with the consequences of buying without research.   When bombs started hitting around me and I was responsible for the lives of two other soldiers besides myself.   Yes, I understand that is how it works now.  That is not how laissez faire capitalists believe it should work.   That is why Romney is not a capitalist. He is a mixed market corporatist.   A market with no government intervention. No Federal Reserve, no minimum wage, no government regulation of the market.   We believe the government should only punish and prevent acts of aggression. Nothing else.   Thank you for your wonderful answer.  How exactly do you see your stream of libertarianism as different from AnCaps? I think I can agree with everything you said. I believe workers should be allowed (not forced) to unionize, I don't see much difference between coop's selling products in a free market and individuals selling products in a free market. Under your system, would individuals not be allowed to own business unless they were cooperative?   No, the individuala in that corporation have those rights and liabilities.   Corporations would not exist as they currently do in a free market system. They get their power from tax breaks and preferential legislation.   I am not against shareholder protection. I am against **all** government involvement in the free market.   No I wouldn't. I did not vote for Romney, or McCain. I voted for Ron Paul in both of those elections.  I will repeat myself. Fuck voting along party lines, I vote for individuals.   Corporations are groups of people.  The point is that corporations don't have rights. Individuals have rights. As capitalists, we do not view the world collectively, but individually.       Thank you!   Capitalists would totally oppose the idea that "corporations are people". In a free market, corporations get no government treatment. We embrace the concepts of individualism.  We (capitalists) would never support bailouts, or any other state intervention. Romney does not think like this.   Because state run healthcare is capitalism?  Romney is as far away from capitalism as FDR or Mr. Obama. Romney supports corporatism.  In a true free market, without legislation benifiting corporations, I doubt Romney would have the status and wealth he does.      I think Romney had a real chance of winning. The reason I am happy to have him out, is because I think he was the biggest threat.  I don't think Bush or Christie has anywhere near that kind of pull.   Probably. Empty heads usually get the nod.   That does not mean I will vote for him. Screw voting on party lines, I vote for individuals.   I am ecstatic. As a libertarian-republican, I adamantly oppose his pseudo-conservatism. He is an establishment republican who would just prolong the current big state republicanism that dominates the GOP.   Now if we could only get Jeb Bush out of the race...     Reuters and BBC are my main news sources. I also listen to NPR pretty regularly. I think the quality of American television news is abysmal. Jake Tapper is pretty good. Fareed Zakaria is decent. I also enjoy John Stossel's show on Fox.   I like getting news from opposing perspectives (which is pretty much everyone, since I am a libertarian). I do *not* like news folks who just use their show to stir up bullshit. I am talking about guys like O'reilly, Hannity, Maher, Morgon etc...   What do you think about their insistence on the reality of class warfare? Is class warfare true? Is it necessary? Is it good? Are there free market solutions to worker exploitation? Where exsctly does Socialist theory go wrong? I realize there are many flavors of socialist thought, but what are some fundamental ways they err? What are your opinions about a socialist society existing within a larger free market? A voluntary association of individuals who buy a large amount of land and establish a society in which means of production are collectively owned, planned economy is established etc..?

Can y'all recommend some good books and articles that would give me a cursory overview of dreaming? I am curious to learn more about what actually happens when we dream, where the content of our dreams comes from, theories about significance of dreams, etc?  Can y'all help.   Not sure where to ask this...  I am looking for repectable books and articles about the psychology of dreams. Most of the stuff I find on google search is hardly respectable.. I am curious to learn about the various theories about the causes and effects of dreams on our psyche...    Combat vet as well. I agree with everything you said.   Which branch launched the largest amphibious assault in U.S. military history?   Find an NCO and relay that the Airmen can't salute properly. I would say that's about the best you can do besides making on the spot corrections.   I would probably just tell their NCO that they have not been saluting properly. Give it time to see if that clears it up.  They are still recruits, so expect some ignorance about customs and courtesies.    Sure,  Peter explains how Christ took our sin upon himself in 1 Pet. 2:24, and 3:18. This is the idea Him taking our unrighteousness and sin-wages, and giving us His right standing in return.  John echoes this idea in 1 John 1:5 (where he explains that there can be no darkness in God the light, thus explaining our separation from God) through 2:3. He explains exactly what Paul said, that Christ is the propitiation for our sins, and that those sins are forgiven through confession.       The reason we apply the RPW (which you will fins explicitly in the last statement of WCF XXI vs 1, that we are forbidden from worshipping any way not prescribed by holy scripture") to worship is because we believe Sunday is the Lord's day, the Sabbath, and we are obligated to keep it in accordance with the explicit way He instituted, lest we dishonor the Sabbath.   We don't apply the same principles to the business aspects of the church, because there is nothing holy, no obligations commanded in regards to budgets, interior designs, etc.   Our church government is not centralized, but very decentralized. It is not independent though. The scriptural precedent for oversight above the local church is found in Acts 15, qhere the Jerusalem Council exercised oversight on the matter of Greekness vs Jewishness.   We believe there is nothing holy or significant about a name. Our name is simply another necessary business aspect of church organization.    Sure,   Romans 3:10-20 outlines that none of us are righteous (or in right standing with God).   Romans 3:21-26 Paul explains the idea of Christ giving us right standing through his sacrifice ( what Paul calls "propitiation through his blood").  Romans 10:9 explaina the way to eternal life as confessing our sins, aknowledgement of Christ's Lordship, and belief hid death and subsequent resurrection.   By virtue of who we are (the original sin that defines us) we face a twofold death. First, a literal death (which is inescapable), and second a death beyond that death. The second death is eternal death, separation from God (who is the essence of life) forever, and banishment to hell.   The path to life is the confession of our sin, and surrender of ourselves to Christ's sovereignty, aknowledging belief in his death on the cross as a substitutionary sacrifice that bore the weight of our second death and his resurrection as a victory over both deaths.    I don't know. I don't care about any sport, none of them add value to my life, so my opinion probably is not too helpful.   A know a lot of vets have trouble transitioning into civilian life for this very reason.    Yes. Shit rolls down hill. If they are yelling at me, it is because they got yelled at.   Even if it is not my fault, a little ass chewin never hurt anybody. Like I said before, the Army is no place for someone with thin skin, or someone who thinks so much of himself that he can't take someone else's ass chewin.   I am looking for books about labor unions, especially labor unions pre-WW2.   I am interested in non-fiction, biographies, fiction, or anything else dealing with the subject.   Well, it is a part of a larger effort to impose composting on the residents.  They are trying to force folks to compost, and fine them for not doing so.   Oh we can take care of that. A few motivational runs, and Drill Sergeant watching every bite you eat, ready to pounce on your ass for even looking at cake proves to be an effective weight loss solution.   Which is why folks with significant sleep issues are subject to discharge. If you have bad sleep issues, they likely won't let you enlist in the first place.      I agree. As long as my supervisor does not try to fire me or take admin action against me unjustly, it would not bother me. They can say what they want, I just listen, agree, and move on. They will forget about the whole thing in fove minutes and so will I.   "I am sorry First Sergeant, I have no idea why he would try to drink windshield washer fluid."  "Subsequent asschewing by Top on the dangers of not properly briefing your soldiers on the dangerous nature of household chemicals."  ^ **Actual conversation I had with my First Sergeant**   I will not miss being chewed out, but I will miss being in an organization with clear directives and clear feedback on my performance of those directives.  I would prefer an asschewing to getting fired.   If you don't aknowledge the texts from your leaders, you can prepare yourself for hell when you come back to work.  We are obligated to answer our phones at all hours of the day, any day.    Either have respect pounded into them, or have thei life made a living hell.   Drill Sergeants have a unique way of stimulating respectful attitudes, even among the most antiauthoritarian of individuals.   We will never have another draft though, at least not in our lifetime. Most soldiers I knoe would not support such a thing anyway. I don't want to go to war with a bunch of guys who don't want to be there, you cannot trust folks like that.   Profitable in the sense that essays can be effective ways to communicate ideas in short form.    I get chewed out regularly. I am in the Army. As a squad leader, I not only get my butt chewed if I make a mistake, but also if one of my soldiers makes a mistake. I even gdt chewed out if I am in the same room as any soldier making any mistake. Since I outrank them, I am held responsible for their behavior.   How do I react? I stand at parade rest, agree with them, take my punishment and move on. The Army is no place for kids with thin skin. Ass chewings are a guarantee in this line of work.   Counting sleep, about 9 on the weekdays.  Sometimes more on the weekends.   Rarely.   After watching my good friend get killed.    Nope. I have very specific reading goals, to-read lists spanning years out from now. For a book to even get on my reading list it needs to be recommended from a respected source.  I get most of my books from the library. I only buy books I know would add value and dimension to my personal library, I have specific qualifications.  I also don't like the idea of subscription boxes.   Many writers, Atwood, Asimov, Chomsky, Umberto Eco and T. S. Eliot included have found essays to be a very profitable way to deal with ideas.    Let's talk about essays. Who are some of your favorite essayists and why?  Also, which essays have had an impact on you?   quiet and pensive.   Nope.   But I was homeschooled, with ample freedom. My mom let me choose my own education route with few exceptions. I think this very experience solidified a love for reading in me.   I never said there were successful current markets. It has never been tried properly. There has always been government overreach.   New Hampshire's free state project is moving slowly towards something close. No income tax, no sales tax, no tobacco tax, no taxi regulations etc.  The internet is a somewhat applicable example of a free market that works pretty well.   We believe acts of aggression to be issues unrelated to regulating the market. Sure, they have an effect on the market, but making slavery illegal does not make the market unfree.   We believe humans have three basic rights, life, liberty, and property. Those rights cannot be infringed upon. You cannot take someone's life in aggression, cannot take their liberty, and cannot take their property. This is not regulating the market, this is protecting liberty.   If I murder the CEO of a large company, would that have some effect on the market? Sure. Does that make murder a free market issue? No. Just because the market is free, does not mean our other rights are nonexistent. Each individual owns himself. You should be allowed to work and sell and buy without state intervention, but you are never allowed to commit acts of aggression. That is the fundamental premise of right libertarianism. The market is free, and you are free, you are simply not allowed to hurt people, own people, or take their stuff.   Slave labor is a violation of the nonaggression principle. It has nothing to do with being a labor issue, it is a basic liberty issue. A libertarian society would operate under the assumption that everything being legal except acts of aggression.  If a child comprehends a contract, and is willing to trade his services in exchange for wages, I am fine with that. We would have to have lawyers that ensure the child understands the contract fully. If he is in any way being coerced into working, it is an act of aggression and therefore illegal. Again, nothing to do with regulating the market. The child must be able to comprehend what the contract means, and left free to quit that association whenever he/she wants. Otherwise, I see no problem with letting them decide if they want to work.  BTW, you will note in my original comment I never said I was a full ancap. I lean ancap. I believe the existence of night watch state is necessary. I believe the state should only intervene to prevent/punish acts of aggression.   I agree with that   Laissez faire capitalism is incompatible with socialism. We believe it *totally* free markets, socialism believes in a planned market.   First, I don't like identifying as an anarchist. I agree that anarchism is a leftist ideal. I prefer the term voluntaryist.   In a totally free market, money would not equal power. You would be free to exchange anything you have for anything another has so long as they agree. You could exchange time, produce, gold, cloth, anything that you can use to barter for another item you want.    I would not classify myself as anarchist, that is a title applied to us by outsiders. I prefer the term voluntaryist.  I am a true capitalist. The market should be totally free.   No, because parents are not holy. They are finite and sinful people just like everyone else. I am not obligated to obey them if their demands are sinful.  God is perfectly holy, so he would never demand anything that was not perfectly holy.    I do not, but I would also like to see such statistics.   I think a lot more people are sympatetic to our cause even if they don't totally identify as ancap (as long as we use words other than "anarchist")   Because he demands it, and as my sovereign Lord who bought me with his blood, I am obliged to obey.   As a libertarian..  Not even remotely. I do in fact believe the government should have no role in infrastructure. I lean anarcho-capitalistic. I am an absolute laissez-faire capitalist.   Vienna sausages on ritz crackers.   I have a to-read list.   If I am headed to my bookshop I will make a shorter list, choosing the books I would like to read most and I give that list to my bookseller. She crosses off the items she does not have in stock, and I pick up the rest.  I usually ask my bookseller if she had recommendations since I last saw her. I take her recommendations into consideration.   U.S.    I understand there is a lot of controversy about the possibility of this leftist party winning.   Who exactly are they? I understand they are leftists, are they democratic socialists or more communistic?  What is their platform?  If they gained power how would Greece change?   Either Tommy Lee Jones or Clint Eastwood.   Yeah, the railroad has some wonderful benefits I have heard.     I am assuming they are gonna make him finish basic now and finish his enlistment obligation without getting out.  Thwt is what return to duty means.   I have read others, the Q'uran and bits and pieces of Buddhavacana.   It was not quantifiable. I do believe faith is a gift of God. All men are dead in soul until he brings them to life. So it is nothing a man can do on his own to instill faith within himself.    Rand Paul is the best option right now IMO.  He is not perfect, but he is certainly not a neocon. I think definitely a step in the right direction, though I wish his father had won more than anything.   He is a religious neocon.   He is a social conservative, outspoken against libertarianism.  Against legalization of cannibis, for affirmative action, vague on foreign policy (by his associates I assume typical neocon).  I am not a huge fan. I am hoping for Rand to run, he is the best option in my book.    I love nonfiction books that explore blue collar work.  I would also like to read novels with blue-collar characters, focused on the struggles of working class life.  	135
