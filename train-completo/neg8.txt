 My god that was hot! Need to fond me a woman like that!   https://31.media.tumblr.com/13e831f322d70b749da50bd461ecf3a5/tumblr_inline_n0y6ceCodW1qirpie.gif Wasn't the one I wanted with the crawling weenies :(   Went to the comments section just to see if anyone would make this reference!  Haha Weiners!!!!   Can confirm. Used to work as a manager at one, and when we cash out the registers, we have to match up the "promos" (coupons) with the sales report.  Too many promos and with nothing to show for it, would look suspicious.   Fucking up bad at work and it looks like, through the cameras, you helped someone steal a couple hundred dollars worth of cigarettes and threatened by management of being charged as an accomplice if the cigarettes or money doesn't show up soon.   I really enjoyed the little easter eggs that littered the pictures. I think that caught my eye more hahaha.   You can make me a fan at everything! ;)  	7
 This is without question the right decision...  ... but there is a tiny, Grinchy part of me that hates denying the American Right another chance to utterly humiliate themselves.   It is *explicitly* about US politics.    A fascinating interview with an expert on the "'Christian Identity' Movement."      What am I to do now?   I read that every time a bald eagle loses a feather, somewhere in America a gay biker ejaculates all over Chuck Norris' beard.   You really have to give the political consultants on Jindal's campaign credit for the timing of this announcement.  The victims of last week's church shooting aren't in the ground yet, the Confederate flag has captured the news cycle this week, and tomorrow is likely to see the release of the Supreme Court's rulings on gay marriage and the ACA.   And, Jindal announces his run *after* the deadline for tonight's evening news.  Jindal's staff is either timing-impaired or *trying* to bury news of his announcement. What's your guess?       Precisely. Example: the Kochs and prostate cancer.    But anyone time someone says the word democracy around here, someone has to jump up and say "we're not a democracy, we're a republic". I honestly am not sure where that impulse is coming from  Fox News "journalists" and AM radio talk-show hosts have been pounding that talking point for years.     And now we know why it's impossible to reason with TeaBots: they're so detached from reality that they can't be reached.   and yet he'll still wave the flag of the Plantation Owners that sent his great-great-grandpappy to die to protect their cotton profits.       More like Ron Paul.   Looks like another MONEYBOMB! stunt.   What race has the highest percentage of gun violence?  The poor.  Stop insisting on seeing things on race lines, and instead take a look in economic terms. The *poor* are the most likely to die from gun violence.  Follow this thought through and you'll realize who profits from promoting, exploiting, and continuing such divisions among the impoverished  and why they will give their all to perpetuate these divisions.      White Nationalists/Neo-Confederates/Would-Be Domestic Terrorists: *America is sick of your shit.* Turn back from your rage and hatred before you wind up like these two did.

Thankfully, that hellish era seems to be coming to an end, though some of the Mods that were hand-picked and installed during that reign of terror and error are still in place.  Forgive us if we are not quick to trust the motives of those who participated in that failed coup of right-wing extremists *against* the actual wishes of the "User Community."   [The Growing Right-Wing Terror Threat](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/opinion/the-other-terror-threat.html?ref=opinion _r=0)   It's getting harder and harder for the American Right to hide who they are and what they support.   And thus women.  I really don't know how any woman (Texan or otherwise) can still bring themselves to vote Republican.   It's only because Texas Republicans care about the lives and health of women so much.  /S   Translation: "It's just another rule we made up with zero input from the user community."         Sounds like solid advice. The only thing I would add is some gold holdings.  Thank you!   Yet, there are no statues of Hitler in London, Paris, or Stalingrad.     You're going to be very surprised in about a year.  Can you clue us in on what you've got planned?     Similar to how Bob Barr and all the right-wingers ran around in the 1990s renaming everything after Ronald Reagan while they could still get away with it.   Britain got over it. The South hasn't.   And he hated those Holstein race-mixers worst of all.   Your thoughts are intriguing.  Do you have any investment advice you'd be willing to share at this time?   ... to his front yard.   You're right, of course.  The complexities of the war get lost in heated internet arguments. I'm as guilty as anyone else. It remains the central event of American history and here we are, 150 years later, still working ourselves into a fury over it. Its shockwaves are still felt today.  Thank you for the brushback. :)   And Murray Rothbard says it's not only ethical but morally justifiable to starve your children to death if you can't be arsed to feed them.  Do you have any inkling of how deep the hole of ***"LIBERTY!!11!!!"***^TM goes?   The South's self-fueled paranoia triggered their own "Lost Cause" secession. It's ridiculous to argue otherwise.  It isn't Lincoln's fault the paranoid, greedy, traitorous, slaving cowards fled the Union at the direction of the Plantation Class and their representatives *months* before Lincoln was even sworn in.   Confederate revisionists only need look in the mirror to find their source of all their woes, but they don't seem to have either the guts, brains, or humility to do so.   Translation: "No, I cannot adequately rebut him."   Baby steps.   Good. It's the flag of sedition and treason against the United States.   Yes, Scott ["I'll Do Whatever the Kochs Tell Me To Do"](http://www.salon.com/2011/02/23/koch_walker_call/) Walker promises "bold leadership."   Yes, we know.

Can you adequate rebut him?   The day that the Neo-Confederates' obsession with this bullshit ends will be the same day a white guy walks into a store and is told, "Fuck off, Whitey. We don't serve your kind here."  That will disabuse all of these "Liberty-Lovin'"^TM Confederate apologists of their "Free Market of Segregation" fantasies, posthaste.   He's another Neo-Confederate trying to cover his ass. What else would you expect?  The extremist American Right isn't going to get away with their horseshit anymore. They've been humored and pandered to for decades by Republicans, Right-Libertarians, and Confederate apologists.  No more.   Did the South make any effort to repay the federal government for all of the federal property they seized by worthless fiat?  Who violated the NAP?  Put that in your Ron Paul decoder ring.    How is laddy formed?   A profound ignorance of our nation's history is one of the defining characteristics of TeaPublicans and Republitarians.   Sorry, pal. That's your monopoly.   "Chabanais" is an extremist right-wing troll who was once inexplicably elevated to Moderator on /r/politics by a previous Mod regime who are largely no longer here (though a few Mods from that dark of era of right-wing censorship of /r/politics content remain, and are as vociferous, unreasonable, and authoritarian as ever.)  He can usually be found over or /r/conservative ranting and raving.   Really? Rand's father and mentor Ron Paul certainly doesn't seem to think so.  [Ron Paul's "The South was Right!" speech.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEC68vTQwP8)   Rand, like his father Ron Paul before him, takes great "LIBERTY!"TM with American history.      Propagating the "Democrats/liberals are coming to take my guns" myth has won groups such as the NRA and its affiliates great fortunes.  *Nobody wants your damn guns. Have as many damn guns as you like. Hell, ask a liberal to the range.*  The more paranoid that the NRA/arms dealers/arms manufacturers can make their audience, the better for their each of their bottom lines. The greater the fear, the greater their profits.  It's astounding how successful they've been all these past decades with their false "CONFISCATION IS IMMINENT!" meme. That myth makes the NRA and Wayne LaPierre a lot of money.    *This message sponsored by Jeb! 2016*   Dr. Ben Carson just went from *zero* chance of winning the GOP nomination to a *-10,000,000* chance of winning the GOP nomination.

Conversation has begun as to the validity of the continuing ban on "MediaMatters.com" as "Rehosted Content."  None of these sites should have been blocked in the first place, and some still remain on the Automoderator's kill list from the days in which the "Rehosted Content" fiat was first issued. Still, this can be viewed as an encouraging development in the struggle to keep Reddit's content ***USER***-controlled and ***USER***-curated.  Here's to a more open discussion of Politics in this forum!      I mean this sincerely: ***THANK YOU*** for the first positive, constructive response I've seen from the Mods in over two years now.   Neither of those sites should ever have been censored in the first place. Hopefully, this is a sign of things to come.  Now, release MediaMatters too, please!   You absolutely have the power to remove *Salon.com* from the censorship list that was deliberately programmed into the Automoderator. The same applies to "Talking Points Memo" and "MediaMatters."  What's stopping the current Mods from recognizing right, as well as reality?  *Salon.com* is ***NOT*** "Rehosted Content."     Why, then, is *Salon.com* auto-deleted as "Rehosted Content," when most of their articles are original content?     it leads to more subjective decisions on our part, which we try and limit as much as possible.  Then how do you explain the continued use of the "Off-Topic," "Not US Politics," and "Rehosted Content" lies which are still employed to censor completely valid content?

Many of them are still fighting the Civil War in their heads (and worse, preparing as if a 'Second Civil War' were imminent.)   I've never understood how/why people fall for the Pauls.  A great deal of their support comes from "The South was Right!!1!" fantasists, which certainly explains a lot.  Don't believe me? [Check out Ron Paul's famous "The South was Right" speech here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEC68vTQwP8)   It's the White Nationalist/Neo-Confederate/Gunbertarian Downvote Militia acting out again.   To his other pocket.   It's getting harder and harder for the American Right to deny their foul allegiances and fetid ideologies.    I don't like the Iraq War but I support our troops.  Did you put a yellow ribbon magnet on your SUV?     Denial is a bigger river than the Mississippi.    That pack of losers gave a country with three times the manpower and industrial capacity a run for their money for four years.  At the cost of 740,000 American lives. That's more than have died in ALL of the military conflicts/wars that America has been involved in, before or since.  Don't expect any sympathy for the Confederate's Lost Cause, or some kind of honorary participation trophy for a useless war which was started by the South's Plantation Class using poor white sharecroppers as cannon fodder.  I don't get why the descendants of these Southern sharecroppers still celebrate their Southern oppressors. Maybe it's fun to play make-believe in order to convince themselves that all the death and suffering actually meant something.  The alternative to recognizing reality must be too heavy a cross to bear.   The fact that they've locked it in place shows they know it shouldn't be there at all.  They recognized this when they took it off the statehouse in the 2000s. But they had to be sneaky and stick it on a memorial instead.   It's just Southern spitefulness in full bloom. That's why it will take a supermajority of 66% of both SC houses to take it down. They deliberately wrote this into law when they "compromised" by taking it off the dome.   740,000 in all, the latest scholarship shows.   rekt   And did any of the Confederate states make any recompense to the federal government for all of the federal property they seized illegally, including Fort Sumter?  No, they didn't did they? The CSA just seized all federal properties for themselves via worthless declarations, didn't they?  Many Right-Libertarians and Confederate apologists make another religion out the "NAP," the "Non-Aggression Principle."  So, whose property rights were violated here first, exactly? And who was it, exactly, that initiated force in violation of these well-established property rights? Who violated the NAP?  These are questions that make Neo-Confederates *very* uncomfortable. Usually, eyes bulging, they'll start sweating and reddening before finally stuttering out a spittle-flicked "S-S-ST-ST-STATES' RAAAAGGGHTS!!11!1!" before storming off like petulant children who *still*, even after 150 years, refuse to acknowledge that they LOST the duel THEY initiated.    I wonder if Gene Wilder brings in his pets for checkups?   American Fundamentalist Evangelicals have a great disdain for Catholics.  And boy, are *they* going to be surprised on Judgment Day.   Maybe He meant, "S Words"   Oh, a link to a Ron Paul affiliated site? Thanks for that.   Ron Paul fans are crying into their pillows right about now.   The unspoken, cut-to-the-bone truth about George Zimmerman's rabid defenders?  ***They idolize him because he actually got to live out their secret "I Took Out a Thug" murder fantasy.***  Honest Zimmerman fans admit this; dishonest Zimmerman fans will lie to you about it.     Rich Southerners didn't care about white lives either. That's why the Plantation Owners and their Confederate government sent all the poor sharecroppers to die to defend their profits.  The Plantation Class was willing to send sharecropping whites to die to protect their black slaves, whose forced labor was the source of the all the Plantation Owners' cotton profits.   Chew on that one, Sons of Dixie: the African slaves' lives meant more to the Plantation Owners than the poor white sharecropping class they sent to fight their battles for them.   That's why it's so strange that the descendants of these same poor white sharecroppers sent to die still wave the flag of their own oppression at the hands of the 1% of their day, the Plantation Owners' Class. They even still fall for the "Southern Pride" and "Southern Heritage" lies that the Plantation Owners invented to justify the war for their Lost Cause.   It's the looney-Moonie paper. They cut publishing to a few days a week when the Church of Unification cut off most of their funding.     Wouldn't you be much more comfortable over at Stormfront?   It seems than Mike "Defender of Duggar-Diddling" Huckabee and Rick "Man-on-Dog" Santorum have a lot in common.    most of us down south have ancestors that fought for the Confederacy . . . I don't see how dishonoring their lives helps heal anything.  Your ancestors were already dishonored when the Plantation Owners sent them to die to preserve their profits.   The Flag of Treason against the United States, still favored by Neo-Confederates and the KKK, deserves to reside in the ashbin of history just like the fetid ideology that birthed it.    the Santorum Sidestep  Where dancers slip and fall.     The Confederate/KKK flag should be coated in Santorum.   Why is the Duggar-diddler defender also defending the Flag of Treason against the United States?   It's also the KKK's favored flag.   I wonder if he uses his Dad Ron Paul's old racist newsletters as rolling papers?  They were rather blunt.   "He's not dead yet! He's getting better!"   Isn't it odd how anything that addresses right-wing authoritarianism in this subreddit is quickly marked "Off-Topic" and pulled?   Ford Prefect: for your own safety, please stay away from Los Angeles!   TIL apologists would justify the LAPD gunning down Ford Prefect.   And if we made them pay for the support of the children whose birth they force, they'd seek to *expand* abortion rather than ban it.   The American Right needs to get over its fetus fetish.  Unfortunately, that fetish still brings them votes. Once it doesn't, and begins to *cost* them votes, the American Right's leadership will suddenly forget all about "honoring a 'Culture of Life.'"  They certainly couldn't give a crap about mother and child post-birth.   If so, it seems that the "don't shoot an unarmed person in the head" policy is more open to interpretation.   At least since Nixon and the "Southern Strategy."  Perceptive Americans never fell for such deceit. Many others have and continue to, however.   Confederate traitors, evidently.   Birther Blake Farenthold is too far to the left for the Tea-Guzzlers?  Popcorn time!     Unable to control the monster they created.   Giggling while masturbating to the thought, most likely.   And the American Right will fight it at every step.   It'll probably be along the lines of their already stated "it was an attack on Christianity!!1!" meme-lie.   Says Huckabee, defender of the Duggar-diddler.   The American Right is quickly losing the power to conceal who they really are and what they really believe.   The "14/88" crowd's newest hero.      "But... but... they just want to protect women's health!"     I guess Ted's counting on receiving "the End Times Transfer of Wealth from the Wicked to the Righteous" that his father and other Christian  Nationalists have foreseen for him.   Nice how they handcuff the corpse.   Isn't it odd how Republicans boast of themselves as "the Party of Lincoln," yet can't even bring themselves to condemn the Flag of Treason?   How about Huckabee's support for the Duggar-diddler?   One who calls the Charleston Church shooting an "accident"?   Uh-oh.   This article is going to piss off Reddit's omnipresent Gunbertarian Downvote Militia.    Were they wrong to feel under assault by Abraham Lincoln? No. Even Abraham Lincoln himself would admit that he forced that fight.  False. Most slave states seceded months before Lincoln was even sworn in.     Good. Someone's got to start calling America's regressive states out on their chicanery.   Money's the one language politicians understand, especially right-wing politicians. They'll eventually to abandon their phony "we're social conservatives and God and Murica" vote-pandering bullshit when dollars, cents, and elections are on the line.  Hopefully we won't have to suffer the Christian Nationalists' delusions of self-superior morality and their accompanying dictates for much longer. America is finally ready to evolve out of it.   Yep. It's what they do. Must make them feel like big, strong Aryan warriors for a moment rather than acknowledge their own shallow, inescapable existences.  	143

 Eden of the East   Never remind me of that. That episode depressed me so much it almost ruined my holiday.   5 Centimetres Per Second is surprisingly great. I also really like When Harry Met Sally and Lost in Translation.   I haven't, but I'll add it to my list and try and watch it soon.   It's really good. The animation is beautiful and it's really well written. It's a very powerful metaphor for love and youth. I don't really know what to day other than it's pretty enjoyable even if you don't like anime and one of my personal favourites.   * Super 8 * 5 Centimetres Per Second * Ferris Bueller's Day Off   It's not nearly as bad as Punisher.   Don't forget James Gunn.   Just watched it. I was kind of disappointed. It only spoils stuff that'll be revealed in the first act of the movie.   He hasn't met him. He's trolling. The Govenor first appears in episode 3x03, not 3x02.   Court of Owls?   As long as he writes it. His dialogue is just so money baby.   As in Mighty Avengers and The Initive. I read the first four issues of The Initive and didn't really like it, but the reading order I'm following lists it as essential. Is it worth giving it another shot?   5 Centimetres Per Second is a beautiful and unique romanitic film.  The Garden of Words is by the same director, but it's not as good.  Lost in Translation is an odd one as there's nothing particularly special about the way it's shot, but it looks beautiful.  Wes Anderson has a keen eye for visuals, I'd recommend The Grand Budapest Hotel, Moonrise Kingdom and Fantastic Mr Fox.  I haven't seen it, but I hear the Assassination of Jesse James is quite pretty.  This is probably not what you're looking for, but the works of Edgar Wright rely on visual humour a lot. The best examples of this are seen in Scott Pilgrim vs The World and The Three Cornettos trilogy.  It's probably in part due to the general atmosphere, but there are some shots in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly that are so hard sketched into my mind.  And finally, the obligatory not a movie comment - Hannibal, Pushing Daises and True Detective.   That's actually just from Iron Man. Warren Ellis' excellent Extremis arc.  Also: charge your phone.   This should give you a pretty good understanding of the entirety of the MCU.

Edit: Added Star Wars   Yes. Did you read any of them?   As in Mighty Avengers and The Initive. I read the first four issues of The Initive and didn't really like it, but the reading order I'm following lists it as essential. Is it worth giving it another shot?   So, when's part two?   There were four Superhero movies last year. Four. Seriously. Why are people acting like that's too many? There are plenty of other options.   He toned it down in Jurassic World. He really wasn't that Andy Dwyer-ish. But, the movie was so silly I barely noticed.    He starts when he's thirteen. Interestingly, people thought he was too young for adults to associate with so they had a time skip so he was 15.   Pascal would have made a great Dr Strange IMO. This is a given considering both Strange and Pedro are sexy mother fuckers.    You need someone butcher and stronger for Cable in my opinion. Perlman is too old, otherwise he'd be my first choice.   My only problem with the inclusion of The Punisher is the fear that it may mean we won't see Elektra, the Hand, Bullseye or - much more importantly- Stilt Man.   Yeah. It's better to wait and use him well then use him poorly.   The word hero. The Inhumans are just people.   Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Suzie in Sex Criminals     He'd only be good if they were going for adventurer Mr Fantastic rather than troubled scientist Mr Fantastic which is his more modern depiction. For the latter, Teller is perfect as he'd be playing the same role as in Whiplash with science in lieu of drums.   I don't think think a Transmetropolitian film would be a blockbuster, but Imd very much like one.   What issue is this?   I fully expect a ton of these covers to be commissioned next month.   McConaughey almost exclusively plays characters with inner demons. I think I'd cast Dancy for the same reasons I'd cast McConaughey.   I just finished watching the third episode of this season and I'm not too sure. He seems too weird and I think I'd struggle accepting him as some kind of space messiah, he doesn't seem wise enough and I'm not sure he'd make an entirely convincing action star. I don't think he'd be the worst choice though.   Sorry, did I misspell a word?   You misspelt Matthew McConaughey.    With Co-Op?   I can't stand the Looper rules, but here it works better. I really wouldn't want another parallel universe story.    I consider it a fan theory as Kendrick in his albums is a charcter, but a character loosely based on a real person. I've made this analogy elsewhere in the thread, but it'd be like saying Zuckerberg killed some in The Social Network. Whether it applies to real life, I'm unsure, but I believe it applies to his albums.     If you like Prisoners, you'll love Mad Max, Interstellar and the Avengers. Actually, I'm not too clear, do we like the Avengers anymore?   The pay off is still there, it's just a post-credits scene.    The Garden of Words is a beautifully animated Japenese film directed by Makoto Shinkai. It's about a teenage boy who falls in love with a young woman he meets at a park bench every morning. The animation is phenomenal and it has a similar nostalgic tone to Lost in Translation. The dub is surprisingly good and the actors carry a lot of emotion, in case you didn't want to watch it subtitled. It's only 45 minutes, so don't be surprised if you find it short.  [Here's the trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoA4vYlfoc4)  Edit: I forgot, there's a crucial post credits scene, that you really can't miss otherwise you miss the payoff for the past forty minutes.   The point of it is, it adds another layer to the complexity of the character that is Kendrick Lamar.  Also, that's a unhealthily dismissive attitude to murder.   I didn't actually, but thanks. I got it from [here,](http://www.djbooth.net/index/news/entry/2015-04-20-kendrick-lamar-kill-someone) and I just wanted to share.   Did you not know Jay-Z's a motherfucking monster?  Seriously though some very good points here and even if Kendrick did kill someone, he'd be wiser for it and I wouldn't think it worth debating whether he's a good person nowadays.   What else has he done that's notable.   Frank Miller's art is NOTHING without Klaus Janson.   They're still good - just not on par with the series. They're a little rushed and don't really stand alone very well. Whether the conclusion is satisfactory or not is also really debatable. I liked it, but I know many didn't. All kind of makes sense seeing as the movies were the disused plot of season two.   I really liked it, but I was a bit disappointed by the movies. Otherwise it's great.   The point of the article isn't that you should judge him for it, more about wondering about how it affected him if he did.   A) I didn't write this.  B) I'm not really a fan of the analogy either. It's kind of inappropriate here.   Isn't it ironic, that if he did kill someone, Kendrick may be a better man for it?   Sorry, Le Fram Bruhs?   What's even circle jerky about this?   What's the circlejerk? This is just an analysis.   [What a douchebag.](https://themonthlyspew.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/3036582-2021834-1803127_cyclops_douche_super_super.jpg)   Then follow it up with Whedon's Astonishing X-Men. It's a bit more of a light-hearted fair, but it's just as good, if not better and I view it as a sequel of sorts.   My biggest problem with the otherwise great New X-Men is the art was too cartoonish compared to how darkly Kyle and Yost were writing it. Children were getting murdered left, right and centre yet it still looked like an all-ages book.    And the widescreen panels. And the black boxes.   Is We Are Robin any good?   The way I see it, in his albums Lamar is a character based on a real person; like Zuckerberg in The Social Network, certain elements are fictitious and exaggerated, but there's a lot of truth there and they both feel a lot of regret. Is this regret sourced from this murder is the question on my tongue.    Like I said I really dig your theory and I want to listen to albums again and look at it with another perspective.  First thing I started to do after reading this. Working my way through MaaD City now.   I hope he acts in his films. Lots of untapped potential in there. Also, nice Bad Meets Evil reference.   So many places you go with it (literally). Its premise could lead to almost anything.   Decent list I guess. Some things I don't like, but that's expected. I personally would have included Eden of the East, Hunter X Hunter and some movies. Akira, GitS, 5 Centimetres Per Second, Princess Monoke, Spirited Away and The Garden of Words would be my main picks for movies.   Regardless of your feelings towards those shows - I dislike Sword art and Black Butler, but love Deathnote - these are pretty great starting points and anything to get people into the better stuff is good in my opinion.   Jesus fuck! That's scary as shit!   Completely pinched from this [source](http://www.djbooth.net/index/news/entry/2015-04-20-kendrick-lamar-kill-someone), but I really wanted to share it.   He watched House Party and ate Apple Jacks, sold Sega games while his cousin sold crack, pumped Reeboks while his uncle pumped packs. Since his introduction to the world, Kendrick Lamar has been the good kid from an ugly city. He embraced his roots, accepted being a boy from the hood, painting himself as Tre instead of Doughboy. Since birth, he was inducted into the madness. Weve seen the album cover, a baby at a table with a 40 next to a baby bottle. Heard the tales of his homies, how he witnessed their departure into darkness. He couldve been them. Somehow, he stayed away from the gangs. Kept his head in a notebook instead of rolling up papers. He left Compton untainted, a survivor, and told the world his story. Just as Obama became a symbol for hope when he was elected, Kendricks story has made him into an example for kids living in the same jungle.     What if Kendrick wasn't always so good? What if something traumatic happened that changed his life?     *Been feeling this way since I was 16  The Blacker The Berry*      *If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me? Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street*  M.A.A.D City      *So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street, when gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me*  The Blacker The Berry      *As a kid I killed two adults, Im two advanced*  Hol Up      *My innocence been dead*  Ab-Souls Outro    When Kendrick sat down with Rob Markman of MTV to discuss TPAB, he brought up the last line of "The Blacker The Berry" and Kendrick said his lyrics are from his experiences, his real life. I been through a lot, I seen a lot, where I come from, Ive done a lot to tear down my own community, he said. I wanted Rob to dig deeper. What, exactly, had he done to tear down his community? Kendricks face shows theres something hes keeping below the surface. As soon as you even allow yourself to ponder the idea, to consider even the hypothetical scenario that Kendrick has truly murdered another man, your brain starts to shut down. Its like if Batman killed the Joker, no one would believe it. That goes against his moral code, no matter what the crime or criminal, theres a line he wouldnt cross. Or, maybe more accurately, a line we think he wouldn't cross, as if we really know his life, as if we really know Kendrick Lamar Duckworth.     If these were Bobby Shmurda lyrics there would be no doubt. They would match his image, a young man that turned his reckless lifestyle into rap music. When Bobby said Mitch caught a body a week ago it was more than a catchy lyric, we all believed him. The police believed him. Yet, Kendrick says he killed a man, and we mask it as metaphorical. Assume its conceptual, that hes speaking from another perspective. And it very well may be...but what if he's not? Just allow yourself to think if for a moment. Kendrick has also insisted that the stories he tells are real ones, although not always his story. But what if he really did shoot someone? What if gangbanging really did make him kill someone? Even if he confessed the entire story, would you believe him?     On "Sherane," Kendricks mom tells him, If he keeps fuckin around in the streets, he wont make it to the next grade, 11th grade. Between 10th and 11th grade you're likely 15 or 16 years old. This time period seems to hold great significance. This is when hes breaking into homes, smoking weed and roaming the streets in his mommas van. He's been in circles that were causing mayhem in the streets, at the age of nine he was hanging with a crew of kids packing vans with guns and seeing someone get their brain evicted from the skull. Not saying he was active, but Kendrick is able to document the mad city because he was in the heart of it. Flags didnt hang from his back pocket, but his affiliation with friends likely threw him into dangerous situations and scenarios. One unlucky night was around each corner, grandma staying in the wrong neighborhood could lead to guns drawn and bullets soaring. Kendrick went from being a product of his surroundings to escaping through music. Something triggered this mentality change, what if the change was brought because he killed someone? Imagine if the ending of GKMC is fictional, instead its like Boyz In the Hood except Tre doesnt get out the car. You got a bunch of boys, filled with rage, who just witnessed a friend die. I believe they got revenge before an old woman with holy water baptized them.     *And if this bottle could talk* (gulp) *I cry myself to sleep*    *Bitch everything is your fault*     *Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend*     *Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed*     *I know your secrets*     *Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin'*    "U" is Kendrick at his most personal. Its chilling how he was able to convey such emotion. The song highlights his faults, moments where he let himself down. Failing as a role model, failing as a brother, failing as a friend, confessing his suicidal thoughts, it all pours out of him like punctured blood vessels. That last verse it seems like hes about to make a confession, but instead decides to chug from the bottle. An incident that shook him to the core, an altercation that couldve lead to confinement. He carries an immense amount of survivors guilt, its apparent on a good portion of TPAB, but it feels like hes haunted by more than just escaping. Through music hes seeking redemption for the all the wrongdoings in his past. By becoming a beckon of light, he stops the cycle that stole his friends, enemies and his innocence.     *"Yesterday I invaded privacy of a home*     *The day before that my partner had fronted me a zone*     *A week before I had loaded bullets inside that chrome*     *Two weeks before that I shot them bullets and he was gone*     *A month before that I cursed my mother then slammed the door*     *Six months before that I hit my woman, she hit the floor*     *I stormed out then seen a black Honda Accord*     *Them hollow tips missed me then hit that little boy"*    Theres a song called His Pain on BJ The Chicago Kids mixtape, Pineapple Now   Laters, that I always felt shouldve been placed on Section80. The title is fitting and Kendrick completely dominates the song with a grief stricken performance. He raps three verses before BJ even appears on the song. The hook is Kendrick repeating, I don't know why He keep blessing me, while illustrating the cold world that hes currently trapped in. The second verse, he talks about home invasions, murder and domestic violence. Hes talking loading bullets and blasting, being shot at, surviving but a stray bullet hitting a bystander. We can assume this is incredible creative writing, or incredibly candid storytelling. In the third verse he says, I analyzed on how a saint can play the villain, self-reflecting on who he is, and who he is becoming right before having a revelation. He believes God blessed him so he can bless us. Thats the Kendrick Lamar mission. To redeem himself by using his life to redeem others.     This is the theory that my buddy Kelechi and his brother Ukandu brought to my attention in a group text. I was in denial when they first shared the evidence, claimed it all as reaching, but its hard not to at least seriously consider once all the dots connect. The text thread is literally full of countless oh shit, fuck and you have to write this. It feels dirty to even think. Kendrick is hip-hops golden child. We finally had a rapper that wasnt just about money, bitches and violence, his thoughts are bigger than the clichs, and I would hate to taint his image with mistakes made during adolescence. I respect the fact that he puts it out there, like an Easter egg for listeners to find. Something happened during Kendricks 16th year, possibly an accident, maybe self-defense, but it changed him forever.    I know friends that come from good homes, great parents and still get tangled up with the wrong crowds. The kind of guys that never break into homes but stand outside as lookouts. They wouldnt rob a bank, but they have been a part of check fraud. This is how I always imagined Kendrick, flirting with danger, but never gave into the temptation. If he held a pistol, it was unloaded. He got fired from his job after being pressured to stage a robbery. This isn't the kind of guy that is expected to be a kingpin of crime. I figured he spoke as a witness, he rapped from the perspective of an observer. Thats the person I connected with, who I rooted for. He symbolized overcoming a life in a rough environment. The thing about being a rap fan, the lyrics are sacred. We spend time dissecting and separating the real, phony, and exaggerations. His stories were real, but when he touched on subjects that seemed out of character, I dismissed them as just that - Kendrick channeling a character. Now, things have changed a bit. The information isn't new, it's always been there, I'm just now seeing the puzzle with all the pieces.     Now this is not an article saying that Kendrick did it; as much as the police are increasingly trying to blur the lines, as much as rappers try to blur the lines, song lyrics are art, not confession. But ever since the day I first started thinking about this article, I was lookin at him different.    I just really like their relationship in the comics and find their banter amusing.   Well, Civil War had more consequences than most events (its inpact was still felt until 2010). My problem is the fact it is incredibly poorly written and so many people act out of character.    That's a shame. I was really hoping he'd be in Doc Strange.   He got the Iron Spider gear in The Amazing Spider-Man months beforehand and he's barely in the main book itself and his role is really inconsequential. Anything notable that happened to him in that arc was retconned out a year later.  I really don't like Civil War. It's honestly one of Marvel's worst event books and that's truly saying something. I'm sure this movie will be good though.   His role in the comics was a bit part. He only appears on about ten pages.   Agreed, but DC needs more series with female characters headlining.   Batgirl isn't really Justice League, but the others would be great, but it seems kind of unlikely as they've already confirmed seven members and that's the traditional amount the League has. Martian Manhunter is a shapeshifter, so - if they include him - he could be depicted as a woman, like Xavin in The Runaways.    Your average Bloomingdales mannequin has more talent and charisma than Tatum.   Personally, I feel the franchise was better for it.   What I find interesting is Buffy is just a Kitty Pryde (an X-man) rip-off.   The superlative season.   The finale of Dexter - never again.   No, but not many blockbuster franchises do. At least the MCU has a lot of surprisingly good and very entertaining.   Damn straight.    When do I watch this in relation to the 2008 series?   I didn't realise how good DC have been about this. Probably because the Justice League in the comics is mostly white. Not sure whether Ezra Miller would identify himself as a person of colour though and Green Lantern and Shazam are yet to be cast.  Edit: It could still be less of a sausage fest though. Maybe a female Green Lantern to make up for the years of fridging    Does anyone else.   What I find impressive about the MCU is they've not had any movies that bad. How many other ten-film franchises can you name where the worst film is just mediocre?   But, it did. Clearly, it did.   Why? I love both movies, but I'd give F F7 the edge because the protagonists aren't all white (Sam Jackson is a bit player).   No superheros? Short of the capes, Toretto's gang have been superheroes since the fifth one. They're basically an ethically diverse Avengers with mad driving skills in lieu of powers    I don't even think it's for gear heads anymore. They haven't had a straight up race since the fifth one. It's more like The Avengers where all their superpowers are being good at driving.   My mixed race friend told me to play down my race because I use the word "nigga" casually.   Race.   I kinda want it to be Doc Strange as their relationship in the comics is superb.   No, he's not. He was hired because the director wanted that actor. That's it.   The argument has never been about Peter - it's more about representation.   That was never even in question.    Well, Idris sure is sexy, but I'm not sure he could pull off the flirtatious banter with every other Avenger.   Who's most famous role to date was the incredibly camp Peter Allen. I hear he was great in that though.   No, they don't. Do you think so little of casual movie-goers? This is the 21st - where no-one should bat an eye at siblings of different races. Half of drama is making assumptions about characters, I don't see how this is any different.  All that matters is that Johnny and Sue treat each other as siblings and love each other. That should be enough for the casual audience member to understand.   Watch Whiplash - Teller's character is essentially Reed Richards with drumming replacing science.   Seriously, they should have given Elba a much larger role. The fucker could have played anyone of the Avengers well (apart from Hawkeye).   You know, the fact that they're adopted probably isn't going to be mentioned in the film    Too old.      A movie that pays homage to 80's movies. Like Drive or John Wick.      I'm not doing this with you.   Any chance for a Punisher team-up?   Personally, I think Dances with Wolves is a more interesting story, but Avatar is a superior movie. Sorry to use the obvious example, but sometimes it's the best one.   No, let's speculate. A serious homophobia accusation might be what it takes to kick him out of DC.  I'm more than willing to drag myself down to his level to be shot of him.   I'm fond of Gravity is a Western. It features a lone, mostly silent protagonist travelling though a desolate and barren landscape where danger is around every corner.   Do you have the bigger editions? Is it just me, or was KnightsQuest just run-of-the-mill Batman stories with Azreal's descent into madness being the only interesting thing about it? I love KnightFall and KnightsEnd though.   Honestly - as much as I love them - most Superhero comics are the equivalent of dumb blockbusters. Image and Vertigo is pretty much the place to be if you want intelligent writing.   It seems like your comparing a single issue of a comic to an entire series or novel, which I'd disagree with. A 22 page comic is going to have limitations, but when six issues come together to form a trade,  then this would be more apt as they have just as much room to develop characters and stories. If "limited dialogue" is just something you've experienced in comics, I'd point you towards something wordier. Some comics average a hundred words a page where others average ten. I also feel characterisation can be conveyed through emotions and reactions which illustrations deliver with ease.   Nope. The only advantage that TV has is length and novels' prose. Prose can easily be replicated by comics though and comics have the ability to display things happening at different times simultaneously and have many other tricks that give them an advantage (not to mention budget). Google Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics. A great read that really gives more insight into art in general.   Link?  	116
 Slowly but surely I've seen popular posts on /r/MensRights et al. go from content that affects men, to childish bitchfests about double-standards and anti-feminist circlejerks.  I just want a sub where I can read and discuss issues that affect men without it devolving into abject rage about the opposite gender. Fuck me, right?

Turns out I was walking next to Oly Murs, and they thought I was famous too. I wasn't.  2. Great place to meet random people. I'd go out with some American buddies of mine and we'd inevitably end up back at my flat with a few people to do copious amounts of whatever drugs we had on us.   3. Once saw a muslim man getting dragged down a dark alley, screaming for his life. Called 999, but the guy let the muslim man go when he saw me on the phone.   4. Great place for picking up women. Especially Aussie women, for some reason. Maybe they're just easy.    Wait... ACTUALLY!?    dickshonary  22edgy1974me   Denise the downer? Really?   I'm more sick and tired of people telling me they went to school with Tadasha (T-A) and Ladasha (L-A). NO YOU DIDN'T. NO YOU FUCKING DIDN'T.    I'm not making any direct comparison per se. More a contrasting example of what a good CEO looks like and how they treat their employees.

He is a total nutjob, but the fish you're holding has been a part of that dive pretty much since it's inception. Can't remember his name, but he has one, and he's doing just fine. We've been worldwide leaders in conservation since we first protected the green turtle in 1620. Touching a few snapper isn't going to hurt anyone, and in fact the only reason that snapper is still around is because the area you dove in is protected against fishing. If I had a friendly snapper come up to me like that anywhere else, you'd be damn sure he wind up with a spear through his gills.   I actually worked with this dive company for a summer. Lived in Bermuda my whole life. We are miles ahead of the world when it comes to marine protection. We first protected turtles in 1620 and have always had strict catch limits. The fish OP is holding has been a part of that dive since it first started. Nothing's ever happened to it.   Literally JUST posted about this same thing! Horses know their way home.   There's actually an old story in my country of two brothers and their horse.

Every time, they'd wake up back in their driveway, and give the horse the day off.   ... you take the chains off.   Unfortunately all of that is wayyyyyyy outside our budget :(   ^   HA! Amazing.

Not quite. Never went to college. Worked my whole life as a reporter.   The "one man band" you're describing is a new role in news, but that's by no means the typical journalist these days.

Hey GOP, nobody cares about Ben...what's it called?   Isn't "using in vitro fertilization" something that women do much more often than men? If so, might there be an argument that this has a disproportionately disparate impact (is a discriminatory law) towards women?   You are right that CMC just reports and that it shouldn't choose. However, in these still-early days of crypto, that's really where a lot of people discover coins. So if a coin is not listed there, then it really doesn't have much following. If cryptos were more popular and widely used, then CMC would not have such a large influence by merely listing them, so my speculation about future corporate coins is just that...speculation.    That is weirdly terrific, actually.    Washington is utterly corrupt. It would be funny if they served pink chicken and everybody got sick. Would the laws come out differently then?   Quite possibly the most beautiful place I have ever been.    Fair enough. I wasn't saying lower salaries necessarily lead to corruption, but it is a factor to consider when these folks hold society's power to enforce the rule of law.    What a shot. Those were some empty bleachers, too.    Coin market cap should be for truly decentralized currencies. If Bank of America or Walmart started its own coin, would CMC list that?   It's not a matter of the education. This is a tough job with a lot of responsibility and these folks go through very rigorous testing and training. If they're making a lot less than $100K, then they'll be just as dishonest and dirty and corrupt as law enforcement officers in many other countries. You don't want that.    Good for them.   Probably people from other cryptos who monitor this space looking for a chance to knock the grand vision of BitShares.    I would hope so.

                                  TAP needs to their fares online.  What frustates me the most about TAP is that it is hard for me to load non light-rail fares on Metro buses and non Metro buses. But, I am also considered disabled due to autism so I fall under a different pricing system than most Metro riders which complies.                  So the obvious that we have known for years is actually true.      One advantage about OCTA compared to Metro is that it is great to have county-wide public transit system. One pass, one bus system.  Despite my prefereance for Metro over the OCTA, I do no understand why there is so many transit agencies in LA County.  There should be only four in my opinion: LBT, Antelope Valley, FTA, and Metro because those bus systems serve vast population bases.     Yeah, Metro is a far better cry than OCTA.  Here in OC, we have no light rail and it is impossible to access the bus in certain parts of the county.  If you live in Santa Ana, Anaheim, or Costa Mesa, than the best comparison to OCTA is how Long Beach Transit operates.  For the rest of the county (especially in the South), RTA is a better comparison.  But Metro is superior to the OCTA and LBT.                                                                           What a waste of legislation.   Tell Ted Cruz to go blow it!/                                                      Hehehe                                                            It has taken me three weeks and three separate to the DMV to get a new ID card. I lost my card after getting it five days later. What happened turned into three DMV visits, losing a job opportunity due to lack of I'd, and tremendous amount of wasted time.  And the DMV has stilled has not issued me a new card. Anybody has dealt with a such nitemare.               Extreme personal integrity.   How is it different than using normal DMT?      As an aspie, how do you think about all of these people participating in the massive fundraisers for autism like this held in Pasadena.  (http://abc7.com/society/families-friends-gather-for-walk-now-for-autism-speaks-at-rose-bowl/668403/)  My attitude is like Meh.  The problem about these fundraisers is that they are trying to spend massive amounts of money of trying to autistic people into neurotypicals.  I think the money is better spent on educating the public about autism and how to deal properly with autism.  I think the money should go into teaching social skills to autistic people so they learn how to interact with people, but also teach NTs that autistic people have a unique way of communicating and learn how to respect it. I am much more of the high functioning end of autism where my autism allows for normal social relationships with NTs but I still also suffer from severe ADHD that is also the root at my autism.  My ADHD and not my social skills is what holding me down in the professional workplace.   I would also like the money to spent on teaching self-awareness skills as well, but not at the expense at trying to change  who autistic people.         And there is a guy on my reference list that can state that he has never seen me drink for the last 21 months.  And he has my landlord that lives in my house.  And he also knows that I go to meetings.    They are real big flag.  That is why I prefer not to talk about them.  However, I am extremely active in twelve-step recovery programs which is the only real way that I can reassure employers that my DUIs are behind me.  And I do have over two years in recovery.   In two recent job submissions, I used the third paragraph of my cover letter to discuss the soft skills that I would bring to the company.  I found that this article has fiveteen different soft skills that you can use in your cover letter to sell an employer on your soft skills in  a cover letter  (http://www.forbes.com/sites/kensundheim/2013/04/02/15-traits-of-the-ideal-employee/   Somebody needs kick that entire legislature out of power and replace it progressives.  These guys are making NC return to Jim Crow days.            The problem is that renewing the license requires ownership of a car.        I left a high-paying government job after ten years of working there because I could no longer maintain the security clearance. I was never fired and I left my own accord.  I got two DUIs in a year.    In my application, I put the reason why I left my job was for "Personal and Health" reasons. I do not provide the details unless asked.  WHen I do, I tell the employer that I have two years in clean in twelve step programs.  I do not explain any of the details of DUIs, but rather that I have two year clean today and I no longer drink.  I also participating in an unpaid internship for autism people that helps with my soft skills which actually has helped me a lot.   The question: Is being honest with the employer and reassuring to the employer that I am in recovery with multiple years of clean time is this best thing to do?   I have two DUIs from 2012. My license is no longer suspended, but I do not have a car. I have enough money in the bank to immediately buy a car in cash with applicable insurance. I have also have to get special insurance that costs a little bit more.  I have no other moving violations on my record.  How can I tell employers that I can immediately get car once I hired and meet the requirements for a valid Class C license.                I think he has something to do with.  Paul is speaking about the natural cycle of boom and bust in the market.  The market will always will have down cycles and I think this is what Paul is speaking about.

Yes, Mumia is convicted cop killer but there is substantial doubt on the conviction's basis.   Based on the recent rash of police abuse towards Blacks, Mumia claims of innocence might be actually be correct or more realistically, the murder was caused by the police officer's own actions that resulted in manslaughter than pre-meditated first degree murder.    For me, Mumia is commentator on social justice issues and that is why I listen to him.  The legal circumstances of his case are of no concern to me.  The Philadelphia police had an extensive track record of discriminatory behavior towards African-Americans especially during the times of Mumia case so the allegations against are considered to be murky and unresolved in my opinion.        Those police need to be sentenced to California Department of Corrections and placed in general population.     Life on prison. The US death penalty process is too much of a boondoggle to work effectively.

 If you're doing it on an emulator, I'd get a prepatched version from www.fantasyanime.com  You'll get better translations and just some bug fixes overall.   I find VI to be a very great game that takes a lot of what the series has done and improves upon it (like a long standing series should do). I would go with IV first just because its a little shorter and a great playthrough. VI will give you great bang for the time spent playing. Personally, my favorite in the franchise.   Yup.

 Getting punched in the eye at 3am while gently slumbering   Why is this so far down? Here, have an upvote from 65,000,000 B.C   The first is 3. After that its 2 each level applied   That looks like a pretty solid possibility! All I've been able to find thus far is a 'plank' of bamboo. Thanks!   I managed to find some wooden bookshelf pegs that are exactly the same size and shape as my mekugi, but they feel much softer. I am hoping that Tozando wouldn't commission their iaito parts from Ikea. I'm in the US.    Howdy,    Recently my iaito (Tozando Toryumon series) has had some looseness in two areas. It started with tsuba rattle which I repaired by making an extra seppa out of thin brass sheet and by tapping the inner diameter of the tsuba with a punch. This fixed the problem, though after a couple of days I could feel some looseness between the nakago and tsuka, especially during suburi. I added a thin cardstock shim inside the tsuka which worked for a few days but now the nakago/tsuka looseness is back and is making a creaking sound.  I have consulted my instructor and he is heading to an aikido seminar later this month where there will also be a person who repairs iaito. He will be bringing my iaito with him to be looked at.   I have stopped using it and it is being looked at by someone with more expertise than I.  That being said, would this nakago/tsuka looseness (And the associated creaking sound) be a result of worn mekugi? It does show visible wear. I cannot for the life of me find replacement mekugi at all, let alone mekugi that I can shape to my specific tsuka/mekugi-ana. All I've been able to find is smoked bamboo stock or "Use a chopstick". I'd rather not use a chopstick or bookshelf pegs, etc. I'd like to stick to smoked bamboo and ensure that I'm not damaging my iaito or creating an unsafe practice space.   Any leads on where to find decent mekugi? Also any idea what, if not the mekugi, is causing this looseness and creaking?  Thanks!   There was an Adams Family cartoon episode about this.

 I was in the hospital for a few days a month ago because I fell down two flights of stairs and there was weird shit because of it. Anyways, the guy in the room next to mine was pretty old and I'm assuming he was in for some kind of accident. The nurse was talking to him and said he can have percocets, lortabs, or dilaudid. When he said percocets I cried a little.    That's fair. I just use my phone's data if my wifi is shitty at the time, but  I can see where a folder would come in handy   I've tripped countless times on dph, so my answer is that it effects everyone differently, and where some people get a nightmare of a high, other actually get something enjoyable. I always just get really cool visuals covering the walls and some confusion. Never anything that terrifies me.    Am I the only person that never downloads porn? Is the Internet not good enough for you scoundrels?    TIL a missile can be shot down using the same power that it takes to cook two hot pockets    I'm very experienced with dph, especially high doses. As for hbwr, I've gone through about 100 seeds, so I'm sure I can offer some advice. With dph I've only noticed the body load take its form in the feeling of intense gravity. Aside from that it just makes me clumsy. With hbwr I didn't get either affect, but I got insane leg cramps a few times. As far as using them for sleep, I do have something to say. Dph is very good with that. Since I built up a tolerance I take about 200-300mgs for sleep, and get absolutely no hallucinations. It really just helps me feel sleepy, as well as keeps me sedated while trying to fall asleep which helps. As for hbwr, I tried taking high doses of that, close to 20 seeds each time. It completely changes the high at a dose like that. I went from euphoria to complete sedation. Almost every time I would be asleep within two hours of ingestion.   Edit: after rereading the question, I'll actually answer what you asked. For me, I don't trip until I hit about 600mg of dph. Between that and 900mg I just get a good fun high. Melting walls,  stuff like that. Above that is where I start getting fucked up thought loops and closed eye hallucinations, where I'm in a totally different place usually. Also I tend to black out after 1g and then wake up with no memory and weird little hints of the stupid shit I did around the house.   Lsa is touchy and varies trip to trip. I had an amazing trip on it once, I think around 14 or so seeds. I was so euphoric it was insane and I loved ever second of it. However, I've taken doses right around there other times that end up with nothing happening. I've also noticed that between 10-17 seeds is where I experience the worst cramping.   If you're looking for a solid definite high, I'd suggest dph. As long as you're familiar with what doses do what to you, as it varies person to person, you'll be fine. I've never experienced any negative side effects from it. I wake up refreshed the next day. Although, I do usually have shakey hands the next day after.    I was once at a party on April 20th a few years back. Now being 4/20, it was basically a weed party because my friend group was very much into smoking back then. So I was talking to this girl and she said she'd come, but she brought a friend who was also a mutual friend to one of my friends girlfriends (I'm sure that made no sense). Anyways, they knew it was a night of smoking lots of bud and camping, and still came. I guess they weren't really into weed, so the three girls split a half a bottle of vodka. Now here is where shit gets shitty. I'm standing there just giggling at some nonsense because I was pretty baked. This girl, who I had never even met before this, looks up at me and says, "you're a drug addict and I hate you."   I was so shocked because it came out of nowhere and at that point I hadn't ever done anything other than  smoke weed. No alcohol, pills, even cigs. On top of that, this girl knew what we were doing there. It's not like she was shocked to see this drug use. So I just brushed it off, because whatever not letting her kill my fun.   The next morning she texts me and apologizes and blamed it on being drunk. At that point of the night the probably took a shot each. Clearly she was just being a dick head. But I accepted her apology because why make a big deal out of something so small.   That said, I've never forgotten it. I was never so offended in my life by someone's words at that point. "You're a drug addict, and I hate you." The fuck is that shit?    Never met him in person, and only had brief contact via Facebook once. Basically he and my mother did their thing on high school, and when he found out she was pregnant he joined the army and never looked back. About a year after I was born my mom was arrested for drugs (heroin I think)  and I was sent to live with my grandma. I still occasionally see my mother, but I can honestly say that I absolutely do not feel for her at all. No love, no anger, no hatred, but she's fucked up several childrens' lives, so I've done my best to keep her out of mine. As for my father, he never tried to meet me or anything, but he did pay support without ever defaulting or trying to get it lowered or whatever. Now he lives several states away with a wife and two daughters from what I've heard. So i have nothing against the guy, but can't say I like him or anything. Can't say I've given him much thought throughout life.    Probably not the worst, but a couple of days ago my friend had his bong sitting on a little table we were all sitting around. He was excitedly telling a story and went to motion to something with his hand and smacked the bong off the table. As soon as I heard the shatter of his glass and his heart I just started nervously laughing for about five minutes while he cleaned the pieces of the piece off the ground.    I'm in the process of helping  a family member move from Philadelphia to Nashville, so once we finish the drive we'll spend the day unloading the truck. Just passed through Knoxville, and god damn is this state beautiful. Especially the sky. They don't make clouds like this where I'm from.    I'm not sure why, but when someone calls soda 'pop' it drives me fucking crazy. Calling it coke doesn't bother me at all, but pop? Pop!? What is this, the fifties? Boils my blood to hear it.    I can't provide individual examples, but whenever I hear of a soldier using his body to cover a grenade and save his battles it really strikes a cord with me. It's such a selfless act, and I'm sure it's saved countless other soldiers from losing limbs or dying.    Basic training in Fort Benning, Georgia. I definitely matured a lot that summer, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't suck a good amount.    As someone that grew up not knowing my dad or living with my mom, I really never gave him much thought at all. When I was in 9th grade he sent me a message via Facebook saying who he was. We sent maybe 6 messages each back and forth before I just stopped answering. It's not that he was an asshole or a bad guy, I mean he was an army engineer, and has a whole family now. I think knowing that he does have a whole family is the worst though, because be raised two daughters into their teens before ever even making any sort of contact with me. Now that said, I don't harbor any hatred for him, nor do I wish he was ever a part of my life. My life has been weird and unorthodox, but I've come to accept that and love all of the people that make it what it is.    Well of course if lemon juice, then you have to take into consideration the motivation behind it. Usually when lemon juice, it's a selfish act. Entirely lacks compassion or care for others. However, there are rare cases when lemon juice for reasons that nobody else can understand. You really have to look into the root of the issue to understand why lemon juice, and stop being so judgemental, because when push comes to shove you just might have to lemon juice too.    Bathrooms across the country are mine for the taking    Lives several states away with his family...   Funny you should say that about dxm. The first few times I did it people would say my name and I would just be like what? What the hell is that word? And I'd just repeat it over and over trying to figure it out. Fun times.    Every  time I've taken percs it made me insanely social and euphoric. I would talk faster than ever on them. Fun stuff.    I don't understand it either. I had a friend who puked every time he took gels, and would take them like 5 at a time. Personally, I just twist the lid off, rip the paper, dump all twenty of those suckers in my hand, and pour em in my mouth. Combine that with any liquid, water or tea or whatever, and swallow. Never had a problem, and they always go down easy. I don't even notice the taste. I guess if you don't like something of that size sliding down your food tube then just take like ten at a time.    If you're looking for something mild like bud, kratom is probably your best bet. If you're looking to get fucked up, probably most psychedelics or dxm. I enjoy dxm, but it's the kind of drug that you'll probably want to do alone and when you have a good 8 hours to be alone. Also not the best thing to be taking daily. So I'd say kratom for taking the edge off.    I found it right in the grass bordering the woods and there weren't any others near it. I'd say the stem was about as big as the palm of my hand, maybe a bit bigger and about as thick as a finger. I'll see if it's where I left it and take a picture with something to scale it.   Thanks for the help though, I've been looking online for a while now and haven't come up with anything.   Also, I looked up the megacollybia rodmani and it looks like that's it.   Edit: wow I was dead wrong on the size, I'll upload a better picture in a minute. I'm thinking you were definitely correct now.   Edit edit: http://imgur.com/a/MLneN        	24
 We moved to Japan and he became extremely matted during the transport.   House wife for now. Haha! I will get a job here in a few months after we are all settled.   Ommigosh!!! This is the cutest thing!!!  I love it!!!   She's gorgeous!!!   My other cat has been hissing at him too... I feel so bad for him. He has no idea why.   :)   My husband is.   Yes! We were able to quarantine him before we moved in home for 180 days.   I had to guarantee no interaction with other animals. Being indoor only, that wasn't a problem.   Haha! Awesome!   It's is fairly expensive and there is a lot that must be done before Japan will allow them into the country. There's also a 180 day quarantine period which can be done before you import them. I brought 2 cats and cost around $700. Some people go into the thousands depending on how they are transporting them and what vet they go to.   We had to have 2 rabies vaccinations done 30 days apart and then a FAVN blood test. His quarantine started from the day the blood test was done and can be started 180 days before entering the country. We then had to get approval from the Japanese government. He was checked by a quarantine official immediately upon entering the country and before going through customs. It is a very difficult and expensive process. We actually brought 2 cats with us.   Oklahoma.   We relocated because of my husband's job.   I moved to Okinawa, Japan last week... It's mid 60's-70's here and he's indoor only. His fur became extremely matted during transport. I would not have shaved him unless it was necessary.   Here is a before pic... http://i.imgur.com/qRXHyjV.jpg   Here you go... http://i.imgur.com/qRXHyjV.jpg and http://i.imgur.com/w7Fhtg4.jpg   Several people already have... I can't wait to see how it turns out!!   He really likes to take showers... He used to jump in every morning with my son and I had to occasionally cut mats out, this was really bad though.   It's perfect! Thank you!!!   It's his fuhpa...   I had to check him. He is (was) 15lbs and his carrier was too large for in cabin. He seemed to do pretty well considering, other than the matting.    I took him to a groomer. He is very calm and docile.    We just moved to Okinawa, Japan... It's in the mid 60's-70's here. He's also indoor only.   Sure! http://i.imgur.com/mbOm27m.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/McYq0s3.jpg  	25

I know this comment is going to be downvoted to oblivion by the Israel brigadel, but it's as if the Israelis learned population control from Nazi Germany.

Eat with its pecker.                              This was my go to issue. Americans have been scared of socialism since the turn of the 20th century. In fact, any economic ideology that competes with capitalism will be a hard fought battle for any generation. It's the perfect example of entire portions of the population fighting against there own best interests. When taxes are proposed on the wealthy or corporations, the US elites political watch dogs begin screaming that it's a scheme to transfer wealth between social groups and a form of class warfare. Meanwhile, smirking in the background are wealthy individuals, sipping on a nice single-malt scotch, and thinking to themselves what a bunch of ignorant putzes populate the rest of the nation.                           "You still only get fifteen minutes, and you're paying full price."                                 It's an originalist argument because they used the "clear and present danger" argument.         Actually the justices used the "clear and present danger" excuse to place Japanese Americans in prison camps. That is an originalist argument. If you'd like more information I'm placing a reading list below.      Peter H. Irons. A Peoples History of the Supreme Court. New York: Viking, 1999.      Cliff Sloan, and David McKean.

There are plenty of reasons to decry an originalist SCOTUS because the constitution was written for a different country. There was no capitalism or corporations for the original framers to protect against. There were African Americans but how did that go for them? Relying on an origanalist's interpretation of the constitution kept them from freely using their voting rights until 1965. It allowed the military to place Japanese in camps during WWII.      Weird sex parties that include masks and tons of flabby bellies hiding wrinkly droopy ball sacks.   Republicans want to control the judiciary appointments because it provides the opportunity to enact laws friendly to the party and the financial system that supports the party. Giving corporate-person hood a free-speech argument wouldn't have occurred without the maneuvering of George Bush cronies.    There's another article trending in r/politics about judicial vacancies that have been held up for an extremely long time. One of the means to protect business-friendly laws and those who would break them is to control the laws and those who decide the law's legality. By keeping judicial seats vacant or by changing the rules to remove a progressive judge, conservatives control the ideology that bends justice towards those that least deserve it.                                                                                                   sorry...that was supposed to go into r/news.                                                               The funny thing is that McConnell is married to a chinese woman, which was taboo in US society only a century earlier. If the nation allowed prejudices in any form, McConnell would still be single and without his daddy-in-law's money.   The difference between Cali's drought and the snowy east coast is that the latter is a singular event that occurred this year while the former is a long-term ongoing event.   jesus was married to mary magdalene, even though it's not mentioned in the bible.      reasoning: when the romans crucified someone, they did it by the book. this was especially true with jesus because his crucifixion was political in nature. one of the romans strictest rules was that only family could visit or collect the body after death. mm's inclusion into the viewing party at the tomb means she must have been married to jesus or the romans wouldn't have let her anywhere near him.

Cut your squash in half length-wise. Scoop out and discard the seeds. Place both halves on a tray and bake for 30 minutes at 400. Remove from the oven and let it cool a bit so you can handle it. Then scoop out the squash and discard the skin/rind. Put the squash in a blender/food processor until it is creamy. Once you have the puree, add a cup of ricotta to it along with the milk, half a teaspoon of salt, and nutmeg. Blend it up. Put the mixture into a bowl and set aside.  In a pan, saute the garlic and cook down your spinach until it is wilty. Remove from heat and combine with the rest of the ricotta and a cup of mozzarella. Set aside.  Now youll need to cook the lasagna noodles. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add your noodles, add some salt, and cook until soft (but not mushy or easily broken). Drain the water and set the noodles aside.   In a baking or casserole dish, spread out a layer of the butternut squash mixture. Then place some of the lasagna noodles over it. Atop the noodles spread the spinach mixture. The next layer of noodles, then squash mixture, then spinach. Repeat until you have the layers that you prefer. I love cheese so over each spinach layer I added more of the remaining cheese but make sure you have enough cheese left over to coat the top. With your oven set to 375, bake the dish for 30 minutes or until the top layer is nicely brown.

I prefer to cook squashes in my microwave but traditionally theyre baked in an oven. So, I stab holes all around the squash and put into the microwave for 10 minutes on high. I pull it out, check to see if its soft enough (its damn hot so be careful), and usually put it in for another 10 minutes. Once out, I cut it in half. I let it cool for a couple of minutes so that I can handle it but gutting the squash is best done while its warm. With a fork, you scratch out the meat of the squash. This is where itll become clear how it got its name.  Evenly spread about half of the squash out on the bottom of your casserole or baking dish. Then place half of your tomato slices over it. You should mix all the spices together and sprinkle half of it over the tomatoes. I love cheese, so I sprinkle it over the tomatoes as well. Spread the rest of squash atop that, then the rest of the tomatoes, sprinkle the remaining spices, then the remaining cheese. I like to add a little extra basil and parsley on top of the cheese. Put the dish uncovered in the oven at 350 and bake for about 30 minutes or until the cheese is well melted.   Spaghetti Squash Carbonara Ingredients:  * one spaghetti squash * 6 slices of bacon cut into strips or squares * cup of chicken broth * 1.5 cup of shredded parmesan cheese * 2 eggs * 2 cloves of minced garlic * teaspoons salt   Directions: Cook the squash, shred it with a fork, and put it in a bowl and set it in the refrigerator. In a saucepan, fry the bacon. Before it gets crispy, throw in the garlic. Once your bacon is cooked to your liking, add the chicken broth. Stir the broth and let it cook until about half of it has boiled off. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, cheese, and salt. Add to the saucepan and mix well.

Finely chop onion and add with chopped bell peppers and garlic once the pan is hot. Saute until fragrant and soft (at least 15 minutes). Add spices (cumin, paprika and cayenne) and stir well for about a minute. Pour in tomatoes adding salt and pepper to taste. Stir the whole thing letting it simmer for at least 10 minutes. The mixture should thicken slightly and once it does add feta. Once youve mixed the feta in, create a few pockets where you can crack the eggs into. With the eggs cooking, I like to reduce the heat a bit and cover the pan so that they poach, which takes about 10 minutes.   [Shakshuka with feta](https://train_subject1405.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/foodiesphere-one-pan-shakshuka-with-feta/)  Ingredients-- Olive oil; Onion; 2 red bell peppers; 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced; 1 teaspoon cumin (I was more liberal with my cumin   paprika, but at least a teaspoon each); 1 teaspoon paprika; 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper; 2 cans (14.5 oz.) diced tomatoes; 1 teaspoon salt; 1 teaspoon black pepper; 12 ounces feta cheese crumbles; 6-7 eggs   Directions Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Finely chop onion and add with chopped bell peppers and garlic once the pan is hot. Saute until fragrant and soft (at least 15 minutes). Add spices (cumin, paprika and cayenne) and stir well for about a minute. Pour in tomatoes adding salt and pepper to taste. Stir the whole thing letting it simmer for at least 10 minutes.

 Good on you for editing the wiki! I always get so happy when I see people doing things like that. I would love to hear an episode of the podcast where they go through the wiki correcting things.    Yes! Back then the character would just have one little thing prepared and everything else was a new slate. Like Ice-T and his inventions.   -s-s-s-s-s.  I got you OP.   My favourite Reggie moment is when Scott does the beginning "thanks for playing the song, bye Reggie" thing and then a few minutes later he actually comes on mic and asks can he stay for the show.  I was binge listening and didn't see the guest list so it was a total surprise.   I don't know what Avenue Q is but I was talking about the custom puppets you see advertised online.   I loved that show so much. I also love the live action Muppet Babies in The Muppets Take Manhattan.    I don't believe they're available for sale anywhere and it wouldn't really be worthwhile. They'd be about 100 dollars each to buy but only 20 dollars or so to make.   Edit: Eh...sorry for answering your question? If you need help making them I can give you a hand I've made quite a few puppets but none of the quality of those in the show.       Why do you guys not like Jim Gaffigan, I've only really heard of him.   The one where he talks about, I think it's a Woody Allen movie, is my favourite of his appearances.    He seemed similar at the entourageathon, I think he's just more comfortable when he's hosting his own stuff.    Luckily this episode was only based over two nights.    Yep it's a fake stomach.    I actually disliked that shot because I found it sort of unrealistic that all of the photos were recent of all kids. The photos in my home and other homes I know of normally have a mix of old and new.    That book to me is by far the stupidest part of the whole series. It makes absolutely no sense.   Yeah that's why I feel like I relate more to Z than Y. I feel like my life was more like the lives of late Z's than early Y's.   Edit: I changed Y for X.    Ooh yeah I should explain. Generation Y is considered the people born between the 80's and early 90's/early 2000's based on who you ask. And Generation Z is people born between mid 90's/early 2000's and late 00's based on who you ask.    I'm very interested in the whole generation name things. And most of the people on this sub could be in either depending on who you ask. Except some of the younger ones are pretty much definitely Generation Z.   Nope it's satire but you shouldn't let that affect your enjoyment.    Well the project it's from is very much someone trying to do Tim and Eric. http://youtu.be/75z7BM5FsNY It's not nearly absurd enough for my taste though.    Anyone have a link to the song?   Like today :(   News stories?   I wish there was a solution as easy as that.   That could be a bot though.   What sort of things? Can you give me an example of something that has already happened today I could predict?   I'm just checking so I can get help if it happens again tomorrow.      Well yeah if you couldn't get through Pride and Prejudice you shouldn't be able to get through Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. The whole point is that it is as similar to the original as possible but eith zombies. If this film will follow suit I imagine it to have similar soundtrack, direction and cinematography of a normal period drama but with the zombie plot added in.   There is currently /r/blackout2015      I've had trouble with this too recently. It seems a bunch of the old ones were with playmo.tv and they've stopped doing it. I'll have to try out ones linked in the comments here.   Are the best scenes yet to come?   I have a feeling a lot of visual stuff was going on. Expecially that second scene with the teacher and the students. The audience were laughing at moments of pure silence for us.      I guess so but it technically isn't really related. Schrodinger's Cat isn't really about timelines. They just fit it in.   The new Rick and Morty got it right, didn't it? They were just a bunch of flying cats.   But which on are the mods going to go with? The guy who wants to ban you for using it or you????? Ehhhh.... should I say it or not...  What about a word like it....   like....  RAVIOLI RAVIOLI      I'd say they would be more similar than just animated actually. Both of them revolve around a family dynamic mixing with high concept sci-fi. Infact the character dynamic feels similar in the pilot with Jerry trying to "bust" Rick similar to Candace.    You could donate to Harmontown.   I fucked my dog since there is no laws during the leap second.   The UK Apprentice. It feels very classy for a reality show and I think the fact it's on the BBC helps. There is only "last times" and "next times" at the start and end of each show rather than between commercials since there aren't any commercials. Also while the show does focus on the drama between contestants it doesn't do it as blatantly as other shows.   Well this is a kids tv show so I'd say this doesn't represent him.   I have a feeling Community will be blamed.   Good job! I wanted the one holding the puppet to be on the right in both.   In all Pixar movies or all the toy story movies?  	47
 Is that modded in? I don't remember that line.   Any chance of one specific to the American South?   Without Kojima around, I doubt Konami will be able to make another proper Metal Gear.   I thought for sure Bayonetta 1 and 2 were making them some money.   So is there a meet up happening today? If so, where and when?   Something something neurodiversity! /s      Thank you. Thank you so much.   Neither do the Germans. Hell, these days I'd back the Polish army over theirs.   I now really want to see art of Spongebob Hankhill. Or Hankbob Squarehill. Whatever.   Sounds like an excuse for more totalitarian "security" measures, if you ask me.   That sure would be neat.   It would also explain why they have it in their heads to dip people and seem to be able to throw together a semi-organized raiding party despite having the IQ of a damp sandwich. It's all half remembered orders from the smarties.   Literally everybody on air is asleep. People in the background? Head desk. Anchors? Slumped. Morning show hosts? Couch nappin'. Even the announcers are replaced with snores.   Maybe there was a schism in the mutie ranks at some point. I mean, Vault 87 looks to have been the scene of a fair deal of fighting and FEV is spewed about all over the place. Maybe some smarter muties arose and used centaurs to ferry some quantity of FEV out into the world.    NEED. MORE. GREEN STUFF!   You've got some pretty good LPs, there. Subbed and liking.   Looking at their complexion, I'd imagine we're going to be dealing Vault 87 mutants again. Wonder what brought them out to Boston? Has DC been utterly depopulated? It seemed to be on the mend when we left it.   I'm glad you enjoyed it! I really wonder how they're going to fit into the story.   The only real explanation I've seen on here. Well done.   And how exactly is Moscow telling Kishinev what to do? You seem to be of the opinion that it should federate, which the vastly weakened Russian caucus would be against. I doubt, however, that a decision made in Moscow would have any bearing on letting Transnistria go entirely.    If I had bought and paid for the building, sure. However, this isn't a fair comparison. It sounds to me sort of like the "stranger in the house" argument in American politics regarding illegal immigration. You can't reduce demographic and independence problems down to an individual level like that and expect it to hold the same meaning.   No, no. I was never talking about reintegrating Transnistria. I think Kishinev should let it be independent.    Sure, much like the DPR and LPR. But I thought the Alliance for Euro Integration was pretty huge in Moldova right now and the Russian lobby was failing.   Sure, but Moscow isn't calling the shots in Tiraspol directly. Besides, Kishinev could just renounce its claim to Transnistria and pursue membership in NATO and the EU without issue since its territory would be uncontested then.   I don't get it. If Transnistria has been so adamant about wanting to leave Moldova that they've been running themselves since the Soviet Union fell, why doesn't Kishinev just let them leave? There comes a time when trying to reclaim secessionist regions becomes pig headed and pointless.   Celebrity deaths rarely affect me, but I'll make an exception this time. Guy was an absolutely amazing person.   Sfine. I appreciate the sentiment all the same.   They can, they'd just look like giant hypocrites if they did. OH WAIT   Tons of people are doing just that. Voat, among others, will grow larger. By alienating its subscriber base, reddit is really shooting itself in the foot.   Default mod, here. Do you intend on banning SRS, /u/ekjp?   And as usual, you won't see the admins say shit about banning SRS.    Perhaps even he, with his vast wealth, lacked the ability to protect the entirety of the US. Perhaps he knew that tipping his hand would cause a run on Vegas. Perhaps he could only save Vegas and was forced to let the rest of the nation burn. This is all speculation, however.   The House always wins.   Where we're going, we won't need blogs to spout inane opinions.   I don't know, I've been to Berkeley. Plenty of homeless in the Bay.   "Oh death... Oh deeeaaath! Won't you spare me over til another day?"   And now you shall notice it everywhere.   Good idea. Will do!   This firearm is very special to me, and I thought I'd share it with the world. It's not the rarest weapon around, but I love it dearly.   /r/keming    Isn't it, though?   Where do Chaos Space Marines come from? Today on Dirty Jobs, we're going to find out! Join us as we venture to Khalan-Gol, to the pit of the [Daemonculabae!](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Daemonculaba)   Aren't all of the fossil fuels supposed to be gone by then, anyway?   We probably would have seen Ernst Tallmann being more successful with the German Communists. The 30s and 40s would then have seen a German-Soviet alliance that would have been quite interesting to observe.   Good on you.   See to it that it's never repaired. Things like that tell a story, and history should always be preserved.   I had just poured some coffee there and it dried. Proooooobably should have wiped it down, actually.   Here you go  https://youtu.be/DOGhCwSlx10   Oh wow, the man himself watched my video. My local discount shop has tons more stuff like this. I'll have to send some of it along.   Many piles of thanks!   Not a bad choice, and Sig do have a US based subsidiary, which is requisite for defense contracts IIRC.   I'd love to see that, especially given how fun they were in New Vegas, but somehow I don't see Bethesda doing that. Maybe they'd come up with a stealth variant of Vault 87 mutants, but given Bethsoft's reticence to delve too deep into Interplay/Black Isle's lore...   My money is on Vault 87 muties. Bethesda seems to stick to their own lore and I don't see them coming up with a new origin for mutants unless it's a huge part of the story - something that would feature in the trailer. That's my two cents, anyway.   How is nobody talking about the fact that screenshot five is obviously about supermutants?   I'd scrap the M9 entirely, to be honest. A polymer framed, striker fired .45 would be the best bet. Probably a 9mm due to NATO requirements. Give it to Glock USA or maybe Smith and Wesson. Maybe.    That seems to be the consensus. The disagreement is which bloated contractor should the Pentagon pick to produce the gas piston M4 successor.    Guy has an American flag, comrade. He believes he can any honor he wants.    Foreign number three!   Battlestar Galactica   Sounds good to me, then.   That's near the table top game store, isn't it? I'd be on board for that.   Sheesh. More like /r/shittyvexillology. This is Liberia tier.    Beautiful. An artistic tour de force.   I never found the concept of race based privilege to make complete sense. If being white gives you all of these advantages, why is rural Appalachia still so poorly off? Why are whites so often passed over for promotions in the world of business?    I'm something of a gun guy, and I find it incredible that we spend so much money on these competitions just to eventually settle up on basically unchanged M16 family rifles. Oh, and don't even get me started on how much of a clusterfuck the M9 replacement is being.   We could have sent every college student since '96 to school with that money, I'd bet.   Hey, I'm glad you enjoyed it. Fantastic firearm, isn't it? I can't imagine anything I'd love to carry more than mine.    Seems rather demoralizing to actually list trains as destroyed, don't you think?   It's certainly good enough for here. Fine rifle, even if black plastic on a slav gun isn't how I'd do things.   Just like how they ground up, distilled, and drank Boris Yeltsin.    Thanks! I'm really glad you liked it.    I consider myself an amateur with this stuff, so I can't speak to it as well as I'd like; but I'd consider acid weed's stronger older brother with more world experience and also he's probably been to other countries or something. As introspective and thought provoking as weed can be, it's also much more mellow (in my experience) and less powerful than acid. You can function, to an extent, after a joint. Acid, meanwhile, sort of forces you to sit back and observe and think. It's very powerful that way. You're really forced to take note of the trip and experience everything that's going on. It's definitely not to be taken lightly, but it's much more "magical."   It really forces you to appreciate what a powerful and profound force neurochemistry is. Not a lot of people fully appreciate that, seeing as how very few people read about it and consider the various chemical compounds swirling around in our skulls. On a deeper level, it makes you consider the very essence of consciousness - that such a small dosage of a tasteless, odorless chemical can so drastically alter your perception. Years on, I still find myself returning to that first trip and considering it. It's something I'd recommend everybody (barring certain people with genetic histories of mental illness or of weak constitution) experience if for nothing else than the shift of perception it gives you.    Did you see that huge flying city at the American pavilion? Columbia, I think it was called. Pretty neat. Shame we don't know what happened to it.   The first time I ever tried acid was on a fluke. A friend of a friend had some and we found ourselves each with a hit of it. Nothing seemed to happen for the longest time after I put it in my mouth. I thought I'd been duped. But then, slowly, a sort of creeping magic overtook the surface of everything I looked at. Time and proportion seemed to fall away, or at least become less important. Insight and inspiration were behind every dust mote, and everything seemed to be either profound or hilarious. It was a wonderful experience and I consider myself fortunate to have had it.  EDIT: If you're going to try acid for the first time, the environment you're in and the people you're with are key to having a good trip. I was with my girlfriend (who I love dearly) in a clean room with Futurama on the TV. This is just about as good a setup as you can get. In retrospect, I'd have put some more interesting patterns on the wall to enjoy or some more fresh fruit on hand (it makes fruit taste AMAZING) but the point here is that [set and setting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) are absolutely key here.   I think when they readopted the Byelorussian SSR's flag, they went back and changed the meaning of it so they could keep the Soviet nostalgia of it without actually being, erm, Soviet.   It lacks the same impact. When I hold a letter, I think of the time someone sent writing it, mailing it, and waiting for a reply. That, to me, makes the message received much more meaningful than just a text message saying "yo ur fukkin opinion is rong" or something.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum   Well, when something is apolitical, you can use whatever aesthetic you please. As I'm still not really convinced that using the article is all that terrible, I think I'm going to continue to do it. I've not seen it reliably demonstrated that there's any reason to be offended by it other than insecurity.    I've studied a bit of Russian and a smattering of Ukrainian, but doesn't the Russian name of the Ukraine translate to the borderlands while the Ukrainian name translates to the land/country/nation? The on/in question is a wholly different matter, but it seems like people pushing for the English language to drop the article seem to be saying that we should think of their name as a Russian word rather than a Ukrainian word.   I still just don't see it as being tied to the notion of a "Russian world" or other forms of revanchism. It's old fashioned, sure, but it also works much better aesthetically.    See, people act like I'm insane when I say I love the South and Southern culture. I really do. Southerners are inventive, warm people who have genuinely done quite a lot of clever innovation and have contributed a lot to the United States and the world as a whole. The South deserves better than the wave of religiosity and the perception of bigotry it's saddled with.    How do you figure? What logic lead you to that assumption?   After all, the Netherlands just means "the lowlands." Similarly, the Ukraine means "the borderlands." Nobody is disputing either of these countries and wanting to be rid of the article smacks more of sad insecurity than any sort of pride or anything.   It would if they identified as Mexican and the land they lived on had been in their family for quite some time. We need to look at what people want, not what central governments want.   Because Putin is literally Hitler, right?  Anyway, plenty of polls were done before the reacession of Crimea which backed up that popular Crimean opinion leaned towards Russia.    Aren't de facto maps used in many contexts anyway? You know, the ones where a productive use is relying on those maps? They're more utilitarian, so I say why not?   conquering  You don't seem to be fimiliar with the history of the region. Most of the people there are ethnically Russian, everybody speaks Russian, and nobody there likes Kiev. It was only ever made Ukrainian for the administrative convenience of the GOSPLAN of the Central Soviet. Since there is no Central Soviet anymore, there's no reason for it to belong to the Ukraine. As a Ukrainian Crimea makes little sense and people living on Crimea are Russian, to call Crimea conquered is pandering to Kiev's perspective.   The Crimea is a part of Russia, though. It's high time we started updating maps to coincide with reality.    No more than "the" Philippines is offense, or "the" Netherlands. How about "the" United States? "El" Salvador? The the is fine.   EDIT: Randumtoon has edited his comment. It originally just said that "The Ukraine is offensive."   The Ukraine works just fine, is etymologically more correct, and really sounds better. The article was only dropped to apppease insecure nationalists who somehow thought the article was harming their national image. Insecure.   Now, one thing you seem to be forgetting is that political maps are already rife with bias. Taiwan, for example, is nearly always shown in a different color than mainland China in the West's maps. This occurs despite the fact that under international law, there is only one China. In addition, the status of Kashmir tends to be up to whoever is printing the map that day and many maps are already showing the disputed nation of Kosovo.  Put simply, political maps are all about perspective, and de facto maps are better.   Edit: Besides, if it's all about Russian perspectives, where's Transnistria?   American attitudes are changing about a lot of things. Given time, I think prejudice against Muslims will abate.    You're absolutely right. Why it isn't reflected in more maps is beyond me.   The news makes a big stink about Islam and I'm not particularly keen on a lot of the canon in Islam (or Christianity, for that matter), but I have to say that every Muslim I've ever met has been extremely kind and they seem to take the good elements of the faith (charity, mercy, compassion) to heart. America could use more citizens like the Muslims we've got. I'm just sorry this sentiment isn't more common.    Crimea to Russia  Surprised you didn't get more shit about that. People get really touchy about that wherever I go.   The Ukraine is never getting it back. To think otherwise is delusional.   Boxcar, maybe? New Haven Pizza? A sketchy alley?   [Here you go.](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong#Pre-invasion)  And [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4sxWJISt_8) it is in game.   I'd love to go to one. Could we pick a wheelchair friendly venue? I don't want people busting their asses lifting me up steps, but I'd still very much enjoy attending.   Decades? Canderous Freakin' Ordo of the Mandalorian Supercommandos saw an advance scout - though unidentified as such - thousands of years before the main armada arrived.   Maybe? But unless OP is the guy who colorized it, it seems like it wouldn't be a problem to nip it off in paint or something. It detracts from the picture as a whole aesthetically and really cheapens it.  EDIT: Just noticed OP's name. D'oh. Nevermind.   Would have been better without the enormous banner ad.   Aren't we already?   No need for the quotation brackets, those women did quite a lot. As for Tubman, she did a huge deal as well but it was all sort of to do with abolitionism, not really nation building. I thought that's what people got on currency for.   Not to sell her short, as she did a LOT for her causes, but I don't see her being as influential as Sakagawea.    She's an even better choice. We'd also have somebody involved in computing, that way, and it's possibly one of the most important innovations in civilized history. Great choice.   Ol' Honest Abe's already on two articles of currency, as is George Washington. Besides, nobody really uses the Sakagawea coin (even though there are scads of reasons why they should). Let's give her something that people actually bother with, like the $20.   I think this was an XKCD comic.   I'm not saying that Harriet Tubman wasn't prominent or notable or anything, but compared to all of that... Maybe we should pick a woman who accomplished more to be on the $20 if we're going to be replacing Andrew Jackson.  Maybe Eleanor Roosevelt? Sakagawea? General Margaret A. Brewer?   Welp. There goes my good mood. I think I'm going to tell my girlfriend how much I appreciate her today.   Ah hell, might as well get in on this. Congrats, OP.   OP poked a hole in an aloe plant and threaded a grass blade through it.   I searched and there doesn't seem to be such a thing. Odd.    I'd say I'm mediocre at best, but thanks for keeping the dream alive.   [Done](http://www.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome/comments/37myiw/the_new_relationship_between_workers_and/)      Well, this is still sadly relevant.   So basically everyone in the show is hitched to each other. Gotcha.   American, here. I've never met an Iranian who wasn't an immensely friendly person. Yours is a rich, beautiful culture with a lot to offer the world and your architecture is awe inspiring. If we could make nice with just one country on our current blacklist, Iran would be the one I'd pick.   Georgia, here. Can confirm. Back when I lived there, if you asked for a coke (or cocola) in some more rural places, they'd ask what kind of coke you wanted. Dr Pepper and Sprite were acceptable answers to this question.   This. Speaking as someone who tumblrinas might not consider privileged, the only privilege that matters is wealth. One could argue that all forms of discrimination stem from class differences. If you've got money, you've won. End of story.   It's like that rubbish flag of Earth if the Communists had won.   We were pretty damned close during the Korean War. Any of a number of things could have happened that would have allowed MacArthur to exercise his ultimate goal: glassing China. The Soviets, still not having split with their Chinese friends over destalinization, would have responded, deploying nuclear weapons on UN forces in Korea and possibly Japan. What happens from here is a little harder to call. Would the European theater have gone hot? Would nuclear responses against the United States and the Soviet Union happen? Would the conflict have somehow fail to escalate further due to reasons? Who can say.   Upvoting because I'd love to get some of those soundtracks.   De jure legality has nothing to do with what happens de facto.   If something is wrong with you and you happened to enjoy that, you can watch me review a fake poop machine [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZBn0dhxkIg)   George would then heroically sacrifice himself by casting his corrupted form into the swirling maw of the Reflecting Pool. Lincoln, battle scarred and embittered, would ascend the Golden Throne of the God Presidency of These United States to reign triumphant in honor and glory for a thousand years of American peace and prosperity.   Meanwhile, in the twisted, corrupted outlands known as London, the corrupted form of Washington awakens; having been cast thither into the defiled and despoiled city by the tempestuous holy waters of the Mall. He has but one goal - the destruction of his former friend who did nothing while he was overrun by the creeping powers corruption. He rallies the mutant British to his cause, claiming for himself a new moniker...  King George.   There really ought to be a special subreddit for trashy pregnant people. It's a special level of trashy that just seems to go above and beyond.   [I had a go at narrating this.](http://vocaroo.com/i/s1Exd0PbvnAR) Hope you don't mind. As a wannabe narrator, practice is invaluable.   This is my sentiment. Better to be Firefly than the Simpsons, no?   calling the separatists terrorists  Stopped reading right about there.   There all is aching.   I'll have to see how much international postage is. If it's reasonable, I might send him a whole bunch of crap I've found in shops here.   Thank you! I actually have several videos of bizarre tatty products I've found in shops on my channel, if anybody wants to see them as well. I'm glad you enjoyed my video! I'll be sure to keep looking for crap to put in front of my webcam.   I'm not sure if it's allowed for me to post this here. If not, I'll remove it.   Reviewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOGhCwSlx10), along with some other crap I found at the local off brand discount store.   I'll post a video here. It doesn't look like they are, but based on the build quality of the things, I really wouldn't be surprised if they were.   Even better! They have internet.org!    best and most prestigious medical institutes in India and by consequence, the world.  Uh huh. If you want to believe that, that's your business.    I wonder when someone will update Irrational's wikipedia page. It's obviously not a dead company.   I may open them up on YouTube for all to see and appreciate. They look fantastically awful.   You should be careful. Fox's copyright gestapo has been particularly vicious since they started licensing these hats.   Incidentally, you can make any semi loading weapon emulate automatic fire with next to no effort if you're willing to pay for the ammo. Look up bump firing. It's neat.   Maybe some mutants on a treadmill.      Sure. Just look at the huge amounts of output in Western animation ever since Flash became accepted. You have work that is in quite a few cases nearly indistinguishable from hand drawn being put out with a far lower expenditure of time, effort, and material at a much lower cost. Anime has been slow to adapt to these advances, but I think that as Japan as a whole is being forced to move away from older modes of thinking and acting, the traditional reticence that pervades many industries (including anime) will fall away by necessity and anime will adopt these new methods of production.   Likewise.   Sadly, child porn is quite a bit easier to make than a mil-spec fragmentation grenade. Something being illegal has no bearing on how easy it is to get. This is why gangs in countries with tight gun control can still get by with pissant little zip guns but can't break out any heavy machine guns.   No worries. Looking at my wording, what you said was a totally understandable reading of my comment. Few things piss me off more than know it alls, so I'd likely have posted the same thing as you if I had been in a certain sort of mood.   Lightning links are a thing for ARs, Drop In Auto Sears apparently exist for AKs. As neither of these are true automatic fire, however, and I would be curious to see the reliability of emulating sustained automatic fire in a civilian legal military pattern rifle.   I'm not assuming that it's impossible, just unlikely.    That's not as difficult. With enough time and patience, anybody with a lathe and a press can churn out a homemade Sten. Making a military hand grenade that looks just like the real thing may be more difficult.  It looks like it's an M67. Perhaps it came from a South American country and was smuggled up? It's relatively small and border control tends to look for firearms over explosives, so it's not inconceivable that it ended up here. I'm not sure if any South American countries use the M67, though.    It had to have been a dummy. Assuming this is in North America or Western Europe, where does one even *get* an active hand grenade?   They've got some really keen up and comers getting into the industry now. If they can solve the stagnation in storylines and a few other issues - for example, the universally awful working conditions - then I have every faith that the rising crop of anime directors and writers can keep the industry vibrant and relevant for years to come.   Also, didn't Hiyao Miyazaki predict that the anime industry had two years left in it back in 2010?    Fascism is only fascism when it's against their opinion. Didn't you get the memo?  	153
 She is leafing you?   Damn...that's harsh.   Sorry dude.   It's pretty much up to you.   Sounds like you did your due diligence and you are off the hook.  Only other advice I could give is, if it's an older tube style TV, they didn't take to temperature changes well. (Sometimes) So if you left them sit to come around to room temperature they would often start working normally again.   It's my 2c, good luck!    Everyone has to start somewhere. You are on the right road.    Funny, I feel like I have just had this conversation a couple days ago...   I have book one in my TBR pile as we speak. Really looking forward to it.   So many good books and so little time.  Perhaps one day I will be one of the greats too :)  Or just happy with my own work...either would do.   Brandon Sanderson. You can't go wrong with his works.  If you want to try an indie, look up The Event, by J. Heppner.    People have started to steal my books and load them on torrent and epub sites for free...  :(   Now the fun of trying to get them taken down begins, and so this creates even less time for writing.    It's a pretty well known fact that almost all authors don't read their own work. Even Stephan King went on record saying that he want's to edit/revise his work all the time.    Successful by whose standards? The same people that made the system?   OMG! We are all going to be dead!  (Already)   Congrats! Best thing you can do now?   Put it away for 6 weeks or more. 6 Months would be better. Don't even look at it again. Just go write another one.   When the time has passed, look at it with eyes that will be fresh and see the errors of your ways.   You won't regret it. I promise.   Three! Have another four on the burners at all time.    Other than the shocked look, this is pretty much what I was thinking! Thanks!   I would like to see a man looking up at a ruined sky scraper-tower, with a German Shepard at his side. In a post apocalyptic world.    Oh man! ICQ! I forgot I had one of those, just logged into and BOOM! One of my old friends still uses it. That is so awesome!     Just before I got this letter I yet again had my books bought and then returned. (Pirated) People do this to me all the time and Amazon expects me to help them with something?  Hell No.  How about this...let me actually control MY OWN PRICES! Let me sell a book for .25 and make .24 in profit. Instead of 2.99 and getting .72c of it.   You are forcing us to make our books stupidly expensive just to make a buck.  Give us authors a chance to control our work and maybe we will be more willing to help fight one of your battles.   A sprinkler....I WILL RAIN DOWN TERROR!   And you can sell the wheel barrow for at least twenty bucks! You're ahead!   I'm sure she has a big heart though.    Listen.  Look her (or him) in the eyes when you talk.  Turn off your phone.  Turn off the T.V.  Hold hands.  Go outside.  Talk to each other and don't be afraid.    Thousands of others....thousands.   If you can snatch the pebble from my hand grasshopper...   Thank you very much! New chapter here I come.    Would love to step up and do what I would like for the next 20 years, but sadly, that won't pay the bills.    Sales. I was good at it, always came in with great standings. Customers liked me, just under appreciated.    And it feels great.  They cared so little about me that they didn't even bother to say a word about it. I will miss it in some ways, but in many others it can just go get bent.  Here's to a new horizon and a new future. I will write my own destiny!    I know! It's the N on that part number. Who uses a reman Bosch when you can get a new at the same price...(and better warranty)   Go away, or I shall taunt you a second time!   Email the company and they will tell you local suppliers or if you are lucky, send you samples.   OP and everyone else who has a tough time reading. Send me a PM with your email address and I will send you a copy of my latest book n/c. It's a light read, fast paced, and only about 4 hours to finish.  I can't make your desire to read become strong again, but perhaps I can give you something to start you on the path.   I'm...BATICE!   No...that's not right, I need to just...chill...    When it comes to your power supply, you can't go wrong with a bigger one.   If you want to add something later, best to have the extra power now instead of having to just upgrade it later on.   *Deleted   Would you need more? Or less?   Now that is the question.  If you have no need for $500 most will assume you are rich already. Or, you are so far in debt, that $500 isn't splash in the pan.    There are tons more to go though. His writing is a style all of it's own.   How about a guy reaching through a mirror as if the surface was just like the top of a calm lake...   If it can grow lettuce, it can grow...   Carrots!   Not the one I was thinking of, but looks interesting enough to check out on its own. Thank you.   Ahh! You nailed it! It was the mountain that was throwing me off. Thank you!    It was a long time ago and I only remember a few things...  -It was about 2 guys who tried to climb a mountain? (I think)  - I think one of them died while climbing and the other went into depression.  -He ended up living in an old train car at a ski hill?  -There was of course a woman mixed in here.  -I believe in the end he decided to climb the mountain in honor of his friend. (Not sure)  Sorry it's not much. What I can say so far is that it's not K2, but is from around that era. I have googled extensively, but have come up empty...  Maybe the Reddit hive mind will have better luck?  Thanks in advance!          I have always wanted to build a 4x mustang. I was thinking an AMC awd drive train with a 89 Ish body. Not as tall as the one in the picture.   The L6 would be awesome for low end torque too.   Keep writing, it will come.   Better than them lying to you and getting ripped to shreds on reviews.   Meow that's just silly.   Don't even worry about it. As long as you have the paperwork down for the American side...(IRS has no sense of humor btw, don't EVEN try to crack a joke with them)(Seriously) you will be just fine.   If you happen to strike it rich, remember the little guy, aka - me and when it comes time to file your taxes, talk to an agent at H+R block or come back to me for more information.    First- How much are you earning? When I last did my taxes my agent told me I wasn't earning enough from writing to bother claiming the income yet.      Jim's Mortuary, you bag em we tag em.   Or  I answer in another language, basically asking if they speak that language. Works great for telemarketers.    Depends on which of my stories you are looking at. Some are strong and independent. Others, are followers. Even others are mixing shades of either.   Just like real women, in the real world.    I have a CD from a band called Gnoma. As far as I know it's the only one in existence. Heck, if you Google them, you get nothing. Nothing. Has a rock on the cover, but it wasn't punk...much.   It's only one book but try The Event   http://www.amazon.com/Event-Jamie-Heppner-ebook/dp/B007JVCU3S/ref=sr_1_13?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1403836530 sr=1-13 keywords=jamie+heppner  Price was just lowered to.   I can tell you how to make 37k selling books. Just buy all my books first and I will tell you.   Perhaps the intro seems a touch dark, but I can assure you the story is pretty up beat. If you do take a chance on it, I would love your thoughts when you are done.       Give this one a try maybe?   http://www.amazon.com/Mirror-Thief-Jamie-Heppner-ebook/dp/B00FFRD672/ref=la_B006N2IJU2_1_8?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1403528597 sr=1-8      I already write stories for my kids, would love to see one come to life in an actual book one day...   Upvote for the panda. ;)    I took a quick look and noticed a few things.  These have just been re-published, what were the old covers like?  You decided to comment on reviews, even as going as far as calling a reader the grammar police...how is that not biting you in the backside?  I wanted to hate you, but I can't. If you really are making the money you say, it's a jealous problem on my end. I like your latest covers. Simple but nice. Not my tastes, but then again that's why they are my tastes.  It's nice to know a fellow Canadian, and neighbour, can do so well as an indie.  Edit- Sorry are those your books or someone else's? Unclear...   Interesting...how about showing me some of yours?   You are welcome to take a look.   Here they are.  http://www.amazon.com/Jamie-Heppner/e/B006N2IJU2/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1388676465 sr=1-2-ent    I have been published for over 3 years. At best I see $100 a month with 3 titles under my belt. Normally, I see around $10-15 a month. Don't expect to get rich unless you are already famous.   Sadly transmissions are a big job, I know, just dumped mine. I can't help because of distance, but it might be better to look for a new-other vehicle. Good luck either way!   Would you be more interested in the paperbacks or is an e-reader better for you?  And thank you. Every bit helps.    Thank you.   I have been on a long link of bad lately. Even snapped at a friend because she had a run of good luck.  This too shall pass, just a touch of help wouldn't hurt.     If you got this far, thank you again for looking.   http://www.amazon.com/Jamie-Heppner/e/B006N2IJU2/ref=la_B006N2IJU2_pg_1?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_82%3AB006N2IJU2 ie=UTF8 qid=1402419793   Punched a hole through my transmission last week. So far I am looking at over 2k to have it fixed. Both my kids inherited my wife's jaw problems, we have decided to fix it now while they are young, than wait till they are teens and spend 10x as much. My work, same job for over 20 years, was just hit with a major loss as our CEO and friend passed away. This has shaken the company pretty hard.   Yep, what's next? I ask myself that too.  So off the top I want you to know, I am not looking for money, at least not directly. I have no problem with earning my money.  I work hard, but it's tough, you all know it's tough. So I am asking for a trade.  I write books. And I have them available in e-book and paperback. I am hoping that even a few of you might be interested in what I write. It's not a perfect solution, but every sale I make helps out in the future.   I have seen the power of Reddit do awesome things.  Thanks for your time, and the link to my work will be in the comments.   Untitled, original project.   Just did this in Canada, can confirm it works. Thanks!   No disrespect taken!   After all, I am in the public eye. If I can't take a touch of critisism, well...I best exit stage left. And I agree with what you said. Honestly I typed this up in a rush at about 2 minutes before my head hit the pillow last night. If you are up to a re-read, here is the actual bite from the back of the book. I wouldn't mind hearing your take on it.    His parents ignore him.  His motorcycle is trashed from the accident.  He has nowhere to sleep, no money left, and no job to earn more.  With few options open to him, Dario's future is dark, and depression is sneaking around the frame of his world. That is until his fingers push through the boundary of the reflection in front of him, and he learns that he can move through a world that others can only see.  Now...can he use this to fix the errors of his past, or will crime be the only option?   Some one needs to buy one of these so we can see what is really on it...   Dario woke in a hospital bed. His bike ruined, his family dismissive, and his job now gone. His stay in the hospital now just one more trouble on an already long list. That is until he finds out he can now enter the worlds inside of a mirror. Will this be an escape from the troubles that haunt him or just another thorn in his side?   Thank you for taking a look at my work. Please note that it is going on sale as of tomorrow (June 2nd) and will be on sale for three days. Hope you like it!          You will find a group of helpful caring individuals. Unlike most of reddit. The few who raise voices of disdain are usually silenced quickly by the mods. It's a great place to stretch your creativity.     Nice! I like the elephant. Looks awesome. Ever try your hand in /redditgetsdrawn ?   Any chance you want to link the art?    You have really tiny hands.   Or you can kill him the first time you see him and not fight him at all at the ballistas.    So...US only?    If you don't build a man cave - game room around this, I will be very disappointed in you.   Well, it's free, and linked to goodreads...not a retailer. I can see how it would be considered promotion, while at the same time, it's not. But gotcha. Thanks anyway?!      In Soviet Russia...No! Too busy! You go now.   Dry ice. But I didn't really 'find' it.      Bonus points if you own a purple pinto running on petrol.   Mirror Thief is an alternate take on a reality we all take for granted.  It's just a reflection to you, but to him it's a second reality.   Music sooths even the most savage of beasts.   Future Jumper Series on Amazon might be to your tastes.    It's the silence inside the mirror that speaks the loudest.       Looks interesting, but I think the ties end quickly.    It's just a reflection. Until Dario's fingers pushed through the boundary and a world of possibilies opened before him.   Nothing wrong with R.R. Martin, but know his story isn't finished, and he really leaves you hanging.  Course you do have 4 huge books to work through...   I burned up a good 5 minutes on a torch showing this to another player. Felt great when they finally got it.      301 now...         Just lags out. So... I'll take a copy for PC please. :-)    Unless you point something out we all missed. You are looking at a picture of the beach. Self explanatory.   The problem of having a fully geared player atfack you at SL 10, is gone. There are new problems now. You will still have plenty of fun though. Enjoy!   I'm still waiting on that last panel myself....   For an indie author try the Future Jumper Series, by Jamie Heppner.  http://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Unbound-Future-Jumper-books-ebook/dp/B00HUHM2WK/ref=la_B006N2IJU2_1_13?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1398911323 sr=1-13   Mirror Thief by Jamie Heppner...of course in this case, reflective might be skewed...  :-)    Up vote for Sauce!   I have a few out actually...  Here is a link if you are truly interested.   http://www.amazon.com/Jamie-Heppner/e/B006N2IJU2/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1398263093 sr=1-2-ent   I typed out a longer description. Bit more detail. I don't want to name the particular person because it would make me as bad as they are.    You got it. See above please.  	110
          Interesting. I remember hearing Metro Station's [Shake It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wjFahULCK8), which was released in 2008 about seven years before its release, multiple times. I even told other people who agreed that they could remember hearing it years before 2008.         She has the jaw, forehead, and lips of a man.   Serbian war crimes?         China, with its millions and millions of lonely men will develop a huge sex industry if the situation doesn't change anytime soon. Porn will be rampant and have a huge market. Many women will take advantage of the situation by becoming prostitutes, strippers, porn stars, and escorts. Men will take advantage by being pimps, opening up strip clubs, distributing pornography, acting in porn, or even crossdressing to prostitute themselves as women. Some of those who profit off the situation may become very wealthy.            Well, I have been reading a little too much /r/futurology lately and a lot of the commenters predict a bleak future for driving, but I'm not sure if that's because they think that's what will happen or what they want to happen.               Jaguar F-Type                  Affluenza   /r/glitch_in_the_matrix         Taxes are lowered for the rich, increased for everybody else.

As much as I am disgusted by smoking, I can still tell that banning tobacco would be a step in the wrong direction.   Nice to see that there are other young people and other redditors out there who like 70s American cars.   Also, do they sell it in Germany or Austria?  I've always thought the same thing about "SS" cars.   Something will happen if the Republican Party doesn't get any younger and ages out.         Well, this turned into a circlejerk real quickly. No pun intended.   Toyota Land Cruiser. Starts at 80k and looks like a bigger, blander version of the Sequoia. Not a bad truck until you realize that the Range Rover Sport and Cadillac Escalade start at about the same price and actually look like what you pay for them.      https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/1963_Jaguar_XK-E_Roadster.jpg   America will no longer have a two-party system. The Libertarian, Green, and Independent parties will grow.      Makes sense now that you say it.   Found a render of what a coupe version of the current gen CTS could look like,  http://tripedali.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Cadillac-2015-CTS-V-Coupe.jpg   Don't think Iv'e ever seen one in person, I imagined it being bigger than a CTS coupe though.            ~~[Cadillac ELR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_ELR)~~   - Morgan makes modern cars that look like they are from the 1920s-30s.  - The Bentley Arnage and Chrysler 300 are big and boxy like 80s cars.  - The 2000-09 Jaguar XJ has the same basic shape as the 1968 XJ.   I could see this potentially resulting in a Waco or Ruby Ridge style siege if the government finds out and feels that enough illegal activity is occurring there.                  He probably did, if you consider that this happened, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nyou_eKlr0U   Euro coins have been counterfeited, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2886170/Chinese-criminal-gangs-master-ability-create-perfect-euro-2-coins-investigators-reveal-shipments-forgeries-arriving-Italy.html   3D printing will increase crime by making it easier to make homemade guns, knockoff goods, copies of keys, fake credit cards, fake IDs, and counterfeit coins.      Think quickly, honk, and do whatever you can. Move over, brake, or speed up depending on the situation. I've nearly been nudged twice by drivers changing lanes without looking at 30-45 mph. In your case it sounds like the other car got in front of you and was on your front bumper. I'm imagining that I would have to brake to make room for them and try to notice early. Being in New York I'm pretty used to assholes not signaling and cutting other cars off. Having a dashcam would probably also be beneficial.   The wheels might be big though, 19-20 inch rims are optional on the S Class. Also, Acura has a similar looking lighting system on some of their cars.   Because he doesn't understand that the CLS is a high tech luxury car. My mom says she used to be able to wash the interior of her bare bones 1970 Chevy Nova with a garden hose.      To me it looks like an $80-$110k car, but I could see it being priced lower since Lincoln has generally priced its cars lower than the European counterparts.   Will it be a Livery cab/Uber/rental car like the Town Car, a near-luxury sedan like the Chrysler 300, or an actual competitor with cars such as the Lexus LS and Mercedes S550?  http://m.caranddriver.com/news/lincoln-continental-concept-revealed-news   That sounds a lot like Ancient Rome or Greece.            Holy shit, I instantly thought Mitsubishi Mirage as the answer to the question. Then I look at the article and see a picture of the Mirage.      What if he is right?  Ha what? Google, Audi, Mercedes, freightliner and who knows what other companies have already driven a combined million+ miles, and crossed the US driverlessly. Technology companies like apple, uber, Delphi, Cisco systems, and nvidia are all competing to release driverless car technology.   That doesn't mean that the technology will become mainstream or be perfected.  There are already mass produced cars on the road today that have lane departure warnings, emergency braking, self parking, and adaptive cruise control features.  Electronic driver assist features and self driving cars are not the same thing.  The government is making rules mandating technology that will allow vehicles to communicate with each other, which is pretty much the biggest barrier to autonomous vehicle technology working on a large scale.   This is still very early in development and may be used either in autonomous or human driven cars.  And pretty much every single car manufacturer in existence will readily admit that autonomous cars are an inevitability. Your prediction is wrong you fudgetosser.   If they don't become an inevatibility, that wouldn't be the first time a prediction of the future didn't come true.            You might be able to get a better "normal" Crown Vic for the same price.    -70 points and still not hidden and labelled "score below threshold".   A lot of 80s American cars looked like Rolls Royces, http://i.imgur.com/F6h2JtA.jpg   Boxy style or round style?   I actually don't see it as ugly. It's not the prettiest, but still a decent, simple, elegant design for what it is, http://www.collectorcarads.com/Picture1/Pontiac1985003.jpg         I thought of this because every year used to feel different to me, but not anymore. 2013, 2014, and 2015 have all felt the same to me, even though there have been major changes in my life since 2013.  Edit: also watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Chfoo9NBEow      Morgan, Backdraft, Factory Five, AC, TVR, and Wiesmann are some successful, long lasting, niche sports car manufacturers.      The OLdsmobile Diesel engines used in 1977-85 GM cars, such as the Bonneville were terribly unreliable, http://www.autosavant.com/2009/08/11/the-cars-that-killed-gm-the-oldsmobile-diesel/   Whatever you do, don't touch it if its a diesel.   /r/shittyphotoshop      Mature means miniaturized, mass produced, cheap, and little room for new improvements. Most current tech is at its height and future technologies such as A.I. are either as far as they will get, will not catch on, or may be banned. It's interesting that you mentioned AI because many experts, such as Steven Hawking and Bill Gates believe that it will end humanity if it becomes too advanced. If enough support their view, certain forms of AI may be banned.   Sprinter van?   I watched some of his videos and can't tell what kind of mental illness he's suffering from. He also wasn't a bad looking guy before getting his face covered in tattoos.   Reminds me of this annoying teacher I used to have.   Not as shitty as GG Allin's tattoos were.   So do I, that's part of why I hate him and am fascinated by him at the same time.   It is since there was never a Mercury over there.   Its called 5 Seconds of Summer, but there's 4 of them.         I linked to that because it is a screenshot from those notorious PSAs, and you spelled "writing" wrong.         But I guess that doesn't work for green mod comments.

I realized that Playback FM in GTA San Andreas is called an "old school hip hop" station, yet the songs range in year from 1987-1992. This means that the oldest songs are 5 years old and the newest one is from the year the game takes place.   http://static1.squarespace.com/static/52e28821e4b07cd558a3e967/t/54f9ece4e4b0251d5319bd83/1425665253965/you-wouldnt-download-a-car-1-728.jpg      Should have written "continue to coexist", but I just wrote coexist because they haven't become widespread everywhere yet.   By coexist I mean be chosen by different people with different needs and preferences, kind of like diesel and gasoline has been for decades.      742 Evergreen Terrace         Real people do dumb shit. Who's not going to strap-on a Go-Pro and try car surfing when the car can't crash? Wanna bang in the back seat while Robo-Bob drives? etc... There's going to be some sort of freak accident where some family drowns when the car drives on a correctly mapped road through a flash-flood or something a human driver could have easily avoided.  Thats one of the things that makes me worry about self driving cars. They will bring out people's stupidity because they trust the computer too much. I could also see a trend of dumb kids jumping in front of self driving cars to see if they get hit or not occuring.  The main problem I see with trucks would seem to be that the absence of a human operator combined with accident avoidance software would seem to make such vehicles easy targets for criminals (cargo hijackers).  Couldn't the trucks be manned by guards even if they are self driving?   The fact that the current concepts are slow and overly cautious, cannot be used in harsh conditions, and don't recognize the color of traffic lights in the sun are some more problems.      I ask this because most of the news regarding them seems to be made of hype and because similar concepts which were said to be the future of transportation such as [Personal Rapid Transit](http://www.tbd.com/blogs/tbd-on-foot/2011/07/metro-history-the-1970s-thrill-surrounding-personal-rapid-transit-prt--11713.html) and flying cars were tested in in the 1950's-80's but were never perfected and never became widely used.   I have wondered if electric will replace fuel or if it will coexist with it like diesel does with gasoline now.   Gombe Chimpanzee War  Cannibalism (zoology)  Cannibalism  German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war  World War II  Hitler         Yeah, there's plenty of family sedans these days that are as fast or faster than any Ferrari built before the 80s.      The scary thing is that she looks so normal.  Edit: she looks like someone who would post on /r/awwschwitz.   I didn't notice this when I copied and pasted the caption.   Who beat and verbally berated him and the other Jackson kids while they were growing up. He is a psychopath who mainly used his kids as a way to make money.   Heavy Metal Trailer Trash         Buffalo Bill meets Michael Meyers   The legs on the girl to the left of her look too thin.   Kind of like how some parts of the U.S. still looked like the 50's back in the late 60s-early 70s.      Looks like a scrotum.      Looks like he has yet to grow out of his wannabe gangster phase that started in 8th grade.      These jokes are getting old.   Nice Porsche   miata   [I did post this on /r/shitty_car_mods a while ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/Shitty_Car_Mods/comments/36ys0w/the_worst_thing_to_put_on_a_german_car/)  and this question would be better suited for /r/carscirclejerk   He can't go 120 on the highway if he doesn't want to be "that guy".   Did he say he ever actually went 120 on the highway? Whether he did or not, this is still a dumb question that should be self-explanatory for him.      Right, but in the case of the Matrix/Vibe and 3000GT/Stealth etc. didnt both companies own shares in each other?   The iA clearly looks like a Mazda 3, the iM looks more like a Prius or CT. I guess they could be on the same platform, but I never knew that Toyota/Scion owned Mazda.   The iM looks like a rebadged Lexus CT.  	162
       Note there is absolutely no basis for the ban and that the organisation was wrongly excluded from the previous years' march. There's not the slightest indication of any homophobia or discrimination from CAFE. This is ban is 100% political, perhaps even more political than the UKIP ban in the UK.                        Remember, you can still rate them on Yelp and you can also rate and comment on 90+ youtube videos:  http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/joe-dimaggio-childrens-hospital-hollywood-2      When hospitals violate the human rights of children and intentional harms those they're supposed to protect then people are inevitably going to make their voices heard.  If the only concern is a few angry phone calls then I'd say the protesters are showing a huge amount of restraint and should be commended for remaining peaceful and conducting the protests in a lawful manner.   Surely the doctor wants arresting first?                     Chase's genital mutilation is scheduled for Thursday 11th June at Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital in Florida. I'm sure I don't need to explain the details of this case, but here's some background for those who are new to it: http://savingchase.org/news   **Please help to protect Chase by letting the hospital know what they're doing is completely unethical, non consensual and constitutes severe child abuse.**  You can phone the hospital on 954-265-5324  Tweets should go to @JDCHospital and they've posted on their Facebook about the controversy, with the post currently open to replies  There will also be protests outside the hospital: 1005 Joe Dimaggio Drive http://intactnews.org/node/807/1433866992/dr-gary-birken-protest        Please also share various articles about the case on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter: http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/breaking-news/reports-of-boys-looming-circumcision-cause-campaig/nmYwp/          To be fair, the number of deaths is pretty small when you consider the number of circumcisions carried out. Far more common are lesser complications from the surgery, such as infections and the loss of all or parts of the penis. You won't exactly hear a lot of guys talking about that either becasue it's not exactly something people will mention for fun is it?   The key men's rights info is found a long way down in the article. It reads as follows:   Ethan, who was born in January 2012, has lived with his mother since his parents split up in February 2013.    Legal proceedings between his parents began a month later when Mr Williams applied for contact with Ethan.   Magistrates ordered that he should have contact with Ethan in the presence of Ms Minnock from August 2013, but this broke down two months later.   In January 2014 Ms Minnock made allegations against Mr Williams. These were all rejected by a district judge in April 2014.   In February, a district judge found further allegations by Ms Minnock had been 'fabricated' to 'frustrate contact'.          It is still done today in certain parts of the world.   ok then, FGM   Child sacrifice used to be pretty common is some cultures/relgions, your arguments would fully support that too.      The victims are almost always babies. Obviously you won't haver met any of them becasue none lived for more than a few months, they dont' get to ever be your age.   Why are so many people so determined to mutilate, harm and sexually abuse young children and babies?         The following link will play every single video on the JDCH youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpxqGrAIYDY list=UUAFZs5cx3bu-0hYHmBu1tsg  You can "dislike" a video then simply press "next" (the double arrow facing right) to skip to the next one. It takes about 5 minutes to dislike every single one of their videos!  Almost all videos have comments open too, so one you've finished with Facebook start commenting on their videos too.   It was made into a cream and Oprah smeared it all over her face   (this is actually the most accurate answer you've had so far)   Great, unfortunately there are those out there whose penises do not work properly thanks to their circumcisions. Furthermore there are hundreds out there who don't get to even post about their circumcision complications on Reddit because they're now dead thanks to the surgery.   One parent is in favour of the genital mutilation and the other only "agreed" after being held in a prison cell and forced to "consent". As for the actual victim, he doesn't' consent to a knife being taken to his genitals either It's an absolutely outrageous case.   There aren't any personal/private contact details given. All it involves is contacting the hospital and an office, surely this is allowed? I've just noticed that someone made a similar post at r/intactivists.  Would the sticky be ok if we remove the doctor's email?     It's traumatic at every age.                     Sorry but any article concerning gender issues that interviews someone as vile and dishonest as Michael Flood really is not credible. In terms of male feminists he really is the worst of the worst.   Cue the grammar activists.    Any person (man or woman) who is likely to abuse their partner will not change their behaviour because of a poster.   I'd disagree in this particular case. You're correct that any poster which simply repeats messages already firmly embedded into the attitudes of society will have zero impact (e.g. "never hit a woman"). Violence against men, particularly by women, is seem as acceptable, deserved and even comedic. Therefore an innovative poster campaign that actually confronts problematic prevailing attitudes is actually of real value.  The posters may not be enough to stop most female abusers, but it may cause bystanders to say something o (or at least not applaud and laugh).                                          Because the blog adds extremely important insights about the author of the original report      Even if it did then it's totally legal. The BBC are required to be neutral so any such offences by them are a million times more significant than what any other broadcaster or newspaper does. Any request for a"follow up piece" is nonsensical due to the different ways the organisations are funded - if the BBC wants to be as bad as the papers then it needs to abolish the licence fee first.            That seems like a pretty ageist statement. Clearly young men are hugely impacted by sexism in society, though there's a hell of a lot of issues for older men to face too. Young men generally don't have kids (or at least haven't' been through a terrible divorce and lost all contact with them (and most of theri money) while still paying child support). Suicide also impacts on old and young men alike and wihle treatment for younger men's cancers is pretty good, it's the older men with prostate cancer who are the ones facing real discrimination and appalling care.  If age rally bothers you, then you'll be pleased to know that (from what I've seen) most of the senior members of CAFE are all pretty young, though tbh I think it's great to have a whole mix of ages (and genders) working together and above all else the best and most dedicated person for the job.   That pink hair ruins any possible poker face instantly. If you were placing bets on who would try to silence the event then i expect almost anyone would be able to guess who would be the guilty ones.    and delete it   Wouldn't it be a shame if the attempted censorship failed and resulted in increased donations to CAFE and therefore more such talks in future..  Donation link: http://equalitycanada.com/donation/         So predictable, how many such incidents have there been now? We must be approaching double figures.         When the whole heath tourism HIV thing was is the news a while back there was an article by a homosexual HIV patient who complain about how health tourism already made it harder for him to get treatment. So refusing to treat HIV health tourists would actually help many in British gay community quite considerably.      Looking forward to hearing some jokes from Toksvig about a high profile female who's had a mastectomy..            That's three years old and so doesn't explain the outcome (they won a few days ago).                           The Mirror is an incredibly dubious source, about as bad as it gets really. I'd say that there's a 50% chance that any info from the Mirror is false.         The issue is that she's sort of apologised for what she did, and yet clearly continues to support this kind of hate 100%.               Yes but in this case she's just as dumb and unethical today.                                 Also, as stated on their website:  "If you encounter discrimination or behaviour that makes you uncomfortable: if you are comfortable doing so, respectfully intervene by telling the person that you feel they are being disrespectful and would like them to stop"   https://web.archive.org/web/20150506040858/http://edmontonbikes.ca/services/bikeworks/women-transgender-days/                 Hi, I'm something of an expert on Symantec's filter and it's impact on men's rights site. I wrote numerous articles on this issue back in 2013 and complied lists of sites it's blocks as "hate". I've gone right to teh top of the company with my concerns and their policy of smearing and defaming the overwhelming majority of men's human rights sites as "hate" is entirely deliberate and they're not planning on changing the classifications.  Some articles:  * http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2013/02/the-48-mens-human-rights-sites-feminists-seek-to-censor/comments/ * http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2013/03/now-official-o2-and-symantec-believe-helping-male-victims-of-domestic-violence-and-sex-abuse-is-hate.html * http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2013/05/o2-and-symantec-admit-that-fathers-rights-arent-hateful.html * http://www.avoiceformen.com/misandry/symantec-o2-still-censoringdefaming-mhra-sites/                   Not really, she still hasn't resigned/sacked or been banned from campus or even apologised for that matter.   Not really, more like the flaw with launching a no confidence motion while people have extremely important exams to focus on.   The university can't actually get rid of her becasue she's an employee of the student's union. Perhaps the only option open to them would be to ban her from the campus.

It's perfectly reasonable to post an update. If you don't like this particular story just read something else.                  And yet again it's a male child who dies.                     Hi Suzanne,  I really admire how you decided to make shared parenting a part of your manifesto. UKIP are the only major party to do this and I'd really like to thank you personally for the work you've done in this area  There are also a great many other equality issues concerning men and boys, all of which are also totally ignored by LibLabCon and I was wondering if you'd looking into any of these? For example we currently have the genital mutilation of children funded by the NHS (without their consent) and there are vast gender inequalities (all caused by the state) in relation to cancer care, domestic violence support, education and the justice system.  I really feel that if you took the same approach to the above issues that you've taken to parenting, then you'd gain even more support next time around (and of course it's the right thing to do as well). Would love you hear your thoughts.   There was a men's rights group in London a few years back, they did some good stuff, I'm sure some of those involved are still around.      An interesting case, courts have been incredibly reluctant to enforce contact orders in the past, so hopefully this shows they'll start taking these issues more seriously in future.            Fantastic news. Real progress!                                       Well we don't know for sure that she's paid, but that tends to be the case for almost all of these positions.               The police weren't the ones who introduced laws to make her action illegal, and to be fair there have been other police forces who've gone after people for significantly less extreme tweets and behaviour than this.   It's fairly common for graduates to try to get elected as a SU officer. It's such an easy job and so allows them to avoid real work for a year (or more in some cases). Right now she's being paid to be racist and sexist against white male students, a dream job for many SJWs really.   People in the UK have gone to prison for tweets that were less extreme than Mustafa's.         Nice to see a range of J4MB members on camera for a change. i think this is the first time a female J4MB supporter has been shown in the media.      I thought it was a fairly reasonable and honest article, so i don't mind them having a little revenue in this isntance.   The author is probably just trying to write a clickbait rage article, so I've used an archive link.            She has Turkish ancestry though technically Boris Johnson does too.   **This is the actual official Goldsmith's no confidence petition that can get her fired. 3% of Goldsmiths students need to sign it for her to lose her job:**  http://www.goldsmithssu.org/news/article/6013/Petition-regarding-no-confidence-in-an-SU-officer/   Perhaps it includes police officers and government workers?   Actually that's an extremely relevant comment. In the documentary GMP admitted they've never prosecuted a single false rape accuser ever!    https://web.archive.org/web/20150517211511/http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/15/behind-the-scenes-at-a-police-rape-team-bbc-documentary   "But unlike other forces, GMP has never prosecuted a victim for making a false allegation"  (the info is in the second to last paragraph)                           The term "genocide" was actually coined to describe the actions of Turks towards Armenians and other minorities!   It has bee posted at each stage of its development. First we had the initial scandal, then we had her "male tears" images, then we had her "defence" (and posts of the relevant video) and now fianlyl we've got posts about petitions and about her Twitter hate activity.   She claims to be Turkish, it's not as if they've ever committed genocide on an absolutely staggering scale or anything.   The comments are actually still there, it's just that they've hidden them by sorting them by "new". So it's basically censorship, but they get to pretend that the comments aren't censored.   **Remember you can resubmit your complaint so it is reviewed! Just go through the complaints process again and quote the relevant reference number.**  Most people never have any success first time around.  If that fails then there's still further opportunities to escalate the complaint to an even high level.  	199
 I feel you. The scenery is cool, but WHY GOD WHY another poison level? Also I wish they had more engaging and interesting enemy placements early on like the Drakeblood knights instead of relying on mindless zombie foot-soldiers like so many other levels. I agree it's the weakest part of the DLC.   Shulva isn't too bad but I save the other two for end-game, they're pretty tough. Except frigid outskirts. Did it once, never again. Fuck that place.      LOL    Weird, I named my charizard Drogon last play through    Dankwald sounds like a dank place to live    Yeah my friends just saw her at Movement this year too, she still gets out haha   First time: 15 hrs second time: 2 hrs (once you do a couple NG+ playthroughs you'll be reaching Anor Londo in your sleep)       lmao    Drain it and throw a warehouse party!   Yeah, seriously I love a good mech but it's like some of the posters on this sub base their entire identities around keyboards..I just feel bad.   Well said chap!    Wow I believed this too until I got further down the thread... Btw thanks for doing this AMA, love you and the show!    Fumey is a more challenging fight but Sir Alonne has my favourite lore  besides Velstadt.    Sir Alonne is the master! respect!    Same here on my most recent playthrough. Summons just kept messing up my dodge timings, found it easier solo.    Pretty slick, like the design.    I know i dropped that nug around here somewhere....   lol that explains a lot. I was so confused after reading all this shit about enemy placements in SOTFS and then never actually coming across them in game. (e.g. Heide knights before the Cathedral of Blue)    lol that's actually what I use as my chime! I haven't actually tried fighting with it though, I just love the way it looks. I'll give it a shot in combat today!     Xbox 360    Really? I have only ever played the SOTFS edition and mine is still found just after the Pursuer boss fight.  I wonder if the PC and the console versions of SOTFS are different, because i've also heard things like the repair cost for Ring of Life Protection going up to 14k but it's still only 3k for me on 360...    Yeah at first I liked the red cape but now I can't stand it after going through my entire first playthrough with it. I love Llewelyn, reminds me a lot of the Nightwatcher cloaks from GoT    Not wallpapers but if you're a big fan of Stroboscopic Artefacts art you might enjoy this blog. It's super active and I regularly go on it to find links to artwork or just for inspiration. http://otakugangsta.com   Yeah you're right, one thing i've come to notice about the Souls games is that the best strategies for killing them are usually the lamest. Dodge around, wait for combo to end, attack or heal, repeat...  Dodging and getting down tight timings is fun, but I'd love to have a system that encourages head on fighting and more viable options for those who prefer aggressive tank play styles, instead of always just kite or be killed.    Lol I just tried out the grand lance against Velstadt. I ended up ditching the shield early in and just two handing it but yeah I rekt him first try, definitely a good suggestion! And may I just say damn what a difference agility makes with dodging in that fight. My first playthrough I never put anything into ADP and fights like Velstadt and Fume were soo much harder!    yeah sorry I thought it was redundant but they're definitely Heides, got them whilst farming for the set.    Perfect, I actually have the grand lance and lance already just for fucking around with. I'll definitely have to give them a shot. I like that I can have my shield up too.    Alright so i'm well into my third play-through on my original character, and i'm just wondering if I could be optimizing my damage/protection a little bit more.   I'm a str build knight with 40 faith for sunlight blade. I have been using a Drakeblood Greatsword+5 paired with the lightening clutch because the DBGS also has lightning damage already. I know certain weapons definitely do more scaling str damage outright (great club, mastodon GS, Zwei) but I find the agile moveset and low stamina-per-swing cost of the lighter (6.0) Drakeblood sword much easier for boss fights.   Soo I'm sorta just wondering if there's an even better dps weapon for this sort of play style that I might have overlooked.  Also, for armour generally I do my own fashion souls thing but sometimes I need extra protection if a boss is just kicking my ass for some reason. Is there any better set in terms of weight to defence ratio than fully upgraded Drangleic? I've tried the Heide set, Drakeblood set, Elite Knight set, Loyce set... nothing seems quite as good.    techno as fuck    Seriously this is all I ever see on that sub now.  There were like two today. Why are all these bitches knitting gaming shit now anyway?   Is this feature only for Japan?   Just enjoy it for what it is, it won't ruin Dark Souls trust me. Definitely not as memorable a method of story telling or general atmosphere, but the gameplay is still as addictive as any other Souls game and from a logistical standpoint many aspects have certainly been improved.    Man I always knew BKS was amazing against demons but damn I didn't think it could one shot bosses. This was just in NG right?    I agree with the points you made on level design, but personally I appreciate the difficulty of the new bosses like the Fume Knight and the Kings Pets duo. They're completely optional end-game dlc bosses, why shouldn't they put up a good fight? Fume knight is my favourite fight by far because of the large and unpredictable move set.     Awesome! :)    Depends on who you are I guess haha. I love parrying, even in pve. Feels badass parrying a pursuer or a alonne knight.   It's not that hard, just comes down to timing. No better place to learn than FoFG   Yeah str builds are my fave. Makes every boss fight more intimate, ya know?  Oh and one last tip- If you're playing online don't always trust the highest rated message haha   Like others here have said, you just need to adjust your strategy a bit if you're used to playing BB. Up your defence game, get your dodge timings down and if you're really stuck go back and farm a few levels.  I find for the Lost Sinner, like most fast, small and aggressive bosses, it's easiest to dodge consecutive hits to the right (their left) and hug them with lock on. (make sure you can at least medium roll with an equip load less than 70%) This way you can quickly dodge behind them to either get in a few hits or heal up before they start the new attack combo. If you like using shields to block consider finding a spear, as you can thrust attack while keeping your shield up with them.   What are the giant sentinel things guarding Anor Londo in the hall then? They have the same armour as the giant set. Are they the same species as Gwyn or are they related to the blacksmith/Sens giants?   Learn how to parry if you haven't already got it down. It will definitely help down the road in certain circumstances, especially early game.   High dps ranged magic or hexes trivialize a lot of the boss fights, if you prefer a challenge/more of a sense of achievement go melee.  And don't fight near wooden chests, if you smash them you lose whatever was inside and just get rubbish..       I donno man, that kinda looks like he's repping the house of pride. :P  I can see why they went with the look they did in the show, the armour is just more consistent with the Kings Landing aesthetic they've created.     ..O S are only the hardest if you don't do the dlc.. trust. Also they're a lot harder if you solo them, definitely look for npcs to interact with along your journey :P   They'll definitely give you a run for your money your first play through though.    What is your guy's "boss music?" Or do you just listen to the games score every time? I appreciate a good soundtrack and I definitely always listen to it the first couple times around, but sometimes it just feels so great when you're kicking a bosses ass to your personal favourite battle jams. For me its Berghain techno or UK dubstep, depending on the pace and the setting. Sir Alonne? battlemarch drum techno. Iron Golem? ass numbing dub vibes. What about you guys?   This would explain why she went off course to kill Stannis... You might as well complete all the objectives in an area before heading back to town for the exp.    We need hypeman Petyr Baelish announcing them UFC style as they jog out into the ring to a trap remix of Next Episode by Dre and Snoop   YES   Every campaign mission I ever played ended like that last panel..    I know i've seen that pic, I was jk   I agree, it wasn't very well thought out. I felt like the bonfires had better placements in the DLCs (for the most part), like you actually had to work to find them and the places they were in made sense.    Smough before he let himself go   Seriously? I did the same thing but killed Siegmeyer and went on to the next game like nothing happened. Cold as fuck.    lol you really don't like that Sinners Rise bonfire do you?    damn. k thanks.    I have my 35 loyce souls in my inventory but I get no new dialogue from Alsanna and the ice on the stairs hasn't receded at all yet. Is there something else to it i'm not doing right or did they increase the number of souls required in SotFS?    I think it's because this type of post has already been done before (pineapple drawing handed in as school project and posted to r/trees) so to some it just seems like a rip-off to reap some karma.   Kill me now   I think Rush definitely gets the attention they deserve by now, they're the plot device to a Hollywood comedy for fuck sakes. Pretty much everyone in Canada knows a few Rush songs, for better or for worse.     One time I reflex attacked Onion bro in the cathedral in Anor Londo. Super sad :(  Glad in DaS2 they gave you a bit of leeway with accidentally hitting npcs.    If you like fantasy stories about knights and lords with lots of weapons, armour, combat, power struggles and demons/monsters then you can't go wrong. Also it's Japanese so expect lots of fucked up sex scenes and gratuitous gore/disturbing imagery.  Story is on point though, it hits home for a lot of people. The characters aren't black and white, or pure good and pure evil, which makes things more interesting and less clichd.     Right? I was picturing a robot ninja like the one from the movie Robot Ninja...    Am I missing something? All this video did was demonstrate that we have the ability to use a robotic arm to precisely mimic human arm movements (which shouldn't come as a surprise to people given we already use them to laser cut complex designs to perfection). It's not like the machine bests him in a standoff. Barely even shows what the human was capable of, anybody can hack apart bamboo stalks or slice an orange in half for a camera...    I just watched the Eclipse scene with 0 foresight into what was going to happen and damn... that escalated quickly.   	64
 The best movie adaption is probably the Matthew Series or the Jesus Film.  Jesus Film (practically translated into every language possible) http://www.jesusfilm.org/  Visual Bible : Matthew  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fc8qOXeTsUQ  Personally, i thought Killing Jesus got the gist of the stories pretty accurately. Granted its not word for word but it also doesnt slide too much away from it.    I think all the business that are discriminating against Illinois and the media are to blame. Personally, if any business that boycotted my state I would personally make sure that no money was going back to fund them. If you're going to interfere with the welfare of my citizens and provoke threats to influence something against our legalisation without any merit then you dont deserve to make any profits off of our state.    Touche. I mistakenly thought u said it was a "sub" or something. My bad.   Its called a hoagie around here   Religion is rules you have to follow. A relationship with Christ requires just faith.    Herbal Essence! Enough said      I hear ya. Lose the religion but dont lose the faith.   It's not her intelligence that pissed me off. But it seemed like she wanted everything her way. I guess she wanted to feel safe and in control.    Yea for a short time when she almost said Yes to getting married to me.  Initially she didnt want to marry me but then after sweet talking to her for a while I got her to a point where she would agree to marry me. But then it went all downhill because she got offended that I was asking her family about was she meant by her being "rebellious". She tried to explain it to me once and I was able to grasp some of what she was saying but I couldnt really hear her.   What she meant by being rebellious is that "she has to do the right thing regardless of the consequences" which honestly didnt matter but the attitude that took place in her explaining it to me just put me off. not to mention she avoided talking to me for a while.    lol i did runaway. but part of me still wants to go back because I enjoyed the small times when I did make her happy.   Yea this is from the talk. We talked for about few weeks. First I wasn't sure if she was my type but alot of the family members wanted us to be together and so did I but I was put off by her attitude.    So I was in India a while ago for getting hitched for an arranged marriage. My parents introduced me to a girl and I just felt very confused and aggravated with her at the time because I really feared her attitude towards me. I felt disrespected.  So the reason for my post isnt to rant but to figure out few things.  a) I felt that I felt like my man card was being taken away from me because she was putting me down, controlling and had a rude tone. b) She would misunderstand alot of things I said.   1) How do I stop getting offended by being told off by a woman? She was def. smarter than me so I felt offended. 2) She said she was rebellious and that just made me fear for alot of conflicts down the road. Was I wrong about this?         **tl;dr**: Potential mate was disrespecting me. How should I have handled it?   i feel like im missing some thing in this image?    What I'm noticing is that alot of people are living in fear. Lots of atrocities are taking place around the world. Should we start to assume that we are truly living in the End Times or is this just life?   I think by the end of the year she wont have any organs left.    Would http://www.7cupsoftea.com be of any help?  Its free counseling.  I cant even imagine being in your boat. But I'm glad that you're willing to fight this!   I could be wrong but you need someone who can love you unconditionally. A good friend or partner. I hope you find someone soon.    I have trained under him and one of his approved classes in Nj.  He's really good and focuses on making sure your technique is correct above everything else.     Core workouts.  Weaker your core is the weaker your moves will be. But dont worry they will instruct all that into you. Id recommend cardio too.    As someone from Killadelphia aka Philadelphia, PA USA, Charlotte seemed like a great place. People were friendly and courteous.    We like to solve problems that help people.   I'll let you figure out what that means for you.  Personally im a software engineer, but always wanted to be a pilot, and could be a pastor. Lol.    Do you guys ever take on other peoples fears and anxieties?  I feel like if someone throws any fear and doubt on my way then I might initally guard myself against it but then I usually will take that upon me.  Not sure if its a personality issue or something else.   Please upvote then :)   All criterias have to be good.  So you cant say Criteria she meets 1. Shes beautiful  Criteria she doesnt meet 1. Shes ugly  It would have to be all good but few that you would be willing to let go off.   More like January 2017. But the campaign for the next president starts pretty much now so Obama will have to be extra careful with Israel or he loses not only the Jewish vote and its influences but the votes of many conservatives.   You mean his PR team did.    Most companies provide $5k for educational expenses per year as an included benefit of working there. See if the company you are getting hired for has that option.   What kind of a job offers that much money. I have a Masters in SE and make 80k. What the heck am i doing wrong? lol   Hes making 200k+ who cares.    Use glassdoor.com or salary to gauge at what someone with the proposed title should make in the area. Offer that and say you're willing to bargain if its an issue, etc.   Take the job and get a Masters part-time while your company pays for it. Masters in Comp Sci for the most part is just a regurgitation of your Bachelors degree except this time its more in-depth and you have to read/write more research papers. It def. boosts your salary but honestly current companies want experience over degree. Enterprise companies will boost your salary for a grad degree but you will notice that you are significantly behind your peers in programming language acumen because you were focused on research and crap.  Oh and one last tip. Focus on being a well-rounded programmer. Dont focus on the money. I chose money and now I'm in a tough situation right now on moving forward in my career. Nothing too crazy but wish I had been a well rounded programmer rather than dedicated maintaining some custom-built project that gave me skills that i cant easily transfer to other companies.  tl;dr : Get a job. Have them pay for your Masters part-time.    lets hope you're right   Pharoah was alot of fun wasnt it   R u speaking from experience?   I couldnt take my eyes off of either actress lol. But Vaani was really good too.    Anyone else watched this movie?   I loved it. I thought the storyline and acting was great and hilarious. I could totally relate to the guy and interactions he was having so made the movie very enjoyable.   Id encourage u to seek this.  Im in the same boat as you. No idea why i feel this way but i have been going to counseling and it is helping me a little get a better control of it.   Oh wow i had forgotten about that   The most logical answer lol   Mutual funds, etfs, gold      Totally agree.  Homework believe it or not is going to be the best thing to help you do the best down the road. And you can make lots of mistakes in high school and it wont matter. But that wont fly in college when you have a short timeframe and are under pressure from a bunch of equal weigted classes.   In a nutshell study and do those homework problems.

I don't mind having conversations like this, because I enjoy telling moderators when they're fucking up the sub with asinine rules that filter out quality submissions.   Great so I created an album with both big-ass topical maps, and automod deleted it because you only allow single-image posts. That seems like such an arbitrary rule, do you want people to spam with multiple maps regarding the same topic because they can't submit an album?            Yeah an article about the huge-ass map that's embedded. Fine, I'll resubmit.

 Off the top of my head for the things that aren't pictured are, stainless steel braided brake lines, most of the emissions equipment is gone, heater and ac was removed, turbo S sway bars, and poly bushings. I'm pretty sure there's more stuff that I'm forgetting, but as for other mods, gutted interior, Autopower roll cage, Momo Daytona seat, Momo steering wheel, rebuilt calipers, stoptech rotors, Hawk HP Plus race pads, fiberglass header panel, and a custom billet shifter.

A full M030 setup came up on rennlist a while ago, definitely wish I got it now. The rear end just feels so soggy on it.   Yeah yeah yeah Burt versus Myers videos never get old. I still understand how people can race there. My dad crews on an SK team at Stafford and even there is pretty hectic.   No coilovers, all the other suspension is stock right now.

Right now, I'm just trying to get the car buttoned up so if can be ready for the first PCA autocross this Sunday    No hablo germano   Upgarage is the best, I got a brand new Watanabe for only $40. Also, super jelly of all the cars. Especially the Rauh Welts   M'Vette   I'd be terrified to do Lemons with the base Autopower... I'm cringing just thinking about it    It is in an Autopower. There's no way in hell I would actually race with that cage. Not to mention the fact that the windshield bar is way too close to your face. I'm not exactly sure how those cages can be SCCA, or PCA legal. My dad is on an asphalt modified team, so we're going to work with their chassis builder and have them build something for us. Also, the door bars are pretty useless because they don't come above the seat    Already subbed    Yes, there are plates underneath it.

Little bit of a back story and some things that are not shown. I bought the car back in 2013 from a family friend. It's a 1986 944 NA that is going to be my track/autocross car. Not all of the work is shown in the album, but this is what else has been done to it -Turbo S sway bars -Poly bushings -Welded diagonal and harness bar on the cage -Momo steel seat brackets -No AC or heat My goal is to start doing 944 Spec next year so it's been quite a slow process. I really don't have much else planned for it besides bringing it to spec. It's been a great car so far, and hopefully this will be the first of many Porsches I will own.   Okay, you guys win. But only because you asked nicely   I'll work on an album tonight. It probably won't be posted until tomorrow though       Yeah, I'm not going to lie, I miss the super tacky ricers   That's actually an awesome idea.

    Welcome /u/jorgepal02 to r/stopdrinking--At [this link is a post called the Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is an accurate summary of what I did to stop drinking and get sober.  I still do these things.  Good luck and I hope I see you continue to post and comment as you go along.      That's great, /u/saltwatermonkey -- when you get and stay sober you get your life back.   Congratulations on 7 years SOBER.  I just put an invite to join us on /r/dinos in your inbox.              There are absolutists among philosophers of honesty.  For instance leaving a false impression or creating a misimpression is also lying.  We have an affirmative duty in my opinion to correct lies.  Which is my  way of saying that I'm not advocating white lies with this post; I'm saying let us not justify unnecessary cruelty to others under the guise of "brutal honesty."     I think this is a valid point.  The constant lying about and covering up for my drinking were more than enough to cause all sorts of distortions in my character.     Wonderful.  What a great sensation that is.     I am not going to drink TODAY because I am not going to drive drunk with people in my car.  I've done that too, my young children.     In early sobriety I ill-advisably dated (and briefly lived with) a young woman, Audrey, who long timers on /r/stopdrinking have heard me speak of in past posts and comments usually in the context of why it's not a good idea to date in early sobriety.  One of Audrey's most striking characteristics was her tendency to pop off to her "friends" or newcomers in AA in a manner in which she would shrug and say, "'Sorry, I'm brutally honest." Except she wasn't, she was merely brutal.  This week while we talk about Honesty remember that in striving to be more honest, we can not and should not justify our rude and unsupportive behavior as "brutal honesty."  In sobriety we reserve brutal honesty for the man or woman in the mirror.    When my SO asks if she looks fat in a dress, skirt, slacks--no amount of karma was ever earned by saying "Yes."   The person who is brutally honest enjoys the brutality quite as much as the honesty. Possibly more.  Richard Needham, (1912-1996) Canadian educator and cartoonist.

So what you're saying is: he doesn't have a buck to his name?   Yeah, I think you're wrong about Graham's position on torture.  Remember this is McCain's closest Senate ally and my recollection is that the two of them are zealously anti-torture.   Maybe the last of my generation, then.  It's a little dated at this point, but I thought it captured some core truths.   The 7th or 8th drink was never my downfall.  It was always the first.   While I don't sympathize with Graham's let's-fight-every-war obsession; I don't think it's fair to label him a Chicken Hawk.  Until recently he was a commissioned US Air Force JAG officer--not likely to see action, but still someone in military service.   I may be the last person in recovery to have seen [*28 Days*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0191754/) with Sandra Bullock, but I really liked her navigation from the bottom-drinker to someone in recovery.  It's ordinary, and as a result I liked it.   Good luck, /u/randoker -- you may have hit upon a strategy that's effective for you.  Not really, for the long term.     Welcome /u/WMWA to r/stopdrinking--I was able to stop drinking and get sober doing the things I describe at the [Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Why don't you see if anything there seems helpful to you in your effort--best of luck to you and your GF.   Why do you think that is?  Let's talk.   This [is the link to the post from the FAQ; What do drinking dreams mean](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/) which I wrote after exchanging emails with dream researchers.     No problem; the title was in the original with my insertion of "Louisiana," only for clarification.  It was not my intention to editorialize.   I remember this well, a_o, I was at the event earlier in the day and, of course, I have coffee near there every morning.  But more significant to me was that a guy I know in AA was the first responder on the scene.  He opened the door of the drunk driver's car after his fellow first responders attended to the dead and other injured.  He describes recoiling from the smell of alcohol and the driver in a panic asking, "Are they dead?"    Honesty is accepting that when I drank and drove, it could have been me.             Don't feel bad for Alabama, this ass-clown was impeached and then the voters re-elected him to the bench.   LOL!  Inauthentic dumbass pretends otherwise.                     Not going to happen.  Reince Preibus is not a candidate for the Profiles in Courage award.   Great comment, I totally agree.  One of the things that I find most offensive is this politician's successful attack on the liberty to contract, and enforce contract rights.  We would not tolerate this ransacking of the Rule of Law in a close foreign ally, but many applaud Walker as the second coming?!            I wrote this [post on Drinking Dreams after exchanging emails with leading dream researchers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/)  There's good news for recovery in this post.        I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; honestly!   Perfect!   Ha, Ha, well-done, KJ!     That's not my experience.     In AA I was able to drop the mask.   As an active AA, within the fellowship just one dishonest predator can devastate a recovery community and drive out newcomers like crazy.  How can you spot this sort of character?  And what might you do to protect yourself?   For one thing, newcomers should be wary of too private a contact.  Solid supportive relationships form in the OPEN.  When someone sounds too good to be true; they probably are.  Remember, in recovery we are all drunks and addicts, so someone presenting as totally together isn't.  Other ideas?   Best wishes, /u/comiju on day one!  [At this link is the Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is a post I wrote about some simple "next" actions to getting and staying sober.   I WAS a liar.  I did not really appreciate it at the time.  I thought I was an honest person.  In reality I lied to achieve and gather to myself that which I valued.  I lied to manage how I was perceived.  Before I got sober and even for sometime after I got sober, I was a reflexive liar.  I have described how in March of 1986 I drunkenly fell down sustaining a quadriceps injury that required that my leg be placed in air cast.  This injury began my long effort to get and stay sober.  Remarkably every time I was asked about how I injured myself I told a different story.  Sometimes two irreconcilable versions to the same person.  During that same period, an administrative hearing officer told me that I had developed the unfortunate reputation for being not a serious or credible person.  That was my rock bottom.  But even after I stopped drinking the struggle to get honest and be honest was a real struggle, but as I learned ESSENTIAL to getting sober.  Ralph Waldop Emerson gave the following advice: "Speak what you think today in hard words and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said today.   I call this getting molecularly honest.  And the person I needed to get honest with most in the world is ME.  Over the years and through my actions, only--I think I have been able to change the way the people who I most care about in the world see me.  I believe that today, I am perceived to be honest and trustworthy.  This has been a long haul, but it is the character asset that is most valuable to me in the world.  It is a gift of sobriety.  The simple step of a courageous individual is not to take part in the lie. One word of truth outweighs the world. --Alexandr Solzenitsyn     I propose that in addition to all of our normal posts, comments, advice, and sobriety (and life)-threatening issues--that we think and talk about HONESTY.  Especially about how getting honest was prerequisite to getting sober and getting to quality sobriety.     I challenge you to raise your hand and "re-introduce" yourself.   Welcome /u/bagaiste to r/stopdrinking.  This is a great and supportive community.  I like to share the [Baby Steps post with](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) the newcomers as a place to look for "next" things to do as you get sober.  If anything resonates there for you, terrific.  Best of luck.        LPT: Be yourself, everyone else is taken.    Source: Oscar Wilde   Good for you.  Keep doing what you're doing.   I'm sitting here at my computer sipping my homemade iced tea--happily chatting on SD.  I am not going to drink TODAY.   It is said that alcohol is but a symptom or our "disease."  Personally, that was true for me, but amazingly after I undertook to stop drinking (which I did via [the things I describe at the Baby Steps post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) my underlying mental health issues were much improved.  In other words I was able to ACT MY WAY INTO better mental health.  Bill Wilson, one of the co-founders of AA describes in the book, Alcoholics Anonymous aka the Big Book that he had access to the leading mental health and addiction specialists of the day (1920s-1930s) and that self knowledge did not keep him sober.  So, /u/MenstrualJackson, we are not alone.    Good luck to you.   How can I hate myself and yet be obsessed with how I appear to others?   How can I want to destroy myself but spend a fortune for custom tailored suits and shirts?  I do these things BECAUSE I am not honest.  I am not honest because I am afraid of rejection, pain, and further diminishment.   Ooooh good one.  So true, too.    If I am to get sober, and stay sober I need to honestly see the man in the mirror for who I am.  Sometimes I am weak, sometimes strong; often vulnerable and fearful; but, trying one day at a time to be more and more accepting of what is real, rejecting my fantasy thinking and embracing life on life's terms.     I can't think of why not.  AA is not a monolithic society.  AA is made up of people like you and me.      Good for you, and welcome.     I'll never give up hope double-D.  You DO have it in you.

Thanks for being an important part of the whole.   You obviously don't read the NYT opinion section.  Setting aside the constant stream of conservative free lance contributors and conservative office holders the NYT is where William Safire went after his time as Nixon speech writer; where David Brooks, and Ross Douthat have permanent columns.  You right wing types really need to drop the whole resentment-trope, it's unbecoming.   Your comment made a vague and meaningless point that purported to refute the well-reasoned essay of a Southern journalist and historian--your comment was nonsense.      [Howell Raines is a journalist from the deep south.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howell_Raines)  He worked as a journalist at the Birmingham Post, the Atlanta Journal Constitution, and the St. Petersburg Times. He wrote an oral history of the Civil Rights movement and a history of the deep South.  I suspect he might have slightly more insight into the politics and history of the South than your average NYT reporter.   Forty-two days and depressed?  This in my experience is totally normal, because it takes time to recover from the assault on the body, brain and central nervous system that we were doing with alcohol in the period (years?) before we stopped.  I guarantee that give it some time and you will feel so much better.  If the mood does not lift, please by all means don't drink and see a licensed professional.   While you technically are correct about the remaining southern democratic holdouts--[Howell Raines is correct and you don't know what you are talking about.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy)         This is a brilliant essay by Howell Raines.         This is a powerful post that gets at several core issues that I was speaking to someone about early, early this morning and over the past few days.  In my opinion we struggle with "honesty" or what AA calls the necessary prerequisite to sobriety: rigorous honesty--because, we want to "appear to be" smart, funny, attractive, and powerful when deep down we believe we aren't or we suspect we are fraudulent.  A personality distortion that can result from this struggle is narcissism--which is an obsessive, dishonest stage management of how we are perceived.  It's not uncommon to see people in recovery who are incredibly, even reflexively dishonest, and I suspect this also stems from not being comfortable in being in "their own skin."  I was one of these people, too.    I had to learn to be vulnerable, honest, what I came to call--molecularly honest.  That extends to EVERYTHING I say on /r/stopdrinking and frankly all the Reddit forums.  If I am to grow up, I need to embrace honestly, who I am.  So while you felt bad, and vulnerable, /u/Englishfella -- I applaud your honesty and I am gilding you as a power of example.  Keep doing what you're doing and the next time you see your friend with the 14 years--go up to him and stick your hand out.  Congratulate him on his 14 years.  I suspect that if you can hang on to what you got, we will be celebrating you and looking to you for more wisdom.

[The Baby Steps are what I did to stop drinking and get sober.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you.   I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; free time? Someone has free time?!!   Hey, /u/divebarprincess -- I thought I shared the [Baby Steps post with you previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) but it sounds to me like you really need to talk to a licensed professional and not well-meaning but anonymous redditors.  Please keep us updated on how you're doing.   Nice! And we reached a place of indifference to alcohol.  It is not in my movie.   Wow, no kidding.  You look great.  Congratulations!   This was totally on-topic; relating to both corruption at the highest levels and the impact on local, state and national politics.  The article was by the pre-eminent Virginia political reporter and it further pertained to what "honest services" constitutes in the view of the federal courts.   One of my SD pals logs on here, periodically to itemize where he's at in terms of booze not consumed and money saved.   At last count he was closing in on a year and the totals are mind-blowing.  Trust me, he saved ten times the amount you poured down the drain last night.  In other words you aren't "down" anything.     Congratulations, /u/saltwatermonkey.   Not small at all; that's real life and if you don't pick up the next drink you have a chance a whole new and authentic life.   Check the pic--all the donors lined up to give "Hedge" a check.            I think Rubio has more than once disqualified himself for higher office.  This is one more example.   The [ethical rules](http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/mrpc/mcpr.authcheckdam.pdf) that apply to all lawyers tell us that all persons deserve competent and professional representation (the rules adopted in most states used to say zealous representation, but that idea justified unacceptable distortions in professional conduct). The rules also remind professionals that just because a matter involves repugnant or controversial allegations, that in and of itself does not justify declining to represent a client.  Remember if a person comes into an emergency room with gunshot wounds received in the commission of a crime, an emergency room provider won't decline medical services, right?  Having undertaken a representation, competent and professional lawyers pursue every defense, challenging everything from jurisdiction (the power to render judgment in a matter), investigation into facts, challenges based on the law applicable to the facts--so as to hold the prosecution to EVERY element of the government's burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  It is not the job of the lawyer to judge a client--the people, the finders of fact and of law will do that.  The lawyer is ultimately just one of the advocates in an imperfect system of justice.      It was never one glass for me either.  In fact, when I was drinking I would deliberately avoid just one drink because of how uncomfortable and miserable I would feel.  I was a PIG drinker who once I started would not stop until I was in a stupor.   Yeah, this is a common issue.  I think it was /u/offtherocks who said, mark-off the first two weeks on your calendar for a bumpy ride.

AA meetings helped me through this sort of quandary about what to do.  Especially when I was in new surroundings.  There I found people who understand me.  Especially other Irish binge drinkers.   In addition to the excellent advice of my pal, /u/juden-shikker -- I found an attitude of ALL-IN made a lot of difference.  Let me add one more observation: persistence, one more day, one more day...and, then the miracle occurred for me.     Nice!  Action not words is the path to sobriety in my experience--and, fitness is action.

Obviously, following your doctor's advice is huge and very smart.  Good luck to you.   At supper an hour ago, I said essentially these words to my wife.  In fact add the fact that I am a white guy born in the deep south, you get no argument from me that this flag is an offense to my black brothers and sisters.  As flawed as I am personally, that flag should no longer be officially in the face of black Americans.   What worked for me in terms of stopping drinking wasn't fear of liver failure or wet brain--instead, being sick and tired all the time and hoping, knowing if I stopped that I could turn my life around.  In other words it wasn't death--it was the certainty that there is life.  I stopped drinking and I got sober by doing [the simple things I describe at this link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you.   I found all the support I needed and more, in AA meetings.   The [least popular advice in early sobriety is dry people, dry places.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2szkp8/the_least_popular_advice_dry_people_dry_places/?ref=search_posts)   Here's what I did: [the Baby Steps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  And like you I recognized that my drinking was endangering not only my health but putting my children at risk (mine from driving impaired with them in the back seat of my car.)  I had to take ACTION.     I love AA and I avidly work an AA program, but I agree you hear a lot of stupid shit in AA meetings sometimes.  I try not to judge, but I'd like to think that I've reached a point where I developed some discernment between substance and utter bollocks.   Remember even with substantial time sober, these are many of the same drunk clowns who made sitting on a barstool insufferable.  As Slip likes to point out, some are sicker than others.   Personally, I would be going to /r/alanon meetings to learn some coping strategies with my brother's alcoholism.  A lot of us in recovery are "double winners" so to speak; and it looks like you might be one too.  The other thing is I would have to look long and hard--as you are doing--with what you thought you were doing with the cans of beer.  Remember anger and resentment are the chief offenders for relapse.  Good on you for posting about this; because I've been there and all I needed was one good excuse and I spent 7 years in relapse hell.  Don't go there, it's not worth it.  Most of us don't make it back.      That lovely young woman was the original Lolita.      Caught cheating, go figure.      It's the daily conservative hit job.   Or Jonah Goldberg.   But it is true that when the NYPOST decides to target you there are NO holds barred.  It's unremitting, scurrilous, and defamatory (if you aren't a public figure.)  This is the Fox News machine in tabloid print.                 I'm really happy for you.  Yeah, my home group, a large commuter AA meeting was laughing with me when I said that I too didn't want to be a member of this AA Cult.  For 22 of the last 29 years the AA sober life boat and path has  been saving my life and giving me a path to discovering my authentic self.   My psychologist called this: The Safe Harbor of Pain.                          Not a problem. We might disagree about what's on or offtopic but I never violate the titling rule.   That was EXACTLY the title of the article at the time I posted it.  I do not alter titles.  The website title changed after I linked it.   Good luck today, /u/imaginarylindsay -- and here is my [Baby Steps post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  In my opinion it's a pretty decent place to start stopping.   Sweet dreams, /u/chickenhips!   Hilarious!    I have a client from Cornwall, the accent!  Is that even English?                              I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; TGIF SD world!      Good job /u/sarah_never!   This is politics in action, in the most dramatic sense.  All politics are local.   Alcoholism, or an alcohol disorder, or an alcohol addiction is more than a bad habit, or a bad choice according to medical and mental health professionals.  For many alcoholics if not most it is an intractable disease resulting in misery and premature death--so it is DAMN HARD to quit drinking or to stay stopped on will power alone.  What to do?  I did the things I describe at the [Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  It may sound like semantics, but I never "quit drinking."  Instead I make a daily decision not to drink TODAY, only--no matter what happens good or bad.  I tough out the tough hours.  I doggedly persist for one day.  One Day.  Then I do it again.  Amazingly, it get's easier--after the first tough days, and the first couple of bumpy weeks as long as I don't pick up the next drink.  Key to my success was throwing myself head first into recovery.  All-in.  A real commitment.    That my friend is my best recommendation for trying again.  Make a decision, go all-in, doggedly persist, repeat.  Good luck.                  I feel bad that you felt that way; and as a long time AA and the OP  of the [Big Book Study Group](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=big+book+study+group restrict_sr=on sort=relevance t=all) you wandered into the reading of the most insane and sexist  chapter in the Big Book, in my opinion.    I don't disagree with this.  I think he's a little nuts having heard him extemporize and call a Ohio State Trooper, a jerk because the officer  pulled him over for speeding.  But he is competent and way-too-sane by GOP standards.   I believe you are correct.   In the famous words of George H.W., that's "the brown one."          We are talking about why the POTUS should have continuous "security" 24/7 versus the Ohio taxpayers paying for security for a governor who ran for a full term fully intending to become a part-timer on the taxpayer's dime when he ran for President.  If that's illogical to you, then you might consider a refresher course on logic, maybe somewhere other than a home school, this time.    [At this link.](https://www.animallaw.info/statute/tn-good-samaritan-dogs-cars)   Good for you.  It may well be that AA didn't work for you, because you when you went "you had one foot out the door" so to speak.  For me, being ALL-IN made all the difference.   The difference is that the POTUS travels with redundant offices, communications, and staff to remain in continuous contact with the levers of his office: e.g. Air Force One.    Name-calling because you disagree is childish.     Kasich is hardly governor 24/7 when he is running around the country running for POTUS.     Here's how I would see that based on years sober:  we can not foresee the future.  In recovery, I've seen all sorts of families form, families of affiliation, new families, and recovery families.  But newly sober, and in pain and regret we can't imagine feeling OK again, free, and happy.  I've seen with my own eyes, miracles in recovery.    	191

I am going along so I am looking for somewhere that an English speaking Western traveller can easily meet up with people to travel bits of the journey with.

We'd have preferred "Jolly good show"      Just watch a summary of current world news   Washing up      When 9/11 happened, some people chose to burn to death, but around 200 people chose to jump - knowing they would die.   People who choose euthanasia make a similar choice - a quick death vs a long slow painful death from disease.  I understand why people chose to jump in 9/11, I understand why people choose to die with dignity in a hospital - I think euthanasia should be legalised.   Go to the press   They're individually asking 173 countries if they'll accept you on principle   Yes, technically true.            Given that approximately 40% of the world population has internet access, I would be a lot more careful about making guarantees.       Anyone know what we did to change from 1929  We  had the Great Depression and lots and lots of people went bankrupt....

Read the article - we're not there yet.  Dr Rob Buckle, head of regenerative medicine at the MRC, said:   "This research is an exciting *early* step towards that goal, and a convincing demonstration of the potential power of direct reprogramming technology, by which once cell type is converted to another. However, much more work will be needed before this process can be reproduced in the lab environment, and in a safe and tightly controlled way suitable for use in humans."   Yes, we have the first stage of growing organs - there will be a lot of animal research before that gets anywhere near a person. They still need to get over transplant rejection, getting organs to proper size (among other issues). Your suggestion that we were already at a stage where this was a usable technology was nonsense.   What planet are you on?!  "We can now grow new organs with stem cells" No, no we can't!!   Why doesn't the future require liver or kidney damage studies? Are people who suffer organ failure worth less in your opinion?   It depend which minorities. If you look at those who arrived recently - such as Romanians, Bulgarians etc, then yes, they are doing worse - there is a lot of prejudice in our system.  The Indians, the Poles, the Chinese, are all doing pretty well in our system these days.   The group that tends to come closest to the bottom is white working class British - draw what conclusions you want from that   Well the LD50 is rarely used - it's not a particularly useful test - I mean any dosage that kills half a group of mice is clearly too high (when weight adjusted) for humans.   There is a lot more to animal research than toxicology - most of it is about understanding the processes going on. So, for the macular degenration I expect there were a lot of studies working out which stem cells were key to the formation of the eye, and what effect they have when implanted into an adult eye etc.   Stem cell treatments are developed using animal studies. So the recent stem cell treatment for age related macular degeneration was only possible because of knowledge derived from mouse and primate tests.  http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/oct/15/stem-cell-success-in-treating-macular-degeneration   Move to Britain.

I tip my hat, and you tip your wallet. The deal is done.    *tips hat before turning around and walking mysteriously into the night*   I graduated from Oxford Uni seven years ago. A few thoughts.  First off. There are great minds everywhere, from the top uni to the bottom, and many great minds that never went at all. That said, you are likely to find that Harvard/Oxford(etc) have a high proportion of very clever people than at lower ranked universities.   You will find great tutors at all universities. I will go one step further and say that Harvard/Oxford does not necessarily have the best tutors/lecturers. Whereas as a small American liberal arts college may hire a professor for their teaching abilities, top universities tend to hire great academics (those who excel in their field), and top academics do not necessarily make great tutors and lecturers. In my time at Oxford I had great and terrible lecturers. Of my two best tutors, one was a DPhil student (the other was Prof Mayhew).   Comparing my experience with friends, the major differences between my university and some "lower ranked" universities was:  - Workload: I was expected to read up for, and write, two x 2000 word essays per week. The reading list would be 8-20 books/papers for each. In fact, learning to read quickly and effectively is the single biggest skill I took away from Oxford. One consequence is people cover a lot of ground very fast. One third of my first year was economics, yet I covered more economic theory in my first year than some friends at other universities did in their first year.  - Connections: I met a lot of very driven people, many of whom are on the path to becoming very successful. The contacts I made at Oxford will last a lifetime. The "Oxford" name obviously helps - many employers, rightly or wrongly, would prefer to hire an Oxbridge graduate over (probably equally able) other people.  - Great minds: The tutorial system at Oxford - whereby two people are grilled by each other and a professor each week for an hour - sharpens your mind. It makes you able to vocalise your thoughts concisely and confidently. You are constantly challenged by people who are as smart or smarter.       It's contagious...   Russia and America are very different places.   Russia is much more autocratic (see democracy index), has lower standards of living (about half the GDP/Person (PPP), is more corrupt (US ranked 19th best, Russia ranked 127th).  Much less media freedom, more repressive laws (consider that in Russia promoting a gay agenda is a crime) .... there are many differences.   It's going to be a faff if we need to use 5 digits, maybe we can reset every 10,000 years         Was in science communication. Became a maths/economics teacher for 3 years. Returned to science communication after.  No regrets.   Can someone clarify. Are the nasal ensheathing cells a form of stem cell?         Great to see the background studies that made this possible      It's not a better or worse training programme, it's a different approach. What it does do, is get people who may not have considered teaching, into the profession, a proportion of whom stay on for years.   Remember that "traditional" routes into teaching have similar high drop out rates over the first 3 years of teaching.   Most first year teachers don't know how to manage behaviour - TFA or otherwise. My experience in the UK suggests to me that after the first year (where PGCE students have done some teaching and learning, and Teach First (UK version of TFA) have done a year teaching on their own) the Teach First'ers were a lot better equipped to deal with behaviour.   While some of the UK academies have failed, they have generally outperformed non-academies, and certainly turned round many under performing schools. There are issues with academies, but I wouldn't call the whole programme a failure.

And then Steam isn't recognising all the files in the new folder and is downloading them all over again   Can't add a folder which is not empty   All my games ARE on a separate hard drive. But they all get installed initially to the SSD and then moved off to a second drive using steamtool.   FFXIII was different because the installation appears to require about 80GB (even though the game is only 60GB), which is more than I have spare on the SSD.    I have FFXIII on the G:\ with a SteamTool link pointing at it from my C:\ steamapps\common game directory (as with all my games).  Normally If I then "installed" a game that was there it would find the game and not feel the need to reinstall, but instead it's trying to redownload the entire 50GB game.   I know the game is working as I can play it by using the launcher in its current location, but Steam library thinks it is uninstalled.   I have enough disk space to download FFXIII (with about 10GB to spare - it's a small SSD).  When I finish, I plan to use SteamTool to move it to another drive where all my other games are:  BUT  Steam is creating a 20GB "downloading" folder in addition to the 43GB it's downloaded so far (of 49.4GB of the game).

 It could be a failure of their label printing procedure, and in reality they just didn't have a value for the CBD test (i.e. their software may be converting a null value to 0.0%).  Seems more likely than not as that figure with that precision being true is improbable without some GMO cannabis with the enzyme knocked out.    OP explicitly framed this as a hypothetical question not related to actual differences in cruelty within any particular existing supply chain.    It's one thing to breed a creature to be good food and then use it as food. It's entirely another to breed it to be a companion and then use it as food.  So in your view, what makes it wrong to kill dogs as food?  Because that's not the best way to use them?  I'm having a hard time seeing how the way human beings have bred the animal makes it better or worse to kill it and eat it.   So if Republicans do what they say they do, I am happy as my wallet is untouched (or less touched) and I carry on with my life  I don't think you have an accurate view of what Republicans say they want to do.  Like, I get they sometimes say they want smaller government and less taxes, but they also say they want:  * Increased military budget * Increased domestic spying + budget * Increased / maintained subsidies for agriculture and fossil fuel (varies slightly by state) * Increased federal grants for militarizing local police forces to combat TERROERRISISMMMS  Etc.  These are all common public positions for Republicans these days.  It doesn't make sense to value their abstract statements of position (e.g. "I'm for small government") over the concrete one's (e.g. "Increase the defense budget!"); where they conflict, the concrete position is all that matters, as it is the only one that is reasonably predictive of behavior.   Well, that seems quite unreasonable.  Lets see some numbers to support your belief that live shows are what small-time artists live off of.   Take a look around bandcamp, for example.  There are a ton of small-time artists on there selling a lot of units and keeping most of the proceeds.  Their artists made ~$3 million last month from fans buying music and merchandise.  Artists keep 85% of the revenue when you buy music from them on bandcamp.  Lot of small-time artists sell a lot of digital albums there; when you're living on working-class level income, even just a few hundred dollars a month is a big deal (i.e. a few dozen albums sold).  Local and regional artists can sell a ton of digital tracks, but they can't play unlimited shows, and most of what they play doesn't pay very well.  When your gigs are in local businesses (e.g. bars, cafes, artist's collectives) and you play to audiences of a couple dozen, you make a few hundred bucks, split it up among the band, and hope to do this a few nights each week.   Go to a high end electronics store to try headphones out, then buy online.  If you're buying high-end phones ($200+) and you want to save money, buy a factory refurbished model on ebay for as much as half-price.  This is what I do, and have been doing for years, for my home studio monitoring and mixing phones.  Let's me buy much better headphones for my budget.   Yeah, /r/internetparents could be a good place to get advice.  Or just /r/askreddit or the superior /r/trueaskreddit .   Are there other, related situations that also scare you?  What was it about the grocery store that made you uncomfortable?  A lot of people will advise a young person who's apprehensive about getting work to go and do it anyway, as it's an important step in growing up, etc.  I pretty much agree, but I also think it's worthwhile for you to consider *why* this is so unsettling for you before going forward.  It sounds like you have much more apprehension than most people would in your situation, and I think you should go into the situation prepared with some awareness of why you're having this anxiety and what you can do to manage it.   I don't understand.  Your father won't let you go to college, or your father doesn't want to pay for it?   Perhaps a social movement toward communal, parallel support systems could come from the middle class but extend participation and membership to the working class once underway, if those involved were aware of the problems you mention.  For example:  educated middle-class anarchists could start an agrarian commune that then actively recruits wage slaves to join them and expand together.   If you go to the doctor with a complaint about magnesium deficiency (and they aren't able to convince you you don't have it), they can have it tested along with your usual stuff (same sample, nothing special).  if you have normal serum magnesium the odds are still pretty high you have insufficient quantities.  I wonder if you have any evidence to support this claim that isn't from someone trying to sell us magnesium...sounds like a proposition that won't allow itself to be refuted: "You probably have magnesium deficiency, but tests only show *severe* deficiency so your doctor won't be able to find it."   I think you're an outlier there; most people I've known who drink are pretty reasonable about it and have few negative side effects.  I have known plenty of people, myself included, who have no desire to drink more than one or two drinks over the course of any particular evening.   /r/stopdrinking isn't appropriate, because OP wants to get advice about how to figure out whether their boyfriend has a drinking problem, not only advice about how to intervene.  If OP goes to /r/stopdrinking they'll probably assume it's a drinking problem and go straight to the advice about how to intervene.   /r/askdrugs   I doubt you'll be able to find any source of magnesium glycinate or a similar supplement where the bulk material didn't originate in China.  If you do, please post here.   Sounds like you could use a new thread - that's a whole topic of its own.  I'd be happy to discuss it if you make a debate thread here.   I asked because you seemed to think it was strange for the initial shooter to have missed the crowd, which suggested to me that you were unaware of how difficult it is to actually hit anything intentionally with a firearm.  Is precisely why vigilante Uber drivers playing ametuer SWAT are bad policy.  I don't believe this is anybody's policy.  Like many people on this sub, I see gun control as a complex political issue.  A government monopoly on use of firearms in public is not necessarily a good thing, even if there are downsides to some or all of the alternatives.   Not that I saw, no.  I based what I said on the fact that their target was near a crowd of people, and they fired several shots into him.  Seems likely the second shooter was trained as they apparently didn't miss.   How about a sticky linking to a more appropriate sub in *not all caps* instead?  /r/tripsit   Do you have any first-hand experience with firearms?  It's common for an untrained or distracted individual to miss all kinds of large targets, even at relatively close range.  It does seem like the second shooter was very lucky not to hit anybody else, though.   There's no way you get this to work with a ping around 200ms, as others have said...way too high for this kind of gameplay.  But could this be done using a local network?  If you got the ping down around 20ms I think it should feel tight enough for something resembling SSB gameplay.   There is no evidence that the classical psychedelic drugs have any neurotoxic effects relevant to normal human use.  Most of them have been in use by humans for thousands of years, and all have been used heavily for the last ~60 years and have been studied scientifically to assess safety.  If there was a substantial risk of neurotoxicity in the usual dosage range and use pattern, we would know by now.  There is some evidence for mild cardiac risk, and individuals with heart disease / at risk for heart disease should exercise caution (as they must for any activity that strains the heart).  MDMA is a completely different substance and situation; it is an amphetamine with known potential for neurotoxicity, not unlike that in other amphetamines.  Existing data suggests that MDMA is sometimes neurotoxic at doses used recreationally, but much more research is needed to produce reliable, specific dosage and setting recommendations.  Recent studies have begun to establish safety for low-moderate doses in a controlled environment - you can read up on MAPS and their PTSD studies to learn more about this.  You say:  I really just want to live a healthy life with some experiences to the daily life. I want to keep both my brain and body in good shape, and have looked in to nootropics a bit, but perhaps should I keep the shrooms a bit more distant to my daily life if that's my goal.  In my opinion, you should just stick to the classical psychedelics.  Play it safe, at least until the data is in about MDMA - it shouldn't take too many more years to get a good, clear recommendation derived from good science.  The classical psychedelics will not break your brain, and in the low-moderate doses you're taking, negative experiences aren't a big deal anyway.  Perhaps in time you'll feel more comfortable and curious enough to venture into a full dose entheogenic experience; many people who've done this consider these the most profound and rewarding experiences they've had in their lives.  But you don't have to, and there is no hurry even if you are interested in it.  Good thing to read up on, and there is a wealth of good writing on the subject.   That is not relevant to mrdevlar's question, which was about finding evidence for MDMA's effects in isolation from other potentially harmful substances and behaviors.   I can't comment on the legal risk, which I assume would be highly dependant on what you said to the hospital staff, and on what region you live in.  But I will say that I think you and your partner should reconsider your assessment of whether MDMA is safe for her to take.  It sounds like she is prone to an unknown, potentially dangerous reaction to the drug.  I would not give MDMA to anybody who showed such a response unless I had a very strong reason for believing it was safe.   [9-THC-caused synaptic and memory impairments are mediated through COX-2 signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24267894)  [Preventing marijuana-induced memory problems with OTC painkillers](http://www.elsevier.com/connect/preventing-marijuana-induced-memory-problems-with-OTC-painkillers)  The first link is to the best, most recent scientific evidence I'm aware of that supports this idea; the second link is a write-up explaining that evidence for laypeople.   It's already been tested by scientists; THC induced memory problems in mice are blocked by COX2 inhibition.  You can't learn anything new about this with an n=1 self-experiment, but you can reasonably expect pretreatment with COX2 inhibitors to reduce the severity of THC induced memory problems.  Don't exceed the recommendation on the bottle for any OTC pain med; you can fuck your organs more easily than most people expect.  For chronic use, you're probably better off using curcumin, which has a better safety profile than available OTC NSAIDS.   I think this experience is largely due to interaction with all the other drugs you're on.  In particular, the cannabis, benzo, antipsychotic (lamotragine), sedative/muscle relaxant (flexeril / cyclobenzaprine), and perhaps ashwaganda are all drugs that are reasonably likely to produce fatigue when taken regularly.  What you describe is not a typical experience of caffeine dependence, but does sound a lot like a person struggling with excessive sedation.  You're taking five different classes of drugs that are all known to cause fatigue.  Trying to reduce your caffeine consumption can only make things worse for you right now; sounds like it's your way of clinging to some semblance of normal waking consciousness.  Your lifestyle, nutrition, and general health are apparently all in order.  **The only reasonable course of action is to reduce / eliminate your intake of sedatives, cannabis, muscle relaxants, and antipsychotics.**  If your doctor won't help you do this, find another doctor who isn't a pawn for the pharm industry.   MDMA and amphetamines will be clear in 5 days.  But there are some substances that MDMA is sometimes cut with that could stick around longer and show up in a standard 5 panel.  You should invest in a testing kit and test your material each time you resupply.  [They can be quite affordable if you only need to test MDMA](https://dancesafe.org/product/mecke-reagent-testing-kit/)    You *may* have had a reaction to the glycine.  It definitely wasn't the magnesium - you can get that much magnesium by eating a proper meal.  The sensations in your chest and stomach sound like GI complaints (it's certainly not your heart etc).  Perhaps your GI doesn't like glycine, or perhaps you just need to take it with food.  Regarding magnesium: **you don't know whether you're deficient**.  If you can afford it, you could just go see a doctor and get basic bloodwork done to find out.  You could also try taking the supplement more, but with food, or you could try a different magnesium supplement.  Tons of people have taken magnesium glycinate, and reports of intense side effects are rare - it's well tolerated.  But there are plenty of other forms you can try if you're so inclined.  Just don't go overboard.  You should probably pair it with calcium, but don't go overboard on that either - a 1:1 ratio by weight is fine (all that golden ratio stuff is irrelevant to amino acid chelates, and has to do with the absorption mechanism for dissociated ions).  Try taking ~500mg each and see how it goes.  It's low enough you won't hurt yourself, and high enough that it'll actually do something if you are deficient.   Sounds like woo-woo, yeah.  There are no miracles in medicine that you can prescribe yourself.  It's like the fad diet genre: no, you won't lose weight because you read my book.     The more things you add in, the less predictable your result will be (unless you have good evidence for that exact combination).  If it were me, I would stick with caffeine + theanine and/or amphetamine/methylphenidate, daily exercise, and perhaps a mild, non-GABAergic downer for sleep.  Some will argue that you would benefit from adding a racetam to your stack, and perhaps they're right.  What you need to avoid most are overstimulation and burnout, and excessive use of anxiolytics/sedatives.  Ideally, you should keep your stimulant use low enough that you're able to relax and come down without any help.  Stress fucks memory, as so do most drugs that alleviate it.   I believe that any attempt to answer this is wrong-headed unless it considers how differently human morality would have evolved had we evolved as carnivores.  The human experience of morality is the result of natural selection, just as surely as our experience of visual perception is.  If we had evolved as a successful carnivorous species, we would also have evolved a sense of morality compatible with carnivorous behavior.   Uh...  Well, I imagine you'd start to feel pretty isolated after awhile.  And, of course, all the bad things that come with smoking a fuckton of weed daily (shit memory, mild-moderate respiratory complaints), and sitting around for hours watching as screen (out of shape / bad posture).  If you're a teenager, you can add the potential for persistent cognitive problems that comes with chronic adolescent cannabis use.  So...yeah, sounds like a bad idea.  Once in a while is quite different, of course.  (bring on the downvotes i said something that wasn't A+ supergood about weed use)    I prefer to take a slightly more "rigorous" approach, and say "well, yes, the fact that this person is themselves a member of this particular demographic gives some weight to what they're saying, but we should still consider whether their narrative is representative, whether their logic withstands scrutiny, and so on." (Which means having a grasp of statistics, an ability to think critically, etc.)  The person delivering an idea is only relevant in two cases that I can identify:  either they are reporting a personal experience, or the listener lacks the time or resources to fully grasp the idea, and must base their assessment on a heuristic analysis of the speaker's characteristics and claims instead.  In the case of personal experience, the speaker's characteristics are obviously very important, because the goal of listening is not to assess the validity of some empirical claim, but is to understand this person's experience.  In the second case, the listener is incapable of fully grasping what is said, and must make a judgement based on surface appearances - whether the speaker seems credible, is trustworthy, etc.  In this case, there can be no expectation of gaining knowledge, but if you have to act immediately it may be worth deciding whether to trust the speaker based on their personal characteristics.  But in any case where the goal is to gain knowledge, and that goal is attainable, the personal characteristics of the speaker are entirely irrelevant to the assessment of whether their message is true.  Your slightly more rigorous approach will sometimes produce false beliefs, because it bases belief formation on the qualities perceived in the speaker, and not in a rational analysis of the arguments presented.  It is, therefore, entirely inappropriate if the goal of listening is to consistently produce knowledge.  So why not throw out speaker characteristics entirely, if you have the time to listen carefully?  The only way to consistently determine whether a speaker's ideas are true is to actually consider the ideas themselves in reference to prior knowledge; anything else is a heuristic, which will have a non-zero error rate in all cases.    Thank you for this thoughtful analysis.  Perhaps you can convince your stubborn friend to give it up and use /v/rationalfiction.   No - you're being seduced by very faulty thinking.  Zinc gluconate is a perfectly good zinc supplement, supported as a treatment for zinc deficiency by a fairly large body of scientific evidence.  It is not the best zinc supplement ever, but it is quite well absorbed (about 60%) and is perfectly good to use.  Who is more likely to be correct about this: the scientific community whose job it is to study nutrient absorption, or one user on Reddit?    To me this suggests that the zinc was not absorbed, since it's not showing up in any of the tests in significant amounts relative to controls.   These were healthy individuals, not folks with zinc deficiency.  It is not necessarily a bad thing that their long-term levels did not change, and these results might have been very different in a zinc-deficient population.  Though a 10-person sample size is a bit small for my taste, this again indicates to me that Zinc levels remained constant with control levels, rising only after administration of Zn glycinate.   It's not a matter of taste - it's a matter of mathematics.  This study was, by design, unable to detect anything but relative differences in absorption, and that is why the authors did not offer anything but a comparison between the two groups.  It does not offer any evidence whatsoever for a lack of absorption for gluconate - it only shows that glycinate was better absorbed.  This is counterintuitive for folks who have not studied statistics (and even some who have), but it is true.  This one confused me a bit, as it seemed to suggest that picolinate was absorbed to a lower degree than gluconate, but OP recommended Picolinate over gluconate while using this paper as a source.   Your understanding of the article is correct - in this study, picolinate was poorly absorbed relative to gluconate, which contradicts some of the claims made in this thread.  It does offer further evidence that glycinate is superior to gluconate, and that gluconate is superior to picolinate.   The inconsistency is from you drawing your *own* conclusions, and ignoring the *authors'* conclusions.   Conclusion: picolinate increased erythrocyte, gluconate did not.  No problem here, but it isn't relevant to the question at hand (whether zinc gluconate is an effective zinc supplement for normal use).  Conclusion: glycinate increased plasma, gluconate did not.  Wrong - the authors concluded that glycinate *was better absorbed*, and specifically declined to offer anything but conclusions about the *relative* differences between the two forms (because their design could only have found relative differences, not absolute).  ...  The only argument you have that makes any sense is the difference in erythrocyte uptake of different forms of zinc.  But I don't see any evidence presented that this matters at all - why do you assume that erythrocyte uptake is relevant?  Perhaps that serum increase is all that's needed.  You might claim that the first study's results prove the importance of erythrocyte uptake.  But you don't know what those results truly imply; perhaps the increased longterm uptake in picolinate is excessive, and the subjects all had healthy zinc levels at the start of the study.  So unless you have some solid evidence that erythrocyte uptake is so important that it overturns [existing scientific consensus (that gluconate is good enough)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24259556), I don't see any reason to believe you.       Hmm...can you quote the part that you think suggests this?  I'm not sure your interpretation is correct.   If you're really curious, I strongly encourage you to read the links we each submitted.  My reply in contradiction is based on having actually skimmed the sources involved, which in truth suggest that zinc gluconate is pretty well absorbed.  Being able to quickly skim scientific abstracts for the relevant findings is a very useful skill, and one which can only come with practice.   [Here's a study that found quite good absorption of zinc gluconate and citrate in humans, same sample size, healthy population](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24259556)  [Here's one that found better bioavailibility for zinc gluconate than picolinate - it's the last study that you cited](http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/22/1_MeetingAbstracts/693.3)  In fact, the studies you cite don't support your conclusion.  They even contradict each other; in the third study, bioavailibility was greater for gluconate than it was for picolinate.  The first study didn't assess acute bioavailibility, but instead looked at changes in concentration in different body parts over a long period of time.  None of your studies' authors concluded that gluconate was poorly absorbed, either.  The closest any of them get is to suggest that glycinate is better absorbed than gluconate.  The studies whose design could actually determine whether gluconate is garbage found evidence to the contrary, while some comparative studies found that glycinate is superior to gluconate (which doesn't mean gluconate sucks - just that glycinate was better).   Secondly, I would like to know if where it says "Zinc 50 mg" is shorthand for the amount of Zinc Gluconate in the pill (I've read that 10mg ZG = about 1.5mg of Elemental Zinc), or if it's indicative of the amount of elemental zinc in the pill. I've searched the internet endlessly, but all I've been able to find are dead ends in this regard.  It's 50mg of elemental zinc, at least in the United States (labeling regulations may be different elsewhere, but here, mineral supplements list the elemental).  edit:  unless the price is about the same, there isn't much point in seeking out a superior zinc supplement.  Gluconate is good enough.  It won't all be absorbed, and that is ok - 50mg would be too much zinc if absorption were perfect.  People make too big a deal out of absorption for trace minerals; it only gets important with minerals you take hundreds of milligrams of (e.g. Ca / Mg), which will cause GI problems if not well absorbed.      Isn't this old news?  I'm not seeing any reference to something *new* that Rand Paul has announced...      [My first thought](http://i.imgur.com/yQmXC8q.png)   Haha.. in my experience, microwaving firecrackers works great as long as you grind fine enough and get good contact with the peanut butter.  Microwaving herb by itself sounds like a good way to lose your herb.   You'll probably get better results if you heat them.  Just a minute-ish in the microwave would do it (or you could do the equivalent on your stove in a non-stick pan, I suppose).   This article hardly seems worth the read, much less worth posting here.  It's an amusing fact, I guess...but the article itself adds just about nothing to it.  It's barely longer than the comment thread that's already built up here.   Hmm.  Your mom being a nurse doesn't make her word into scientific evidence, and that paper is not a scientific study - it's a letter written by a company that produces and sells ibuprofen.  It cites scientific evidence, but its conclusions are pure marketing.  Some are true and some are false.  This isn't about being for or against ibuprofen, to me; it's about knowing how to make an informed decision about how and whether to use ibuprofen.  I believe that ibuprofen is a useful short-term anti-inflammatory, and I also believe that its chronic use carries a substantial risk.  I believe these things because this is what the best evidence I've been able to find suggests.  I am a firm supporter of ibuprofen when I have a fever, and a strong critic when a friend asks me if she should take it every day for the rest of her life.   Well...the evidence is much stronger for curcumin, actually.  It's been found effective in multiple well-designed trials for various forms of pain and inflammation, with the best evidence in joint disorders (e.g. arthritis).  http://examine.com/supplements/Curcumin  High dose fish oil has been examined for effects on muscle soreness, but for the most part hasn't done anything.  http://examine.com/supplements/Fish+Oil/      It's important to retain the same level of specificity as the evidence you are citing in this case.  You can't reasonably assume that a study lasting 2 weeks is applicable to continuous use for more than 2 weeks, for example - there is no clinical evidence in that entire document that supports the assertion that ibuprofen does not have deleterious effects on GI health when taken for long periods of time at OTC levels.  There is *some* epidemiological evidence for long-term GI safety presented, but most of it is not relevant to sustained use; either the study did not last long enough, or subjects using a decent dose chronically were rare.  They did present plenty of great evidence that you can take just about as much ibuprofen as you like *for 10 days*, or take a little bit occasionally forever, but I didn't see any clinical evidence, nor any strong epidemiological evidence, to support the notion that long-term high end OTC doses are safe.  Incidentally, that transcript reads like a gish-gallop attempting to establish that ibuprofen is safe for everybody any time forever cause its so great.  I wonder why...**ohhh**, it's because **it is**.  The document is an argument by Wyeth, the pharmaceutical company producing ibuprofen, which they presented to the FDA to argue their case for ibuprofen being the best thing ever.  That doesn't mean they're wrong, but it does, I think, establish that the conclusions of the paper should not be trusted naively - the *evidence* is what matters.  The evidence for long-term GI safety was not present.   I don't think there are any hard rules about this that apply across individuals and situations.  Judging for the large body of anecdotal evidence available online in the form of experience reports, it seems that when you get into the extremely high dose range (e.g. ~5000g+, or about half of a quality sheet), the incidence of reported persistent side effects increases dramatically.  Seems reasonable enough that it would, considering how ridiculously high these doses are relative to a typical mind-blowing dose of ~500g (and typical use doses of ~100 to 200g).    So I personally would not take more than about a 10-strip of good LSD, because I am not interested in having persistent side effects (e.g. HPPD).  As for frequency...people seem to vary dramatically in the degree to which they can tolerate frequent psychedelic experiences.  And individuals vary over time, as well; a person who is stressed or depressed probably couldn't tolerate tripping once a week, while that same person at another period of their life might gladly trip 3x a week for weeks on end.  But nothing is certain.  You need to decide for yourself what you will do.  Does it seem like you're getting out of touch with reality?  Maybe you shouldn't trip so often.  Did the visuals from your last trip linger for days?  Maybe don't take three 10-strips next time.     The problem is that the moral relativist would have to give equal weight to my claim that all moral claims are absolute. In other words, the moral relativist would have to believe, simultaneously, that all moral claims are relative and that I have every right to believe that all moral claims are absolute. There's a contradiction built-in. It like saying, "All moral claims are relative except the claim that all moral claims are relative, which is absolute."  A moral relativist can defend against this by showing that claims about moral relativism or absolutism are not moral claims, but are instead are claims *about moral claims*.  For example,  In one culture, it is wrong for a man to go outside without wearing a headscarf that obscures his rugged facial features and other such masculine titillations.  In another culture, it is acceptable for a man to go in public with his head uncovered.  I believe that each claim is true in its cultural context, because I believe morality is relative to culture; I see no contradiction.  A friend of mine from the first culture believes that the wrongness of male facial exhibitionism is absolute - that it is wrong for everyone, everywhere.  We disagree.  But I agree with her about everything that is right or wrong *for her*, and right or wrong *in her culture*, because morality is relative to culture as far as I am concerned.  I disagree only about her claims about *morality in other cultures*.  Those are not moral judgements - they are essentially empirical claims about the internal states that other people experience or would experience in a hypothetical situation.  Etc.   herro   Scarcity to me means the physical reality of material, not the freedom of access to it.  Freedom of access to a good presupposes that the good exists, at least the way I've used it.  What could it mean to have universal access to food if there isn't enough food to go around?  It's a contradiction in terms at best.    So when I say that post-scarcity requires only that goods are universally accessible, I mean that goods **exist** and are universally accessible.  Seems simple enough to me.  The universe has only so much matter. Human wants are infinite, physical reality is limited.  You're slipping types when you go from a finite universe to infinite wants; these are not compatible uses of the concept of infinitude.  Human wants are not infinite in this sense - they are constrained, just like every other aspect of human existence.  In the sense that is relevant, human wants are finite: for example, any particular human population has some maximum quantity of beer that it will demand, no matter how cheap beer gets.  At some point, nobody will want more beer.  Theoretically, humans will demand infinite beer at an infinitely low price (remember econ101 from high school).  But in reality, this never happens.  It doesn't even happen in actual scarcity-based economies.  You can't *actually* substitute beer for all other goods, no matter how cheap it is.  Just that are are limits to how much we can consume, because there is only so much stuff! An example of this is, the idea that if everyone lived at the American standard of living would require 2.5 Earths or something.  I agree that there are limits - I thought I made that clear.  But I disagree that the limits have any relevance to a post-scarcity economy.  They only come into play if the society is so large or so inefficient that universal access to goods cannot be ensured.  At present, our society is large and profoundly inefficient, and so we live in scarcity.  Your argument seems equivalent to claiming that it is impossible to play basketball indoors, because there is a ceiling and the ball will bounce off it and mess up the game.  Well, that would be true if the ceiling were too low.  But if the ceiling is high enough, there is no problem.  I don't have to prove that there isn't a ceiling to disprove your argument; I just have to show that it's high enough not to interfere.  I don't know at what level it would be true, but I believe it's obvious that post-scarcity human society is possible *at some level of scale and technological complexity*.  Imagine an Earth-based society with 50,000 people.  They're the only human beings on the planet, they're all educated at the post-graduate level, and they have access to all the technologies of today and the expertise required to use them.  How could they *not* produce more of everything than they want?    Irreverent. Post-scarcity is impossible. There will always be a limit, the Earth has a carrying capacity. Utopia is not possible.  Your conclusion does not follow.  Post-scarcity does not require an infinite planet - it only requires that there be enough surplus that goods are universally accessible.  At many population levels, the theoretical limit of production would never be reached - that limit is only relevant if all goods cannot be made universally available without surpassing it.  For example: carrying capacity is irrelevant if the total human population is only ~1,000,000.  In fact, it's difficult to imagine how a global technological agrarian society of that size could possibly fail to establish post-scarcity.   Awww 3  I just took a look, and yes - /r/debatefascism does have a friendly and open atmosphere on the face of it.  It seems to me that there are a lot of very frustrated people in /r/anarchism and /r/debateanarchism, who have too little tolerance for ideas they disagree with to engage in fruitful debate.  Perhaps this sub could benefit from stricter enforcement of the basic rules in the sidebar (essentially, posts that attack individuals without contributing to debate about *ideas* should be deleted).  I agree that any censorship based on views - even based on perceived naivete as to the nature of anarchism - is a very, very bad idea in a debate or political sub.   Is this meant to be ironic?  You're confirming zxz242's point rather well.   The fact that a person gets criticized for their shitty views doesn't mean that the people criticizing them are not anarchists.  Of course.  If criticism were all that happened, there would be no problem.    But how do you reply to this:  Why do people identifying as "anarchist" on reddit feel that authority figures are needed to moderate human interactions (e.g. requests for moderators to censor and ban people with different views and opinions)?  Censorship and exclusion from social interaction are not just criticism - they are, if executed by a centralized authority, forms of oppression.  Do you disagree?  Do you believe such institutions are compatible with anarchism?  Why?   Yes - you could do this with spices themselves, but you'd have to take dozens (or more) of these caps to get a dose comparable to the therapeutic doses used in studies about the anti-inflammatory effects of these spices.  Studies of curcumin (the active constituent of turmeric) generally use doses of 500 to 1000mg curcumin - equivalent to 25 to 50 *grams* of turmeric.  An 00 capsule should fit about half a gram...  It'd take a lot of capsules.   That isn't true.  You can buy dextromethorphan only preparations at drug stores in many regions.  If it's not available in your region, buy it online.  [Dextromethorphan only cough gels on ebay, reasonably priced](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Dextromethorphan-Generic-for-Robitussin-Coughgels-Cough-Relief-20-ea-Pack-of-4-/171813862991?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 hash=item2800e77e4f)  (I have no affiliation with the linked seller above, and the link is for legal otc cough medication)   You came and asked for advice about whether it's safe to take in this amount; the overwhelming response is **fuck no**.  Now you're arguing with everyone in the thread who has offered you sound advice.  Why even ask, if you're unwilling to accept that it could be unsafe?   Do you have a citation for that?  It'd be good to know if this is true.   It's likely that most or all of your brain fog is from your cannabis use; you probably can't improve on it much without addressing the cause (either by blocking the inflammation that THC produces in your hippocampus, or by reducing THC exposure).  One approach could be to use a high CBD low THC strain of cannabis, which should be readily available to you if you live in a state with medical cannabis.  CBD inhibits many of the harmful effects of THC (but not all its effects), and has potent anxiolytic effects of its own.   Every writer has their bias - and of course Glenn Greenwald's article has bias.  But it's an insightful editorial, and well worth reading if you've seen the NYT article.   Since you're a daily cannabis user, your best bet is to reduce or cease use of THC.  After that, introducing anti-inflammatory substances that inhibit COX2 or its expression could help, as [COX2 mediated inflammation is how THC fucks your memory](http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2813%2901360-3).  You could use ibuprofen if you want an ulcer, or else use a safer natural antiinflammatory like curcumin etc.  Finally, and especially since you seem to link anxiety with brain fog, you may get great benefit from some kind of mind-training (e.g. mindfulness practice).  Even just a consistent 10 minutes a day can make a big difference in your level of stress and distractability, once you've got into the habit and gained some proficiency.  You could do yoga, qi gong, walking meditation, or another awareness-based physical exercise if you're not interested in sitting down.   Firstly, this is blatant logical idiocy.  Point out the flaw in reasoning.  Otherwise your statement is equivalent to saying "I think you're wrong."  Who cares?      I disagree with this assumption that growth should be maximized.  Too much migration from Reddit could be harmful to the Voat community.   that was awful    In both cases, the members who broke with their caucuses did so in concert with their comparative level of contributions they received from pro-fast track companies.  It contradicts this statement, which is specifically about individuals and not averages.   I would expect it to keep indefinitely if sealed and frozen.  At least long enough for you and I to die of old age.   Haha...liberal reddit and its republican bogeymen.  It was probably true for the Democrats as well, but I was only curious to see my rep's vote (my representative is a Republican and his vote falsified the claim I quoted above).   I don't know.  It seems reasonable to believe that the lower temperature would inhibit growth of molds and bacteria that seem to thrive in cactus tea at refrigerator temperatures even without freezing (which halts all biological activity).  Would this be enough to preserve it?  I don't know.  It might, and it certainly wouldn't hurt.  If the alcohol percentage is high and the solution doesn't separate out into layers, though, it should preserve even at room temperature if sealed.  For example, hard liquors with an alcohol content around 40% keep indefinitely at room temp.   Freeze it immediately - cactus tea is highly perishable, and won't last more than a week or so in the best refrigerator conditions.  It *might* make the brew less palatable once thawed than it would be fresh, but the alternative is far worse - it will mold and sour and turn all kinds of disgusting if not frozen.  The mescaline will be unchanged.  Remember: aqueous solutions expand when frozen.  Choose your container wisely.   Just remember - more is not necessarily better.  You don't want to overdo it with Vitamin D in particular - just take the recommended amount.  For Thiamine, folate, etc - those are just b-vitamins, and you can (and should) get them by taking any common b-vitamin supplement or multivitamin unless a physician tells you otherwise.   Most of the yes votes were provided by Republicans, and the majority of the no votes were from Democrats. In both cases, the members who broke with their caucuses did so in concert with their comparative level of contributions they received from pro-fast track companies.  **Look at the actual data - this claim appears to be false.**  Many "No" votes came from individuals with majority pro-fast track funding according to the actual dataset linked.  E.g. Justin Amash, who voted no but had *only* pro-fast track funding according to their data.  It appears that the article used averages across *all* Republicans voting against the party line and used that to make the very specific conclusion above, which is false in several cases.  Not all representatives voted with their funding.   I guess we disagree about what insulting is.  :/  If you need a state to protect private property, you in turn need a state to protect common property to "protect" the ownership claim in either instance since both require protection from other peoples who will not recognize the claim to the land.  I don't think your conclusion follows.  Anyway, you're not answering my question.  It seems clear enough to me that private property and common property differ substantially, and that a state is necessary to maintain private property if substantial differences in wealth exist.  But a state may not be necessary to maintain common property, because it is common to large numbers of people who have a vested interest in defending their common ownership of it (which most particular instances of private property lack without state intervention).  Do you get what I mean?  So I'd be very interested in reading about a way that private property *can* be maintained without a state, because it seems implausible to me unless it is only on the scale of personal property (e.g. basic means of comfort and survival for individuals, not means of production).  You seem to believe that this possible, so I hope you'll share *why*.   There are a plethora of ideas about the particulars of how a moneyless society might work.  I believe you gave a fair example.  Noam Chomsky, when asked about particulars like this, has often elected to speak about the importance of experimentation and the utter impossibility of anybody predicting the details of such a complex social phenomenon.  That has always made sense to me.  It's important to envision various possible future societies, of course.  But how could you expect to know beforehand?  Human beings are complicated, and much of this is relatively uncharted territory when taken at scale.   Could you offer a genuine refutation or alternative view, instead of just insulting /u/dirtysquatter and expressing strong disagreement?  I don't find anything you said remotely convincing, but am curious to hear a decent counterargument from someone more informed than I am.  How could private property rights and capitalism be maintained without a state?   /u/FrY10cK was probably just looking for a good one-liner, and lacks a basic understanding of how scientific knowledge about drugs is actually made.  Animal research is a necessary tool throughout the entire process of drug development.   Sounds promising; I hope that development can get funded.  A novel ibogaine inspired compound with a stronger safety profile could go a very long way toward mainstreaming psychedelic therapy for addiction!   Look around California some time.  If I didn't know better, I'd expect that the state is tattooing that sign on every baby born in a California birthing center nowadays.  There is lead everywhere: in your body, in the dirt your veggies are grown in, in the veggies, in every supplement you buy, in the air you breath (from car exhaust).  The California legislature is full of idiots and big business cronies.  The warning doesn't mean anything, and isn't evidence based (i.e. it doesn't go on the actual high risk items, but on those that win points for politicians.  They calculate based on serving sizes to skew results across industries).  I buy supplements from companies that will give you a certificate of analysis on request; I check how much lead, mercury, etc is in the supplements I use in large quantity.  I do this because all supplements are from China, and occasionally a cheap supplement will actually have enough lead or something that I don't want it.  But if I don't use a ton of it (e.g. multiple tbsp's a day), I don't bother, because the dose would be small enough that it's comparable to the organic produce I buy at the store anyway.  ...  That starts to look like a rant, but I hope it helps.  TL;DR - don't worry about it unless the dose is really high, in which case you may want to look into the *actual* heavy metal levels in your supplement when you stock up next time.  But I wouldn't worry about it this time around; the amount of lead you could ingest from taking those capsules at the recommended dose is miniscule.  [Here's a web site that actually gives some of the ppb (micrograms / gram) limits that lead to prop 65 labeling.  It doesn't take much lead to get a product labeled.](http://labs.naturalnews.com/What-Do-These-Numbers-Mean.html)   This appears to be an advert from an astaxanthin manufacturers' group.  The view it presents is extremely unbalanced and does not address safety, which is an extremely important concern with novel supplemental carotenoids.   I second this.    Very, very easy to use if you're remotely familiar with C family syntax (e.g. C++, C#, Java, PHP, etc).  If you're not, you can get the basics of C# or JS rolling with a couple weeks of short daily study and prototype your game from there.  Watch and build through their basic tutorials.  Then forget the physics engine, and use the built in pathfinding ("Navigation") to manipulate any moving agents in your world.  You can get point and click unit selection and movement (like in an RTS) going in about 10 minutes if you've watched the tutorial on Navigation and know C#.   That really isn't true.  As others have mentioned, land is quite cheap in many places.  If you have a decent income, little debt, and live frugally (big ifs, I know), you can probably save up and buy some workable land for this kind of project.   This seems disingenuous to me.  Scientific terms - which both sex and gender *are* - usually have a specificity that goes beyond the loose, context-dependent specificity of common language.  For example:  Ribose always has one, specific meaning, no matter where I use it.  If you know what ribose is, and you know the basic language of chemistry, then you know *exactly* what kind of molecule I'm talking about when I mention 2-deoxyribose - even if you've never heard of it before.  It would be counterproductive to have words for specific molecules that are context-dependent.  In fact, where such words exist, they are generally regarded as a nuisance; over time, their use is decreasing.  Context dependent terms for specific molecules would undermine the utility of the chemical language that has been developed, which allows for efficient, expedient, precise communication of chemical ideas.  This is a very special way of using language - it is nothing like the way we converse, really.  Most of our words are used to convey states of emotion and perception - and they necessarily use metaphor, connotation, subtle implication, imagery, and so on.  None of these linguistic constructs have any place in accurate scientific communication (except as human context, e.g. in an introduction or discussion section).  ...  I would argue that as a scientist, you should accept that 'gender' has a specific scientific meaning - not in biology, but in psychology - that is different from 'sex', and the two should therefore not be confused.  This is not a radical view.  This is the dominant view in those fields that *actually use the scientific term 'gender'.*  If you tried to publish a paper that confused the two, at least one of your peer reviewers would demand revision.  If the paper was for a relevant field (e.g. personality psychology), your paper would be rejected - just as surely a paper in cell biology would be rejected if its authors confused DNA for RNA.  It shows that the authors are ignorant of the scientific literature, and have no business writing on the topic.  ...  Now, you might say: look, I'm not talking about scientific communication - I'm talking about using these words in normal conversation.  In that case, it seems that your status as a biologist is entirely irrelevant.  You don't see sex and gender as interchangeable words *as a biologist* - you see them as interchangeable *as an ordinary person*.  But you think this quality of 'being a biologist' somehow stays with you when you engage in ordinary thinking.  It doesn't!  A scientist engaging in non-scientific thinking is no different than a non-scientist engaging in ordinary thinking.  There is nothing scientific about it, and the person's profession is irrelevant.      It's barely watchable.  Great concept, terrible execution...which seems to be about as good as it gets for big films.    The point which you missing is that so called rational science is having a hard time comprehending the things quantum physics tell us.   You seem like a very arrogant person.  You don't know anything about me - not about my status as a current or former user of psychedelics, nor about my views on reality and so on.  But you freely assume all kinds of things and rudely suppose that you are setting me straight about the truth of reality.  Huh.  You say:  The point which you missing is that so called rational science is having a hard time comprehending the things quantum physics tell us.   The problem with this is that *quantum physics is a rational science*.  There is no other *kind* of science.  You seem to think that quantum physics has some existence outside of human experience - it does not.  Quantum physics is a human effort to model reality in a particular way.  It is conceptual.  It is rational.  It is flawed and imperfect.  It is, at best, an accurate *conceptual model* of a very small set of phenomena.  You can't simultaneously reject rationality and accept quantum physics.   Ah, I see what you mean.  I actually enjoyed many parts of Interstellar, which is why I posted.  It was a good concept and a good story in principle, and at times I felt it was well executed.  I agree that accuracy and enjoyability have no necessary relationship in filmmaking, but that really isn't what I was getting at.   It's just that people think you're an asshole, and they're showing you the door.  I don't think this is be a fair assessment of why censorship is used on Reddit.  It *sounds true* because the comic has a very effective delivery.  But there is nothing in the comic that provides any rational basis for *believing* that its claims are true.  It's like a catchy pop song; it sounds true, it sounds important, but it's a trick.  Its content may be true or false, important or frivolous.  You can't tell without further examination than just consuming it.  Given a choice, I'd rather base my beliefs on a reasoned assessment of observable facts.  Reddit seems to use censorship, at the moderator level primarily, but sometimes at the administrative level, primarily to promote views popular in the mainstream semi-intellectual media (which are primarily shaped by the interests of their ownership and their customers, who are advertisers).   Like it or not, reddit is private property. This is not a government run website, your taxpayer dollars are not contributing to this website. As such, reddit is free to do what they want with it.  You seem to think that there is nothing wrong with this, and that that fact is so obvious it requires no support.  Many people believe that the combination of strong private property rights and the concentration of almost all wealth in a tiny elite has problematic implications for society.  Capitalism and private property are not physical properties of reality - they are social institutions.  If you believe they are good, that belief requires justification.  Given their unfortunate consequences for the vast majority of people, I think it would take some incredible evidence to demonstrate that they are good for society or otherwise justifiable.   I don't see how that is relevant to what I wrote.   Fair enough.  You don't have to.  But I think a reasonably impartial viewer of the science-fiction produced in the last few decades *would* admit this.  Incidentally, what I said can be true without the film being any "good".  I thought the characters were, for the most part, utter shit; their life stories and motivations made no sense to me at all.  What the fuck does NASA want with this burned out idiot?  They could build all these ships and run all these facilities, but they can't train one pilot...so they pick up this guy out of nowhere because his appearance feels like synchronicity?  And of course the female lead finds him attractive, in a snarky yet playful way.  Puke.  And then there are the multiple characters who are supposed to be highly accomplished mid-career scientists, who believe that love conquers all and crosses galaxies to deliver information to you about what you should do next in your scientific endeavors.  Bleh!  I honestly wondered whether the film's intended purpose was to brainwash naive science-minded teenagers into believing magical thinking and scientific thinking are somehow compatible and aligned.  So, I don't necessarily think the film didn't suck.  But I do think it made some strong depictions of plausible science fiction in ways that many past science fiction efforts have failed to do.  And I liked the premise, and enjoyed many short passages of the film that I found compelling (and which managed to gloss over gross character and story flaws that plagued most of the film).   Well, it's a good thing I've got you around to set me straight.  There I was, thinking that rationality existed.  But then, flexiverse came and told it like it is, and I've taken the courageous step of dropping these balls off the fence and choosing my side - the irrational side! /s  Flexiverse, you either have not bothered to try to understand what I mean and where I am coming from, or else you are very naive about how the mind and world function.  The scientific conclusion is time doesn't exist and the local effects of space and time are a complete illusion.  That is a very rough interpretation, and one so vague that it could mean many things to many people.  Scientific ideas in physics usually look more like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation#Time-dependent_equation); they are quantitative statements, perhaps wrapped in logic and understanding, but ~~rarely~~ never composed of qualitative language alone.  They relate experience to mathematics.  This is what allows them to be rigorously tested and eventually falsified if they do not adequately model reality.  These things are part of the rational basis of physics, which is a human endeavor to understand reality.  Now, that reality scientists are trying to understand does not have to be rational for it to be advantageous to use rationality to try to understand it.  It doesn't have to conform to our expectations, or behave in a logical sane way, or anything like that - I think the field of quantum mechanics actually supports this point, and undermines yours.  The *phenomena* observed by physicists increasingly contradict our common-sense notions of - even our direct experience of - reality.  So it appears that physicists have undermined any rational support for believing things about the nature reality on the basis of common sense.  That doesn't mean they have undermined support for *using rationality to try to understand reality*, though; it would be a circular argument to claim that they had anyway, as rationality is what got us all these ideas about physics in the first place.  Our understanding now must be convoluted and strange in order to approach an accurate model of reality, but that doesn't mean it has no rational basis...it just means we're using rationality to model something that may be "irrational," if such a term can even be applied to phenomena that arise from outside the human mind.  Einstein said if you truly understood the implications you'd be shocked.   Good!  Einstein encouraged us to use our reason to understand things so unlike our ordinary experience of reality that they are shocking.  Sounds like a great advertisement for the **power of reason**!   You have to admit, the film depicted many things in a reasonably believable way.  There were large parts of the film and central plot devices that you just had to accept despite their impossibility (e.g. the male lead having any appreciable role in action of the film, much less a central one).  But I think it's fair to say that they made a strong effort, and to a great extent succeeded, in delivering plausible science fiction in many situations that have been poorly treated in past works (e.g. relativistic effects of mass on time during exploration of extremely massive planets).   That isn't true at all.  But you don't seem to be interested in a constructive discourse, so I suppose we'll have to remain in disagreement.  :/   It doesn't matter who Allegro was.  You're aggressively demanding that we conform to a method of determining truth that has no rational basis.  Have the balls to pick a side?  Choosing that something is true in the absence of clear evidence, because you believe courage demands it...that is childish at best, and is obviously not a reliable producer of knowledge.    You are being ridiculous.  This kind of thinking has no place in civilized society, nor this subreddit.   Ahh..  I really like the core of the sound, and the way it evolves and moves through different harmonies.  Love that Pink Floyd-esque sound enters around 2:20.  But do I feel strongly that it would be better to reduce the resonance on the sweeping filter to take out the siren-like effect it has.  Because it repeats so quickly, falls in the mid to upper-mid range, and is self-resonating (creates a note at the filter pitch), I found it became annoying very quickly.  If the resonance were reduced, it could become a subtle wave of textures instead of a clear siren tone.  When I use a self-resonating filter in a drone, I either keep the width of any cutoff variation for that filter very small, or I make it highly irregular (e.g. by varying it manually with a knob or mod wheel).  Like in [this](https://soundcloud.com/exuberant_void/1262014bbkje) piece, I use an ARP2600 3 osc broadband drone with a lowpass filter on the edge of self-resonance, and manually vary the cutoff and resonance to create a melodic center for the drone.  Of course, much of this is a matter of taste..   I am planning on engaging in intense cardio and calisthenics everyday up until this urinalysis. I also plan on drinking excessive water and cranberry juice to flush it out of my system.  There's no evidence that either of these things will have an appreciable effect on your body's elimination of methylphenidate and its metabolites.  People often confuse metabolism of energy (i.e. "burning calories") with metabolism of drugs and toxic substances.  The only relationship between these is that they are kinds of regulated chemical reactions performed by your body; their rates can vary independently.  Low body fat makes a difference for substances that are stored in body fat, like THC and its metabolites.  But it doesn't matter for amphetamines.  The longest methylphenidate should be detectable in your urine should be about 4 days.  So...nothing to worry about.  https://www.erowid.org/pharms/methylphenidate/methylphenidate_testing.shtml  http://prescription-drug.addictionblog.org/does-ritalin-show-up-on-a-drug-test/  http://drug.addictionblog.org/how-long-do-amphetamines-stay-in-your-system/  edit: I overstated myself. Cranberry juice might make your urine acidic enough to slightly increase the rate of amphetamine excretion, but the effect is small and requires a lot of juice.  If you were in a crunch it might be worth downing a fuckton of juice on the off-chance that it would put you just under the limit.  But given how much time you have, it really doesn't matter.  	104

 I've moved a few times in recent months (from Massachusetts to Wyoming, now Utah), and I plan on moving a few more times if I don't find a reason to stay in Zion.    It happens to everyone at some point in their dating life.    To be fair, sports are super important in deciding a mate. Yankees suck, yo.    I'm 21, and since moving to a highly religious area where people marry *really* young (compared to what I'm used to), I've kind of thought about having a family in a few years. Wouldn't mind it.

It's really popular and useful!    But sometimes monopolies can't be avoided. In my home town, there's all but one grocery store. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, nor is it anyone's fault, it's just no one else has opened up shop. So that store has a monopoly on my town.    Are you willing to move? Lots of Western states like Utah and Nevada have some pretty healthy job pickings.    One should do their best to avoid working on the Sabbath. Of course, sometimes you just have to, but it isn't good practice. Lots supposed to be a day of rest.    I'm not surprised. ELS has a lot of hateful users who are all sorts of angry.    Probably few people. It's a comic and it's not totally offensive.   Again, humor is subjective. I'm sure satire doesn't even exist in some cultures.    Roses are red  Violets are blue   I'm not good at haiku   Street fights like that happen all the time. Pointing to a single instance of an event isn't evidence of a changing tide. Do you have any other examples that show an increasing trend in confrontation?    I think you're in the minority about being annoyed by this. Humor is subjective, but I don't think many would find this type of comic annoying. Not funny maybe, but not annoying.    And? I'm sure they could do one for every country/civilization of the world, so I don't understand what you're trying to say. That if you make one comic about one group, you have to make a comic about every group?   A little. I hate it when Mongols invade my home country. It's super annoying.   But seriously, what's bad about this? I found it funny.    True, but, an inaugural address is supposed to be a complex layout of policy for the next four years. It's supposed to be a complicated speech. Yet if you watch Obama, Bush, and Clinton, they say three words and the audience roars in applause every minute. It's not valuable and is the dumbing down of politics.    I know people IRL? Oh...   True, cable news might not be the best educational place of learning for anyone, but banning it *would* stop some people from learning about the news. That, and your proposal would probably extend past Fox News, right? I'd imagine you'd have some sort of agency set aside to censor the Internet and media, like China with their Great Firewall. So there'd be a lot more than just shutting off Fox News going on, I'd imagine, which could cause a severe lack to information.  The other issue is you'd be forcing hate speech to underground, where it can't be responded to. I'd rather stand before the KKK in public to counter protest, than force them to meet in hiding where they might become more radicalized (not to say they can't do that now, but banning them from public forms of speech would only increase secret meetings). Plus, I couldn't identify public bigots as easily, and people couldn't respond to their presence or actions.   slavery was well known to be wretched  Depending on the time you around. During the 17th century, very few white Americans were against slavery. Most thought the practice was fine and used the Bible to support the institution. Now of course there's a very important thing to remember here: acts of violence aren't speech. Every decent society bans acts of violence because they tangibly proeduce harm to another, whereas speech does no such thing.  If you think that calling blacks equal to whites is racist towards whites, then you're truly misunderstanding human decency  *I* don't think that, but if I was born two hundred years ago as a white man, I probably would have, and so would you if you were born into the same circumstances. It's hard to imagine, but about two hundred years ago a lot of white men and women were vocally racist and thought that white superiority was just the way things were meant to be. You and I don't agree with that because we were born in a different time, in a different context. What constitutes as "human rights" and "racism" is subject to change. Heck, black Americans were't even considered people until the 3/5ths Compromise (and even then they weren't considered a whole person).   The other reason you and I believe what we do about equality is because speech was allowed to flourish, and wasn't banned by the government. Again, both of us as 19th century white people probably would have been against the notion of total equality for the races (even plenty of abolitionists were against the notion, which you can see in *Bound For Canaan* by Fergus Bordewich). We believe what we believe because people were allowed to speak their minds, even though their thoughts would be considered "ignorant" for their time.        Awesome sauce.    That's contradictory, isn't it? You can't proclaim to be against coddling the ignorant and then turn around and propose ideas which them go ahead and foster ignorance (the lack of knowledge). Banning certain types of speech makes people *more* ignorant, not less. So are you against ignorance, or for it?    The example of proclaiming women as equal to men is not an indecent thing, it is not lynching of black men; it is not letting poor people starve; it is not stealing form the poor to give to the rich; it is not allowing bankruptcy and death if you can not afford health care.   Right, but my point is opinions change, which is why censorship is bad. If you tried proclaiming black men were the equal counter parts of whites in the 19th century, most folks would call your opinion ignorant, racist (against the white man), and just plain *crazy*. Under the conditions you're against (racism, ignorance, hatred), such vocal opinions probably would have been banned because it was a different context of thought, and your thoughts would be dangerous and evil.   Sure, you might say of course that opinion isn't evil or wrong, but you can only say that in hindsight two hundred years later. What's not indecent to you now probably would have been wretched to you a century or two ago.    I recommend *Unlearning Liberty* be Greg Lukianoff for some great thoughts on banning speech.    Sometimes folks like sharing their opinions, no matter what, especially if they have a vested interest in the matter (whatever it may be). It's very easy to interject in any conversation on the Internet, as compared to real spaces where people physically gather.    Do folks *not* have the right to an opinion? If that's the case, that sounds like a desire for blatant censorship, which is one way to encourage ignorance in the masses. Plus, what constitutes as insane changes from time to time. If you proclaimed that woman were just as equal as men nearly a century ago, your opinion would have been considered far out there, and you may have been considered crazy.   (sorry if I misunderstood)   It's happening everywhere. If you look at the data, to understand Thomas Jefferson's inaugural address you'd need about a college level education. To understand Obama's? About a 5th grade level.   And when you look at the State of the Union addresses, for every minute of speech there's about a thirty seconds worth of applause.   In other words, nothing of value is being said any more.

I am indeed a Quaker, but I attend LDS services as I live in Provo (the heart of Mormonism), and don't mind attending my local ward as there's a lot to learn there (compared to sitting in silence with Friends for two hours).

Japan has had a lot of Prime Ministers over the past few years because they resign constantly.    Surrender.    Okay, dad.    21 year old Bostonian living in Utah, currently working for the Red Cross.   For my historiography class, I chose to do research on Nixon's visit to China after watching an opera on TV called "Nixon In China". Since then, I've been fascinated by Sino-US relations, and beyond that, everything China does in the game of international politics.   On a side note, one of the coolest things I ever got to see was the China exhibit at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in California. There were a lot of cool things on display there.    Albert Camus' *The Fall*. It'd be way too hard.   I liked *The Essence of Shinto: Japan's Spiritual Heart* by Motohisa Yamakage. Very easy read, very informative.   I read *The Last Town on Earth* by Thomas Mullen while it was raining for a week straight. Fit the mood well.    [Like this](http://static.caloriecount.about.com/images/medium/oscar-mayer-hot-dogs-60464.jpg)   I'll read the news or watch local access programming.     Do only what is honest. If you feel like you can accept the things she (and other Christians) teach you, then go forward. But if you can not, let that be known.

 I honestly feel bad now. I feel like I did a terrible job of explaining the findings and sharing my thoughts and I don't know how to fix it.    Yes. Thank you. This is pretty much what I said.    Glucokinase is an enzyme involved in carbohydrate metabolism (the 'transformation' of ingested carbohydrates for energy, a.k.a Adenone triphosphate (ATP)).  Oxidative phosphorylization is a biochemical process by which an enzyme (in this case, glucokinase) will use the transfer of electrons (in this case, an oxidation, meaning a loss of electrons ) caused by the transport of nutrients in order to produce ATP in the mitochondria of cells. This is the basis of how we, humans, are able to live: the nutrients we ingest undergo various chemical transformations, resulting in a 'chain' of electron transfers of which the end product is ATP.  The net hepatic glucose uptake rate is simply the rate at which the liver transforms glucose which comes from ingested macro nutrients in order to produce ATP. In this study, they found that when the dogs are on a caloric surplus, the liver becomes less efficient at doing this, thus resulting in a decrease in the net uptake rate of glucose 'transformation' in the liver.    I'm trying my damn hardest to explain this simply. Hopefully it makes more sense now? Please let me know!      At the end of the day, only the caloric balance really matters, for the average, mostly sedentary person anyway.    Well, if you ask me, most people don't care about either one. They don't care about their metabolism being all messed up, and they don't care about being overweight as a result, either. Blatant generalization here, but I think there's something messed up with society. People don't even know what goes through their intestinal tract on a daily basis...    I realize now that there was a simpler of explaining everything I said. I'm sorry. I spent a lot of time studying this stuff in my short lifetime, so talking about things like ATP synthesis and macro nutrients feels very natural to me. But I'm perfectly aware that it's not the case for everyone. I'm tired and didn't think too much and forgot about who I was addressing myself to.    Lol how am I being rude here? Just because there isn't an emote in there doesn't mean I have a rude expression on my face as I'm typing. I genuinely thought people would understand what I was saying.    My assumption was that people generally understand at least the basic biochemical principles behind nutritional science. Guess I was wrong...    Well, I can explain why, but not simply. There's a correlation between a  decrease in the net hepatic glucose uptake rate and an increase in the adipose tissue uptake rate of triglycerides and in an excess nutrient-induced hepatic accumulation of lipids. Nutrients that cannot be used for ATP synthesis are transformed into triglycerides, which are ultimately stored in the body's fat tissue. There's also evidence that there is a link between overeating, the process of de novo fatty acid synthesis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.    Actually, it's quite common practice for athletes   people concerned with their physical appearance to purposely be at a positive energy balance in order to improve performance. For example, bodybuilders increase the amount of muscular tissue in their body with a combination of resistance training and overeating.    The liver is less efficient at metabolizing glucose for ATP synthesis. The glucose from nutrients in your body is transformed into energy at a lesser rate. I can't think of a way to explain it more simply.    Based on this study alone, it's obviously not possible to assess whether the negative impact of continuously having a positive energy balance over a relatively long period of time is outweighed by the benefits associated with various levels of physical activity. That question cannot be answered, at least not within the scope of this single study.    Adiposity isn't discussed here. Their findings simply state that the net hepatic glucose uptake rate is affected by continuously having a positive energy balance over a relatively long period of time (in this case, 4 weeks).    Nope, you simply need to avoid ending the day with a positive energy balance.    For those who are too lazy to read the whole thing: simply put, they found that being at a positive energy balance, regardless of macro nutrient breakdown, negatively affects the body's ability to process glucose in the liver; the higher caloric intake is, the more the ability of the glucokinase enzyme to phosphorylate glucose is reduced. Because of this, over time, the net hepatic glucose uptake rate (NHGU in the study) is negatively affected, thus resulting in excess nutrient-induced hepatic accumulation.   Simply put, they found that being at a positive energy balance, regardless of macro nutrient breakdown, negatively affects the body's ability to process glucose in the liver; the higher caloric intake is, the more the ability of the glucokinase enzyme to phosphorylate glucose is reduced. Because of this, over time, the net hepatic glucose uptake rate (NHGU in the study) is negatively affected, thus resulting in excess nutrient-induced hepatic accumulation.                  LPL then LCK then the rest of the world.    The tilt.    Faker goes Irelia mid. Roccat's mid laner goes Irelia mid.  Clearlove starts playing Evelynn. Every single jungler in NA   EU LCS starts playing Evelynn.  LCK's top laners start playing Ryze. EU top laners start playing Ryze.   I mean, really?  Western players pls   I would argue that this is because, at the highest level, absolute strength overpowers relative strength. And in a world where absolute strength is what matters, the bigger guy is obviously going to do better. Of course there are other factors, but if we're about strength specifically, that's what I think.                      I've joined. I'm currently at 180 lb, 12-13% body fat. I want to drop another 5 pounds to get to 10% body fat and then I'll start gaining mass while maintaining body fat as much as possible until I reach my endgoal of 200 lb and 10% body fat!   To quote the article:  'Furthermore, studies in humans confirm that fructose, but not glucose (when provided as 25% of energy requirements), in the context of an energy-balanced diet increases de novo lipogenesis and visceral adiposity along with dyslipidemia, decreases insulin sensitivity10, 12 and decreases in fat oxidation53. Curiously, in human studies that use isocaloric diets with subjects in energy balance (i.e., equal energy intake and expenditure), observed no overall effects of fructose in BW gain20, 21. However, it is worth mentioning that such interventions in humans tend to be of very short duration (up to 4 weeks), so it is not clear whether such null effects on BW will persist in longer term interventions.'  Sadly, there is no clear answer.                   Good article.  Personally, when I'm on a low/no carb diet, I simply add some salt to all of my meals, and that does just fine.  For Potassium and Magnesium, I take them in tablet form.    On the contrary, it has made my life SO much healthier!    That's why you make things that can be kept for a while in your fridge or freezer. Meat, rice, oatmeal, vegetables, fruits, cottage cheese, etc..    Sandwiches no, but I do eat a lot of lettuce. I don't see your point though. Care to elaborate?       The short answer is, in the long run, yes it does.    Or, even better, buy and prepare your meals for the entire week all in the same day, for example, on Sunday. And nothing else. This way, you cannot be tempted to eat anything else than what you're supposed to! :)   This is something that took me a long time to learn, and that I've learned the hard way.   Do not hype up your meals, do not look forward to them. Do not build your day around your dinner meal, or your week around your Saturday diet. Because you're always going to end up disappointed if you think of food this way. And the size doesn't matter either... Whether it be a 200 calorie chocolate pancake, a 350 calorie piece of chocolate cake, or a 2700 calorie extra large meat lover pizza, it's all the same.    Any meal is going to take, at most, 20 minute to eat, and then what? Your life continues, and it hasn't been made better by that meal. Eating that meal hasn't contributed to your *overall happiness* in any way. And as you realize that, it creates a vicious circle of frustration and despair, because you keep looking forward to something that continuously fails to make you feel happy in the long run.  There was a time when, like a lot of people, I used to rely on food for happiness. And it took me a long time to realize that food is really just that - food - and nothing else, and that it serves no inherent purpose other than allowing my body to function properly so I can survive (and gaining muscle mass and strength). And when I realized that, I started looking for other ways of creating satisfaction in my life, and the day I finally managed to do so, food became meaningless. All I see now is proteins, carbohydrates, fats and micro nutrients, and it doesn't really matter where I get these four things as long as I do get them.   And I can easily eat the same thing everyday, because taste means nothing to me. Because, like I said, food means nothing to me. Because I eat to survive, and not to reward myself or in response to an outside factor, such as stress, sadness or boredom, or the desire to socialize.  For me at least, the day I started looking at food as nothing other than macro nutrients that I need in order to survive, I felt an immense weight fall of my shoulders and I became a much happier and healthier person. And it took me years, and there was a lot of mental pain, but it was well worth it.   I am no longer a slave of my own everyday wants, and now that the desire to eat now longer makes me short sighted, I can gaze far into the future and see the kind of person that I want to become and work toward becoming that person.    I'm aware that it provides very little to no benefits body composition wise. I'm just curious what it would be like from a psychological perspective.    If you want to drop a lot of water weight... Just stop eating sodium, reduce your water intake, and switch to a low carbohydrate diet. It's much safer for your health than using a laxative drug. Also, just so you know, you will look leaner and be lighter on the scale, but you won't be losing fat faster. Being on a bigger caloric deficit will make you lose weight faster, that's it.    80% of your calories should be burned from diet IMO, so the exercise you do shouldn't account for many calories.    Just curious if anyone here does this. I have a bodybuilder friend who does - He wakes up at 8 am, doesn't eat for the entire day, hits the gym at 5 pm, eats a ridiculously huge 3000 calorie meal right after, then fasts for the remainder of the day. He does this everyday. I've been tempted to try this, just for fun.    There's no way around it. You just gotta power your way through it.    For weight loss, it makes little difference. But if you wanna perform in the gym and while doing exercise in general, you need to eat lots of low GI carbohydrate foods.    In a controlled lab setting, the benefits of losing weight by eating less far outweigh all other factors when it comes to overall health, even exercise. If you are exercising daily but still fat because of your diet, you are literally less healthy than someone who is living a couch potato life but losing weight through diet.    Eating 'healthy' only makes a difference insofar as it allows you to be at a caloric deficit, never forget that.    Nice man! Happy that you found something that works for you! Don't forget though, diet is the most important thing, not cardio, for weight loss!   Society has been trying to teach us to exercise and eat 'healthier', but what does it even mean to eat 'healthy'? The truth is, exercising and eating 'healthy' only matter only matter insofar as they allow you to be at a caloric deficit.    Even though my parents never had eating habits that were that good, they weren't fat when I was a kid. However, I was: I became overweight by the age of 11 and was in that state until I was 15, when I started exercising and learning about nutrition and counting calories. It took me 5 years to drop down to 12-13% body fat, and the whole process of becoming fat and then losing all the weight had a huge impact on the person I became, positively and negatively.  But I never blamed my parents, because they never knew better. Nonetheless, what goes around comes around I guess, since as they became older they also became overweight. But instead of blaming them, I decided to help them lose their weight. My dad has been more reluctant to change his habits, and he drinks way too much alcohol (you shouldn't drink alcohol period, in my opinion).   On the other hand, my mom agreed to go on a strict diet and start weight lifting about 6 months ago, and as of today she has lost 35 pounds. She didn't want me to post pictures, but she went from 155 pounds and about 40% body fat to 120 pounds and close to 25% body fat, and she feels great.  I don't have any siblings, so for me it's important that my parents live long and healthy lives despite their lack of knowledge, and I'm working hard on it. Now I need to get on my dad's case, and I can already tell it's gonna be one hell of a ride, but I'm staying positive!!      My motivations are the years I've spent in school and in a lab studying chemistry, biology and then biochemistry and human nutrition, and which have opened my eyes on how messed up society truly is when it comes to eating behaviors and in general.   Also, I was traumatized by my childhood due to being overweight as a kid.  As a result of these two things, I'm obsessed with physical appearance (I want to keep getting increasingly lean and muscular), I have somewhat of an inferiority complex, and I tend to look down on ignorance (bad habit, but at least I'm aware of it). Those were my initial reasons for completing my weight loss. Now that it's completed (I'm at 12% body fat), nothing has really changed.    For me, there is carbohydrates and fats, and then there's proteins.  When you're on a caloric surplus, excess fat is directly stored, while carbohydrates indirectly increase adipose tissue uptake of triglycerides, since they are the body's preferred source of the energy.  On the other hand, even though the conversion pathway exists theoretically (for example via gluconeogenesis), some studies have found that dietary proteins never actually increase fat storage, even on a fairly large caloric surplus.     Weight is such a superficial thing... You can take a big shit in the morning and there you go, you've dropped 2 pounds. I'm not kidding, this has happened to me before. Does that mean I've actually lost 2 pounds worth of stored fat? No, not at all. I'm losing weight because I'm on a caloric deficit, that's it.   Body fat percentage is an accurate measure of progress, but sadly it can only be measured accurately in a lab with expensive equipment. So the only reliable we, laypeople, have of measuring our progress is by looking at ourselves in the mirror.    This is why you don't look at the scale. Daily fluctuations in weight and actual body fat percentage are two very, very different thing. Personally I look at myself in the mirror every morning, but I rarely look at the scale.    I don't use any app or program, but I've been tracking calories for almost a decade now and so I know the caloric content of various portions of almost all foods by heart, and I also have my own list that I made myself and that I check occasionally. It's an habit that I will have all my life, that I have taught to my own parents to help them lose weight, and that I will teach to my future children as well.   Caloric intake is by far the most important factor when it comes to nutrition, so counting calories is not a habit that should ever be given up in my opinion.    I do my cardio in the morning before breakfast, but that's because my bodyfat is low and I'm trying to get rid of the stubborn fat. In general, you can do your cardio anytime, in the long run it doesn't really make a difference.    Congrats, but you could have probably lost more efficiently still if you had tracked caloric intake. However, you still lost a number of pounds that you seem to be satisfied with, so hats off to you.    First, congrats on your progress, and for ending that unhealthy relationship.  Second, I know where you're coming from. I had to choose between a relationship and the fit life... and I chose the latter without hesitation. I study full time during the week, work full time during the weekend, I spend an hour preparing food and 2-3 hours working out everyday. The rest of the time is for moving from one place to another and, most importantly, sleeping. It's a time consuming schedule, but it's definitely worth it.  Who needs a relationship when you've got an amazing body?!   Anyway, congrats man, stay hungry for progress!   I've repeated this so many times it makes my head hurts... There's no such thing as a plateau when it comes to weight loss. The body never becomes significantly less efficient at using stored fat for energy. In order to lose weight, you need to eat less, it's that simple. If you're not losing weight, you're either miscalculating how much you're eating or eating too much or both.    In all cases, I'm sorry I was rude. The thing I hope you get out of this is that there's no such thing as a plateau when it comes to weight loss. If you're not losing weight, you need to eat less, it's really that simple. Personally, I don't really rely on TDEE calculators because I don't think they're very accurate. I usually use the TDEE formula as a starting point, and then either increase or decrease my daily calories on a weekly basis until I get to the desired outcome.    I lost my cool, but I was never upset at you personally. Just at the general ignorance that I keep coming across on the internet and throughout society at large. Even the people over at popular websites like bodybuilding.com have no idea what they're saying half the time, it's infuriating. Myths like this spread like wildfire and it's not your fault for believing them.    You don't need to cheat when your meals are healthy, tasty and satisfying to eat. If you feel the need to have cheat meals regularly, something about your diet needs to change IMO.    Well, I've had a long day and I come here and first thing I see is the OP getting upvoted for spreading senseless bullshit. Of course I'm a little pissed and my tone did reflect that. I'm sorry.    And now I'm getting massively downvoted by people who are equally clueless as the OP. Ok. No point arguing, I see. I will simply leave this thread.    Awesome progress! Congratulations man!    Of course you don't think it's true, you don't understand the basic biochemical principles behind nutritional science... One of the only things that can directly affect one's ability to release triglycerides as free fatty acids and use them for energy production is fluctuations in circulating serum levels of the leptin adipokine hormone, and the impact is minimal in the overweight, who have a relatively large supply at all times due to having a large number of fat cells. The reason why your weight dropped so quickly, most likely, is because you quickly reduced your caloric and carbohydrate intakes, causing your reserves of muscle   liver glycogen to deplete quickly and making you lose a lot of the water stored in your body as well in the process. And before that, you were most likely just eating too many calories and/or miscalculating how much you were eating for your level of activity.  You can think of all the excuses and reasons in the world, but at the end of the day, if you are at daily negative energy balance, you will lose fat. It's plain and simple. Given a consistent level of activity, your body does not suddenly start utilizing the nutrients that you eat less efficiently. The body doesn't work like that.   Also, that bodybuilding.com article is very ignorant... Refeed days do not equal 'cheating'. It's well established that only carbohydrate intake has a significant impact on leptin levels, and not fats or proteins.   Edit:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10567012  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11126336  http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v60/n1/abs/1602270a.html  As you can see, many research teams have shown that the link between leptin and calories is primarily in regards to carbohydrates. Whoever wrote that article on bodybuilding is clueless, just like people who believe that the process of utilizing the body's reserves of triglycerides for ATP synthesis can 'plateau'. Downvote me all you want for being a rude ass, but too many people believe this myth and it's infuriating.      I applaud you for your dedication! Keep it up my friend! Stay hungry!   There is no such thing as a plateau when it comes to weight loss. Drop your caloric intake, make sure your training intensity remains the same, make sure your calorie tracking is accurate, etc.    Full body resistance training with a focus on back muscles and with some cardio at the end. Barbell regular deadlifts, barbell straight leg deadlifts, weighted pullups, barbell back rows, dumbbell shrugs, bicep curls, and with 40 min of either Stairmaster or elleptical machine at the end, haven't decided yet.    I feel you. My caloric intake hasn't changed, but I went back to a low carb diet after being on an isocaloric one didn't work so well. Eating more carbs tends to make it harder for me to deal with hunger, not sure why, but it made the last couple days harder to endure food wise. Glad to be back on my regular eating patterns now. :)    Goals are to respect my target caloric intake for the day and get in a good workout tonight. That's it!   Yep. The best revenge in life is proving others that they were wrong when they said you couldn't do anything.    You make a lot of assumptions. I haven't used it yet, and just because I'm discussing the subject or asking questions does not mean I ever will. I know that it's one of the few compounds that are causatively linked to death. I know that the dose that can be dangerous enough to make you end up in the ICU or die varies between individuals and is somewhat unpredictable. I'm perfectly aware that it's objectively dangerous. Thanks for your concern though, but I'm a bit offended by your assumption that I'm just an idiot with a strong cognitive bias.    I'm not saying that you're wrong to live the way you do, on the contrary. I can easily see how my outlook on the world can be regarded as 'extreme' by a lot of people, and in fact on the internet it is, and in real life I keep my views a secret from my friends and family. All they know is that I work out a lot and eat healthy, they don't know that I look down on them for their living habits. My views have been shaped by the traumatic childhood I've had due to being overweight as a child and teenager, as well as by the years I've spent in a lab studying and conducting experiments (I'm a Biochemistry major with a minor in Human Nutrition), and like you correctly guessed, I've definitely had to sacrifice a lot socially in order to continue to live by my own ideals.   Do I think everyone should live by those ideals? Yes, to a certain extent. But that does not mean that I try to force them on others or that I am unable to understand where they come from. After all, we all have our own beliefs which are based on our life experiences and upbringing. I blame society for the flaws I see in how individuals live, not the individuals themselves.    How so? I merely expressed my opinion respectfully while acknowledging his.    I agree with your point, but it doesn't have to do with age (I'm 21). The way I see it is, you are getting pressured by your family members who obviously don't share your understanding and sensibility to the scientific principles behind nutrition. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it's just how things are. Most of society is ignorant when it comes to food and, I might come off as arrogant by saying that, in general as well, I would say. And those of us who aren't suffer from that because of our peers and family.    It's not a matter of self control. You don't need an absence of social contact to binge eat. A lot of people are more likely to binge eat when they're bored and alone at home. It's a question of principle for me. I strive to live by ideas and ideals, and not by my everyday wants. That's why I don't have 'cheat meals' or anything like that. It's not just about weight loss.    I respect your effort, but personally I do not eat out at restaurants because I cannot count how many calories I'm eating or control the nutritional content of the food. Also, in my opinion, eating as a mean of socializing is an extremely unhealthy and unnecessary cultural practice that promotes unhealthy eating habits, overeating and binge drinking of alcohol.    It's a bad idea when have no clue how to eat/have unhealthy eating habits. It's a good shortcut if you can adapt your diet accordingly.    Yes, I'm already well aware that the main adverse effect of DNP misuse/overuse is an acute risk of death. That's because mitochondria uncoupling, the main mechanism by which it causes fat cell breakdown, has been poorly studied and so there's no medication or short term medical protocol to counter its adverse effects yet. So, if you take too much and get potentially fatal hyperthermia, your best bet is to get into a cold bath and call the paramedics so they can watch you die. Sad but true.  With that said, I believe that DNP is currently by far the most effective compound that exists for weight loss, and that it can be used relatively safely if you know what you are doing. A testament to that is that the compound is being actively studied currently, in hope that in the future the associated weight loss physiological mechanism (mitochondria uncoupling) can be used to produce drugs that are just as effective but safer for weight loss for the average layperson who is ignorant to science.   I have done a lot of research on the compound, but have yet to use it on my own body, so I'm curious and would like to get some anecdotal evidence from people who have. Thanks in advance to those who will answer.  -What typically reported/advised dose did you use?  -Which of the typically reported adverse effects did you get?  -If you did get the allergic reaction that some people seem to get, which anti-histamine drug did you use, and what dose? How long did it take for the reaction to go away once you started medicating?  -If you had access to blood testing, how were your Triiodothyronine levels during and post cycle? I'm especially curious about this one, because I've seen that a lot of the more recent online protocols have a 'post-cycle phase' of which the goal is to replenish T3 levels primarily via nutrition, but I've never seen the scientific evidence that it significantly does reduce them, even though in theory I can see why it does.   -How hard was it to adjust your TDEE to your new weight post cycle?  -What supplements did you use? I've read some opinions that you should supplement with Pyruvate in tablet or capsule form daily to prevent a possible allergic reaction, but again, I've never seen the evidence.    I never eat to celebrate. In my opinion, this cultural practice is one of the underlying causes of the increasing rates of obesity in society. People eat unhealthy snacks at parties, eat in fast food restaurants to hang out with their friends, eat 'comforting foods' at funerals... People eat as a mean of socializing all the time, and most of the time that's when they eat greasy and sugar rich foods and that's when they end up being at a caloric surplus. This is irrational, you don't need to ingest macro nutrients in order to be able to socialize with other human beings. I don't know why our society does that, but it's not normal. Humans didn't evolve to have access to such an abundant supply of food, and the human brain isn't made to eat such rewarding foods all the time like we are doing today. People in today's world have never been taught to make the difference between eating because of actual hunger and eating because of exogenous factors, such as boredom, stress or the desire to socialize....   This is only anecdotal evidence but: I work at my university's faculty lab and we are currently studying how the desire to socialize affects food intake and food consumption patterns in healthy and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rodent (naked mole-rat) subjects. And based on preliminary experiments, I can tell you that there's a great chance that we are going to find that socialization has drastic effects on how eusocial beings interact with foods.       Congratulations, and indeed there are no shortcuts! The hardest isn't to diet or train, it's to continue to do these things even when you're lacking motivation and feeling down! If you can do this consistently, you take it one step further and differentiate yourself from average!!    Exercise does allow you to eat a bit more though. Actually, it requires you to eat more unless you want a greater deficit. The issue is that it causes a lot of people to think that it allows them to eat a lot more than it actually does, which sometimes explains why people do not lose weight despite exercising and eating 'healthy' regularly.    Good luck! And remember, the hardest is not dieting or training. It's continuing to do these things even when you're lacking motivation and feeling down. This is what differentiates the great and successful from everyone else in the long run.    Yeah, I understand. You can only do both at the same time when you start. Proper dieting and being at a caloric deficit will make you lose weight while you put on mass and strength naturally. Eventually, though, you will start having to do one at a time. But that doesn't matter for now.    Thinking that you don't want to become too 'bulky' is the worst mindset to start with. Look, you will never become insanely muscular except with years and years of hard training, on point dieting and use of various muscle building drugs. Lifting heavy weights and eating healthy consistently for a couple months will never even make you close to being overly muscular like you seem to be irrationally afraid of becoming.    There is some evidence in the scientific literature that it does, literally. Your food choices influence your gut microbiota composition, and in turn those microorganisms influence which nutrient and nutrient choices your brain wants via something known as the gut-brain axis. As you make 'healthier' food choices, the composition of your gut microbiota changes and the micro organisms that prefer the nutrients associated with 'unhealthy' foods get progressively replaced by the 'healthier' food ones.    It's not dangerous enough to be controlled. It's available over the counter in pharmacies and in most supplement/fitness stores, at least where I live. Although this is only anecdotal evidence, I have personally been using Ephedrine for many years now, and I've never had any problems. The appetite suppressing effects work very well, and they only stop working after 3-4 months of continuous use... At which point you can simply cease use completely for 1-2 months and then resume, without any issues. Like I said, only my experience though.    In my experience, the snacking issue was because main meals weren't filling/satisfying enough. Both extremes exist... Some people eat a single enormous meal and then fast for the rest of the day, others eat as many as 8-10 small even portions throughout the day. I find that the best to avoid snacking and overeating is somewhere in the middle, 3 to 5 fairly sized meals with 3 to 5 hours in between each. Starchy vegetables should help contain hunger as well.    I would avoid doing that. That adds a lot of calories for no reason.    As long as the foods you eat are healthy, there's nothing wrong with that. Why change a working formula?    Make sure your calorie tracking is accurate, reduce your caloric intake a bit, increase your exercise level a bit, eat foods that are more filling, etc.. It's really simple. If nothing's changing, change things up, work harder, but most importantly, never give up.    I'm not a doctor, but I would suggest using something that suppresses appetite, such as a sympathomimetic drug. Ephedrine is great for that. It's cheap, widely available both over the counter and on the internet, and when combined with caffeine it's a mild stimulant that suppresses appetite and with little to no side effects.   I have for a lot of respect for people who are unhealthy but making a huge effort to change and acquire a healthy body. Not all of us were lucky to be born in an environment that promotes health.  Hats off to you good sir.   If you keep the diet that has allowed you to maintain your current weight, nothing should change. There is no drug that directly increases fat storage.    Any form of sugar is fine. If you wanna keep it healthy, I would go for foods that are also packed with proteins and micro nutrients, such as milk, fruits. White rice is also pretty good since it fills up and is rather fast digesting.    Crust was made extra thin with flaxseed flour  1/2 cup low calorie tomato sauce  1 cup low fat mozzarella cheese  30 slices of lean ground turkey meat  1 medium size green pepper  1 medium size onion  Tasty AND healthy! Only 700 calories for the entire pizza, with an isocaloric breakdown: about 35% carbohydrates, 35% fats and 30% proteins.     I don't understand how your shopping card looks 'boring'. Everything looks delicious and filling to me. Lean meat. Starchy vegetables. Some delicious fiber rich fruits. This shopping cart is nearly perfect, the only thing it's missing in my opinion is some kind of cereal grain, like natural oats, quinoa or hemp seeds.    The pleasure is mine! And I would also like to add that, while I think that sugar is horrible for the average sedentary person, it's actually really useful for high endurance sports athletes, such as marathon runners. However, if you do no physical exercise and always eat a caloric surplus, it's horribly unhealthy because it creates a greater insulin response and therefore increase the transport of nutrients into fat tissue. Over time, it's one of the main reasons people become insulin resistant, obese and less capable of resisting to hunger.    Exactly. For me, it all ended when I realized that fulfilling my food cravings would never make me happy. Sure, I can have that bowl of ice cream and I'll be happy for 10 min and then what? My life isn't better. I'm not feeling better. If anything, my life is now worse because I have 500 calories less to work with for the remainder of the day and I'm hungry because ice cream doesn't fill me up for more than 30 min.    Yes, but it's not just a 'fad'. There is scientific evidence behind consuming sugar being a good thing after an intense physical effort, as I just explained. I would argue that chocolate milk is a reasonably healthy source of sugar, because it also has a decent number of proteins and is rich in certain micro nutrients. There might be better, but for a post-exercise meal specifically it's definitely not a bad choice.    I weight myself everyday simply to check whether I need to drop my water intake or not.       Congratulations!    There is something that occurs following an intense physical effort and that is known as the post-exercise insulin sensitivity effect. Following your workout, glucose coming from the bloodstream is broken apart for energy at a faster than normal rate, and you become more sensitive to insulin produced to transport nutrients, meaning more of these nutrients get used up than usual. The reasons for this are complex, but have partly to do with the insulin signalling neural pathway: functioning proteins known as atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1) increase the translocation (genetic 'rearrangement') rate of another functioning protein known as Glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), thus causing its sarcolemmal (cellular) content to increase. GLUT4 is insulin-regulated and its purpose is essentially to increase nutrient uptake into fat tissue and muscles.  For these reasons, it's better to have a high glycemic load carbohydrate meal following a workout.    The other comments are not giving you the accurate picture... The research on meal timing is still ongoing and new discoveries are being made. However, the importance of the previous findings has been overstated by fitness enthusiasts... For the average overweight person trying to get down to a normal BMI, it probably makes little difference.    A pound of fat is 3500 calories. If you want to lose 2 pounds a week, you need to be on a 1000 daily caloric deficit. Basic maths. At your body fat percentage, you can do it without losing muscle mass or any other health issues, BUT you need to make sure that you're eating a lot of starchy vegetables and other fiber   micro nutrient packed foods to ensure a) that your basic physiological processes (such as digestion) keep functioning properly  and b) that you don't start getting insane cravings for certain foods partly due to hunger and which would surely compromise your weight loss goals.  A 500 caloric deficit is more sustainable for most people but there's certainly nothing wrong with being at 1000 unless you have a low body fat (around 20% and below for women). Whatever deficit number you shoot for, make sure you stick to that number. Consistency is key. You can't start at 1000 calories and then, 2 weeks in, tell yourself 'I can't do it I'm gonna cut back to 500'. That's a slippery slope and by going down that slope you're setting yourself up for failure, in my opinion at least. If you go for 1000 calories a day, it's 1000 calories all the way until you've reached your goal.    Either your body fat percentage is relatively high and you went on a relatively high caloric deficit, or you lost a lot of water weight.    'Jumping rope may be popular with kids, but this girlie activity is one of the most effective ways to burn fat and improve cardiovascular health.'  I stopped reading right there. The most effective way to burn fat and improve cardiovascular health is actually sustaineing a well-balanced diet that puts you at a daily caloric deficit. Whoever wrote this has no obviously no idea what they're talking about...  Also, any form of physical exercise that involves using various parts of your body in coordination/all at the same time will make you burn calories. Hiking, running, parkouring, weight lifting... It's all the same. I don't see any reason that justifies calling the jumping rope exercise a superior option. If you can't do that exercise properly, just do something else. It makes no difference.     'Juince cleanses' and other myths of the kind are based on the horribly ignorant idea that your body needs outside help or some kind of 'kick start' to change. No... just no. The human physiology is well made. Your gastrointestinal tract and gut microbiota will adapt and change along with your diet over time.   Also, no diet of the kind would produce any improvement in fatty acid utilization to a greater extent than simply being at a caloric deficit would... Most likely, if you experience any drastic changes in weight, it's because your muscle glycogen stores become depleted,  thus causing a lot of water to leave your body in the process, and nothing else.  And even if you do actually lose weight, you'll most likely gain it immediately as you get right back to your old dieting habits once the 'cleanse' is over. Again, sounds like a good plan for failure and ensuring that you lose all motivation to maintain healthy life changes in the long run.    Instead of trying to work with uneducated idiocies of the kind, I would shoot for making a reasonably healthier diet plan that is based on a well-balanced diet of proteins, carbohydrates and fats, that puts you at a caloric deficit, and, most importantly, that you will be able to maintain in the long run. This is the only 100% safe and fool proof way to lose weight in a sustained manner... Anything else is either a marketing plot that takes advantage of the masses' ignorance, or a dangerous shortcut with some significant side effects (in this case it's the former).    Chicken wings aren't acceptable in any form whatsoever in my opinion. You could eat literally anything else that's white meat without the skin (which is just bad fats and carbohydrates) and it would be better. The solution isn't helping her with the cravings, it's finding ways of helping her get rid of the cravings altogether.    This is why I don't smoke weed anymore. It makes me too hungry, which isn't appropriate when I'm in weight loss mode. I prefer psilocybin. It's not toxic like ethanol and doesn't increase appetite like THC.    I can't creep my ex partner, because I've never had a partner to begin with.    As a cynical person, I was never interested in making money to begin with. The things that I am chasing in life are not things that can be purchased. No sum of material currency can buy dedication, willpower, consistent hard work or the ability to keep an open mind and continuously explore new possibilities throughout one's life.    Yep. I have to admit, to me, seeing my body change has become an addiction... At first I wanted to change my body to be healthier, now I'm changing it to become increasingly lean and muscular, no matter the cost. It is the best thing I have experienced in my entire life, and I have tried a lot of things, including many drugs. No drug was ever as gratifying as keeping track of my caloric intake and dieting and seeing my body fat go down or my muscular mass go up as a result.       I'm asking scholars if they actually think that laypeople are stupid, yes.    I mean ignorant in a pejorative sense.      Spaghetti doesn't have to be a cheat meal. Take a low calorie sauce, add in some lean meat for proteins and fats, and there you go, you have a balanced meal of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. All you have to do now is take a portion that works with your target caloric intake!   Nothing beats a proper diet for general health and changing your body. And the drugs that are actually powerful to do so are also the ones that can potentially be extremely dangerous if not used carefully and should therefore not be available to the masses. 2,4-Dinitrophenol comes to mind as a good example; it will cause substantial fat loss even on an isocaloric maintenance diet, but the side effect of misuse/overdose is: an acute risk of death. Otherwise, most legal drugs marketed by supplement companies as 'weight loss aids' have never been shown to work in rigorously conducted lab experiments... In other words, people are getting screwed daily by these companies.       Video games aren't the problem. I've been a huge gamer since I was a kid and I still play WoW after 10 years and a bunch of other online games as well and still train and do cardio everyday. It's all about time management.    Do you guys agree/disagree with this quote?  Personally, this summarizes my entire weight loss journey. At one point I realized that fulfilling my food cravings would never make me happy. Sure, I could eat that bowl of ice cream, and I'll be happy for what? 10 min as I'm eating it, and then what? My life isn't better because I've eaten that bowl of ice cream. I'm not happier because I fulfilled that food craving.  And now every time I think of having a 'cheat meal', I think to myself, sure, with how far I've come, I could probably allow myself this one cheat meal and it wouldn't make much of a difference in the long run. But what would that do? It wouldn't make me happy. What makes me truly happy is knowing that I said no to this cheat meal, that, by enduring the mental pain of not giving in to this desire, I stayed true to my ideals and to the idea of a healthy lifestyle that have allowed me to come this far into my weight loss journey.  Every time I've had issues with cravings, I kept this quote in mind and it allowed me to stay strong and not give in.    People like you are the reason I wear a tank top. :p   I'm well aware that STZ is used as a model of type 1 and 2 diabetes in non-human subjects, but nice assumption that I'm an idiot here. I didn't elaborate on the study because no one seemed to be interested.    Today was my first day stimulant free in a long, long time! Stimulants have helped me lose weight, but after about a year of being on some kind of stimulant literally every single day, the side effects had gotten a bit out of control.... I'm feeling extremely tired, but no nasty sugar cravings like I was fearing, so I'm happy. I had nothing but 2 small cups of coffee today, which is a change for me. Hopefully I can go on while remaining drug free and still maintain my leanness.    I'm not too sure why people are downvoting...   They didn't look at that in the study.   For me, there is no 'diet' or 'cheat meals'. Humans were not born with the need to eat ice cream, chips or any food in particular. We were born with the need to ingest proteins, carbohydrates, fats and micro nutrients, that's it. The intense desire to eat anything has been socially wired into your brain. The day you realize that, the need to 'have cheat meals' pretty much goes away, at least in my case it did. Also, I realized that living by my everyday wants would never make me truly happy. I mean, sure, I can have that bowl of ice cream, and I'll be satisfied for maybe 10 min as I'm eating it, and then what? Nothing happens. My life isn't better, but now I also have to deal with the fact that I'll be hungry in an 1 hour at most because ice cream isn't very filling and even though I have 400 calories less to work with for the rest of the day. People need to stop with the whole 'cheat meal' madness and realize that there are many food products that are filling, healthy AND satisfying to eat. Remember, it's a lifestyle, not something that you must force upon yourself or else you're setting yourself up for failure in the long run.    No, it just refers to the cognitive impairment caused by Streptozotocin-induced Diabetes milletus.   From the study's Discussion section:  'In the present study, the results demonstrated that leptin could attenuate STZinduced cognitive impairment, which was characterized by the poor performance of the rats in the Morris water maze test. Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, significantly abrogated the protective effects of leptin against the STZinduced rat cognitive impairment. The findings of these results suggested, therefore, that AMPK activation contributed to the underlying mechanism of the therapeutic effect of leptin in STZinduced cognitive impairment.'      Some people do have a reduced ability to lose weight with caloric restriction, but you are correct.    Nope. When I was fat I felt depressed and hopeless, I would never go back.    As you can see, the discovery of and subsequent research into the effects of the leptin adipokine hormone has been hugely misinterpreted by fitness enthusiasts. What science initially said is 'there is a significant correlation between fluctuations in caloric intake, levels of circulating leptin and their effects on the endocannabinoid system', and this was somehow falsely interpreted as 'you can binge eat to ''reset'' your metabolism'. Wrong.     http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10567012  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11126336   I would suggest removing all 'binge foods' from your house, that's what I used to do when I had a hard time not eating sweet foods. If there's no food to comfort yourself, you have no choice other than finding another way to deal with your stress.    No, this is completely false. Research has shown that the leptin hormone (which controls appetite and metabolism) is correlated with calories yes, but only with calories from carbohydrates, not sugar, fats or everything else. This is why refeed days that athletes have are high in complex carbohydrates, and moderate in proteins and low in fats. Refeed days are certainly not an excuse to 'cheat' or binge on sweets. There is no excuse to ever do that.    I think it would be more useful to ask yourself why you went on a binge in a first place and how you can prevent that in the future!   Congrats!    Today I had another grueling leg day. I'm exhausted!  I've kept my caloric intake the same, reduced my protein and carb intakes and increased my fat intake instead, and it seems to be working! I'm keeping my workout intensity, strength and mass but I feel leaner! I've also dropped my water and sodium intakes, cleaning up that aspect of my diet really helped a lot.    http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0120413  Turns out intermittent fasting makes you lose weight, protects your liver and heart, but damages your brain in the short run (Fig 5. IF changes oxidative damage to biomolecules in a tissue-specific manner).  Intermittent fasting (IF) as defined by this study is alternating 24h periods of ad libitum (unlimited) feeding (AF) with 24h periods of fasting. Even though numerous studies have found that intermittent fasting and caloric restriction in the long run act as protection for the brain by reducing protein oxidative damage in that specific area, this study found the opposite, that is, that IF results in a 'significant increase in protein carbonyl signals in the brain of IF rats (Fig. 5), without measurable changes in mitochondrial function (Fig. 2),ROS release (Fig. 4), MDA or NO2-Tyr (Fig. 5)' in the short run. The researchers were unable to explain this important discrepancy, but hopefully future research will be able to do so.                              Cupcakes are the kind of food that is made specifically to make you want to eat more than one. That's why I avoid them altogether.    I train everyday because I enjoy it, but I also eat nutritionally optimal foods regardless of whether I exercise or not. Sure, caloric intake is what optimally matters, but macro and micro nutrient choices affect not only general health, but also whether people generally reach their target caloric intake or not. For example, people who eat foods that are rich in sugar and devoid of everything else tend to be hungrier and struggle to not overeat. I eat lean proteins, starchy vegetables, complex carb foods and healthy fats, and avoid everything else, because, from a nutritional point of view, there is very little need to eat anything else.    In my experience, one does not simply eat just one cookie, so I avoid cookies altogether.    I lift weights and do cardio 7 days a week, mostly because I enjoy it. You could probably lift weights every 2 days and do cardio everyday and get the same results, but I legitimately enjoy it so I organize my training in a way that allows me to do resistance training/lift weights every day. People say you can 'over train', but that's not simply not true, you just need to eat properly and sleep enough. I've taken a single day off in the last 4 months and I'm doing just fine.  My days usually look like this:  7am wake up  30min cardio  Meal 1  10am 1h of working out  Mid workout snack  11am 1 hour of working out + 20min of post workout cardio  Meal 2  5pm meal 3  10h pm - sleep  Rinse and repeat.       Personally, I just eat for survival purposes, and to improve muscular mass while maintaining body fat or vice versa, so I have what could be considered a fairly 'strict diet' by normal people's standards. I only eat things that I regard as optimal in terms of macro and micro nutrient content, and I track all my calories as best I can.    Yes. Phenotype is basically an organism's observable physical characteristics or traits. In this case, simply put, they simply observed the subjects' ability to burn fat via caloric restriction and other factors (such as physical activity and sleep), but diet is the only factor for which they found a difference that, they hypothesize, is based on certain genes.    I feel you man. The ultimate goal is to lose fat while maintaining mass and vice versa... But naturally it gets hard very quickly. It takes really on point dieting.    It's generally believed that eating behaviors are regulated by two pathways in the brain: the homeostatic and the hedonic (reward) pathways. When you wake up in the morning and have breakfast, this is the homeostatic pathway: your brain that you need to 'break the fast' in order to function properly throughout the day. On the other hand, when you think 'I really want to open up this bag of chips right now', this is the hedonic pathway, which are colloquially referred to as 'food cravings'.   One of the many reasons why our society is plagued with obesity and other metabolic diseases is that people are raised without being taught the difference between the need to eat for survival purposes (that is, because you need nutrients in order for your body to produce the energy that it needs to survive), and the need to eat because of an exogenous factor, such as boredom, stress, or peer pressure. Even worse, people are taught that it's fine to reward oneself with food, or to eat as a mean of socializing with others. Combine this with the fact that most people are ignorant about the basic scientific principles behind food and eating, and it's no wonder that people are getting increasingly obese.  Another reason for cravings is having a diet that is rich in sugar and low in everything else. Foods that are rich in sugar and low in fibers and proteins have a high glycemic load, meaning they are digested extremely quickly, because they cause the body to secrete more insulin, and insulin drives nutrients into the body at a faster rate based on how much of it is produced. When your stomach is emptied out, an hormone known as ghrelin and of which the purpose is to stimulate appetite is produced, so the time food spends in your digestive system is pretty much equal to the time you feel 'full' from eating it. So with sugar rich foods, which are digested extremely quickly, you don't feel gastrically and psychologically satisfied very long. This is why you can eat an entire bar of chocolate and feel as though you hadn't eaten anything 2 hours later.      A thousand times yes. This is the one I use, and it's just perfect. Not overly complicated to use, and you can easily bring it with you anywhere you go.   	173
       no lets neither have laws mandating(jim crowe) nor preventing('civil rights' act) discrimination... heres a radical idea... give ppl the individual freedom of choice to decide for themselves who they wish to interact with... yeah i know CRAZZZyyyy.  People have the right to do what ever they want so long as they do not interfere with anothers rights... you have NO RIGHT to a job.... you have NO RIGHT to use force of government to MAKE ME, under threat of expropriation or arrest to provide you with a service in a certain way...  thats called EXTORTION actually.... you have NO RIGHT to utilize MY PROPERTY in a manner not consistent with MY own preferences... for godsakes go find another cakemaker and leave me the hell alone...   Jim crow and civil rights took the nation from one extreme to the other.... both using violence of government to force certain peoples preferences on everybody else... no, we want to be free to choose for ourselves who we associate and interact with in society... how can anyone with a straight face even argue against this?   Like i said if you dont believe in property rights or that individuals have the right to freely choose whom to associate with.... ill be at your house in 10 min with all my drunken friends and we will leave when we want to...   right.. cause the most logical thing to do is use government to FORCE racists and bigots hire and serve people they hate... lol another ELS FAIL and a basic misunderstanding of the individual right of free association... unless you are bisexual, you discriminate against half the human race... get a grip... we have individual preference... you dont discriminate or respect property rights? ok good, me and all my drunken irish friends will be at your house at 8:00 tonight... and we will leave when we want lol  [Dr. Walter Williams schools you on discrimination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKgHc6bWqZ4)   LMAO... you're horrible... lol   another free association fail... when will someone come along and talk about the right to discriminate on tv?

 Look at the base of his thumb and you see bad bruising, add the bandage down the arm and would say he has an injury so pointless taking him to America when he wont play so let him stay at home and work on fitness   Cole vs Antonio Valencia though wasn't for some reason   Individual awards like team of the year are a load of shite, David Luiz got in world team of the year. He is brilliant though and will be remembered as one the greatest England has ever produced    That was good old dithering Dave thinking he wasn't strong enough for the league in the end  Can you also show me where he said it was a done deal?   Ronaldo   Trust me schweinsteiger is absolutely amazing and I genuinely still can't believe it but think it will be bigger than him    We will go for one massive thing which if it comes off would be huge   What do you mean wasn't going to be on the books this year? As in if we hadn't got him we wouldn't have spent the money, correct but we did so us now not spending the money is us saving it   Hahahahahahaha    Hahahahahahaha   Stopping us wasting money as you put it is still saving money as it is expenditure we aren't now using, before falcao came we lost vida, Ferdinand and evra who probably earned that amount so his wage was just money we had spent anyway so all in all yeh we are saving money.   I work at Manchester royal hospital and we generally use purple and clear bags for bloods, but the guy could literally have just grabbed a bag and used it   Yeh because he's saved us another 250 grand a week wages you weird bell, so he was shit it happens but with him, RVP and Nani gone that about 600 grand a week saved   Add falcaos wages to that as well...   The article is a load of shit, apparently he told all this to a Milan fan who met him at Wimbledon who remembered everything fergie said perfectly and then told tuttosport   We would not take a 20 million hit after one season, not a chance   I've read a lot of shit in my life, but this right here is the fucking biggest steaming pile I've ever had the displeasure of letting my eyes witness.

 I suppose we all have different senses of humor here. I for one, would not laugh at someone kicking BB like a soccer ball.   IMO the only comedic relief that should be in star wars is C3P0.   The whole point of the new trilogy is to tell a new story, not retread the exact same story as the OT. They might as well clone Vader, and Sheev, and then we can have the exact same original films all over again!   They tried slapstick comedy with Jar Jar. Look how that turned out.   Clone of Tarkin sounds stupid and leads me to think this is just fan fiction.   I hope there's no cringey "jokes". Kicking BB-8 would not be funny.   You'd think they learned that "funny" characters don't work with Jar Jar   That would be so awful. It'd be like Han Solo turning to the camera and winking.   When you say it will dispell many rumors, do you think it will confirm the general plot that MSW has come up with or disprove it?   I'm pretty sure in the upcoming Battlefront game you will be able to fly TIE fighters on Hoth.  Another question, how did they get the AT-ATs onto the ground in the first place? Just drop them from orbit?   I've always wanted to be a Y-wing pilot, even though everyone else would probably rather fly the X-wings.   Yes but Boba died (in terms of the film canon). And I wouldn't want to see him shoved in the new one just to be like "Hey guys, you love this character, here he is!" Too many old characters already.   The point is that Luke was swayed by the dark side, but ultimately triumphed over it and learned balance. It would be annoying to unwrite all of that for the sake of the new trilogy.   When I said I could see it under certain circumstances, I was thinking more along the lines of he goes a little insane while in exile. I just don't think his character would be the kind of person to drop all that he's learned throughout his journey and become evil.   I know but seeing people well past their prime when we didn't really want to is what I'm saying.    Boba Fett has no place in Ep7. THAT would be lazy storytelling. I can see Luke going to the darkside under certain circumstances, despite the fact that it is a retread of Vader, and goes against his character. I'm not hoping for that though.  What I do want to see is good writing, as in dialogue that doesn't make you cringe. I also want to see some new and interesting characters, things we haven't seen before. My worry is that JJ will try too hard to focus on the OT and the past, that he won't be able to move us forward enough.  In terms of the returning cast, I really only care about Luke. Han and Leia seem like they are characters who were never meant to get old. I don't really want to see old Leia in a slave outfit or old Han struggling to catch his breath while walking.  All in all, I want to see something written well that is not too hung up on the OT.   Its quite likely    If anybody has something to discuss then make a new thread cause I'm hungry for some star wars talk.   No proof, but considering the amount of characters it's entirely possible. I just wanted to hear the opinions of others.   It's like poetry, it rhymes.    I dont understand this new meme   I assume too bloated as in too many characters, not enough time to develop them, resulting in a mess.  [Link to thread.](http://boards.4chan.org/tv/thread/58347456) It's mostly shitposting but there is a little bit of discussion.    I was in a SW thread on 4chan and someone said that a test cut was shown to the guys at Disney and no one really knew what to make of it because it was very bloated in terms of characters.  Now obviously we can take this with a grain of salt because there was no source or explanation, but it got me thinking that he may be right considering the amount of characters which will be featured in TFA. I would list them all but I'm sure everyone here is well aware.  So I wanted to know your thoughts on this.   This looks fun. Does anyone know if there will be an actual story mode? Or at least missions of Star Wars battles we already know? It seems like single-player Stormtrooper zombies could get boring.   I agree with this guy.

I remember seeing jokes about a fourth season 4 years ago and thinking they were as crazy as Firefly having another season. Unrelated story, i found the first season of Firefly on box set in my dad's closet and asked why he had it. He said his buddy let him borrow it a few years ago but never gave it back because he liked it so much. He then said he forgot about the show and can't wait to watch all of the new seasons.

 Agree with the others about being able to live in almost any neighborhood for that amount. I would also look at East Village if you're looking for close to downtown. It's the neighborhood where Petco Park is.  Light rail is OK but not great. I know a guy at work who commutes every day from La Jolla into Mission Valley and he likes it. But it requires him taking a bus then the trolley. But if you live along the line it's OK.  I wouldn't necessarily look at Gaslamp just because it's so noisy and touristy but it's perfectly safe. I lived in Little Italy and East Village and both neighborhoods were nice.   North Park is nice and is really hip. A different vibe completely than Gaslamp or Little Italy.  Traffic is nothing here. If you want to see traffic go to L.A. Although traffic along the 805 is pretty tight. But you're not looking to move down to the south bay or Chula Vista. I commuted from the downtown area for years and traffic was never really an issue.  I've been here 10 years now and I'm trying to think of what I wish I knew before I moved here. The only thing I would have done differently is spent a bit more time exploring other neighborhoods. I moved into Little Italy and pretty much stayed in that area for a while but I wish I had done more exploring.    It matters when you're trying to keep your 7 year old from learning the F bomb.

The games didn't get that annoying as you don't need to be out when they are happening. Plus part of the charm of the area is being around people.

What are your goals? Do you have a program or are you winging it?    Maybe it's because I live in California but that situation doesn't spook me at all. We pass cars like that all the time here. I think I saw the recommendation for just accelerating out of that and that's what I would have done too.   No point getting aggravated over situations like that. Just hit the gas and be on your way.   This one definitely made me say "WTF". There's an american version too though although the man is not the center of attention.      So you've got no choice but to accept? Should the first choice say "regretfully decline"?  	14

Weakened and dehydrated, many of the trees are being finished off by bark beetles  tiny brown insects that thrive in dry conditions, chewing away at pines and making them brittle.  Officials say they are seeing an uptick in bark beetles amid the drought. In the San Bernardino forest, bark beetle infestations were considered a factor in deadly fires that devoured swaths of mountainside in 2003.  The trees natural defense against the beetles lies in their sticky resin, said Timothy Paine, an entomologist at UC Riverside who has studied the beetles and their environment.  The water in properly hydrated trees creates pressure internally that pushes the resin out to the trees surface, deflecting beetles that dont want to get caught in it, Paine said. When a tree is dried up, it cant produce additional resin that protects it from the beetles, making a perfect opportunity for them to colonize, Paine said.  If you have a drought, you get large numbers of trees that are susceptible, Paine said. The beetles build up their populations.

Back Additional info, from RSOE Updated: Tuesday, 05 May, 2015 at 14:50 UTC Description According to reports, underwater volcano Axial Seamount has erupted again, as a geologist in Oregon State had predicted earlier. The volcano is present 300 miles off the Oregon Coast. Before this, the volcano erupted four years ago and in 1998. The reports stated that the underwater volcano does not pose any threat to humans. But a research on the volcano could help in predicting volcanic eruptions elsewhere. Dr. Bill Chadwick, an Oregon State geologist, said the volcano eruption is a common occurrence on earth, but scientists and geologists know very little about the eruptions because oceans make it very difficult to understand what has been happening beneath the surface. In 2006, Chadwick and one of his colleagues predicted that the Axial Seamount would erupt again before 2014. Before the latest eruption, the volcano erupted in 2011. In September, 2014, they predicted that another eruption would occur in 2015 and the latest eruption has proved them right. According to the reports, researchers have planned to start an expedition this summer where they will visit the site and use submersible vehicles to observe the location where they think the eruption has taken place. Chadwick said earthquakes of low magnitude are caused by magma forcing its way up to the surface to erupt. It is the location where researchers can learn several things about these processes that are still mystery, Chadwick added. Eruption in 2011 pressure from the magma had pushed the sea floor up. While providing information about the volcano, Chadwick said, "The volcano inflates like a balloon. So there's magma being fed from below and as that balloon inflates, the seafloor rises up. It's been rising up at a rate that hasn't been seen before". Then the sea floor dropped over the course of the eruption.      hydroponics:)   The drought conditions are weakening the trees, making them more prone to insect damage.    hurry!      http://www.fs.fed.us/foresthealth/technology/pdfs/MpbWestbb_Summary.pdf   "For example, according to the Americas Water analysis, much of the West and Midwest are in a pattern of long-term, chronic deficit with regard to water useeven as some of those areas are net-exporters of high water-consuming crops. This suggests that by shifting water-intensive crop production to less water-stressed regions, overall national water stress could be substantially reduced. But in order to do so, policy makers will need a much more robust set of models that address the complex interplay of factors affecting water supply and use."

(AP)  California water regulators adopted sweeping, unprecedented restrictions Tuesday on how people, governments and businesses can use water amid the state's ongoing drought, hoping to push reluctant residents to deeper conservation.  The State Water Resources Control Board approved rules that force cities to limit watering on public property, encourage homeowners to let their lawns die and impose mandatory water-savings targets for the hundreds of local agencies and cities that supply water to California customers.  Gov. Jerry Brown had pushed for the more stringent regulations, arguing that voluntary conservation efforts have so far not yielded the water savings needed amid a four-year drought. He ordered water agencies to cut urban water use by 25 percent compared with 2013, the year before he declared a drought emergency.  "It is better to prepare now than face much more painful cuts should it not rain in the fall," board Chairwoman Felicia Marcus said Tuesday as the board voted 5-0 to approve the new rules.  Although the rules are called mandatory, it's still not clear what punishment the state water board and local agencies can or will impose for those that don't meet the targets. Board officials said they expect dramatic water savings as soon as June and are willing to add restrictions and penalties for agencies that lag.  But the board lacks staff to oversee each of the hundreds of water agencies, which range dramatically in size and scope. Some local agencies that are tasked with achieving savings do not have the resources to issue tickets to those who waste water, and many others have chosen not to do so.  Despite the dire warnings, it's also still not clear that Californians have grasped the seriousness of the drought or the need for conservation. Data released by the board Tuesday showed that Californians conserved little water in March, and local officials were not aggressive in cracking down on waste.  A survey of local water departments showed water use fell less than 4 percent in March compared with the same month in 2013. Overall savings have been only about 9 percent since last summer.  Under the new rules, each city is ordered to cut water use by as much as 36 percent compared with 2013. Some local water departments have called the proposal unrealistic and unfair, arguing that achieving steep cuts could cause higher water bills, declining property values and dissuade projects to develop drought-proof water technology such as desalination and sewage recycling.  The board again Tuesday rejected calls to create easier targets for communities in drier areas or for cities that have been conserving since before the drought.  An economic analysis of the water board's proposal commissioned by the board estimated that private water utilities and local water departments would lose a total of about $1 billion in revenue through lost water sales if they meet the board's targets, meaning they are likely to raise prices to make up the difference.  Brown said last week he would push for legislation authorizing fines of up to $10,000 for extreme wasters of water, but he needs legislative approval to do so and no bill has been introduced. Another tool  tiered pricing, in which the price rises as water use goes up  is in question after a court struck down water rates designed to encourage conservation in San Juan Capistrano in Orange County.         true.    http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-06/tasmanian-weather-power-cuts-persist-as-high-winds-lash-state/6447734  Tasmanian weather: Power restored after high winds lash state.     yep,  ok when you hear that " Parts of northern and central Tasmania are subject to a severe storm warning with forecast winds of up to 130km/h, heavy rain and snow."

Description The number of volcanic earthquakes recorded in Hakone, Kanagawa Prefecture, surged Tuesday, with 85 quakes recorded before 8 a.m., compared with 34 for all of Monday, the Meteorological Agency said. Of the quakes Tuesday, two that shook the area between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. were strong enough to be felt. They registered level 1, or the lowest, on the Japanese intensity scale of 7, the agency said. The focus of both was about 10 km underground. The agency said it still believes the possibility that the Hokone volcano will erupt is low, and it is maintaining the alert level at 1 on the scale of 5. However, hot steam could suddenly be expelled from the ground in or near the Owakudani Valley, the agency warned, urging tourists not to enter areas designated as off-limits. Local officials have barred visitors from entering recreational trails and hiking courses in the valley. The number of volcanic quakes began to surge April 26, though only two were recorded last Friday. However, 37 earthquakes were recorded Saturday, followed by 36 on Sunday and 34 on Monday.

Mike Huckabee's Craziest Comments http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/mike-huckabee-still-talking-crazy-20110505   Playing-it-coy presidential candidate Mike Huckabee is taking heat for comparing failure to act on the federal debt to  what else?  letting the Nazis get away with the Holocaust. "Let there never be a time in this country when some father has to look over his daughter's shoulder and see her ask the haunting question, 'why didn't somebody do something?'" he told a crowd of NRA members last weekend. (Steve Kornacki at Salon points out that Huckabee has used the exact same anology before, in relation to abortion.)   It's an open question whether Huckabee is crazy like a fox or crazy like a ... lunatic. What's not in dispute is that he's some kind of crazy. If you have any doubts on that score, consider these collected Huck-isms.  Obamas worldview was shaped by a world filled with madrassas: "I do think he has a different worldview and I think it's in part molded out of a very different experience. Most of us grew up going to Boy Scout meetings, you know, our communities were filled with Rotary Clubs, not madrassas."  Hillary skipped the 2010 campaign trail to have an "alibi" when she challenged Obama in 2012: "She saw this train wreck coming and took off for Cambodia."  Obama never uses the word "terrorism": "[W]ith a liberal President - you're going to get universal healthcare, you're going to get higher taxes, you're going to get weak foreign policy, you're going to get a flat refusal to acknowledge the use of the term 'terrorist' or 'terrorism.'"  Homsexuality is like pedophilia, bestiality: "Well, I dont think thats a radical view to say were going to affirm marriage.

(Reuters) - The federal Office of Management and Budget has granted U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack the authority to transfer an additional $330 million in emergency funds for the agency's handling of the quickly spreading avian influenza outbreak, USDA agency sources told Reuters on Tuesday.  The funds will be used to cover indemnity claims filed by poultry farmers whose flocks have been infected by the highly pathogenic H5 virus and other issues related to the outbreak, the sources told Reuters. The additional funds, added to the $84.5 million previously set aside by USDA for the outbreak, bring the federal costs so far to at least $414.5 million.      details,details..well I will now precede to spend my day using some portion of my brain to solve this dilemma.

"The Newkirk House, also known as the Summit House, located at 510 Summit Avenue is the oldest surviving structure in Jersey City, New Jersey. The two-story Dutch Colonial building, composed of sandstone, brick, and clapboard dates to 1690.[1][2]  Originally one story, the outer walls are two feet of stone fitted in lime and mortar. Beams of timber in the basement are six-by-twelve inches and those on the second floor are four-by-six inches spaced four-feet apart. Eight-inch wood pegs, rather than nails, were employed during the time of construction."  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newkirk_House  I also like hawks   owls  hanging out and eating up any rats that might try to sneak in.

Chlorine leak stopped at Youngstown wastewater plant By Gerry Ricciutti Published: May 4, 2015, 10:21 am  Updated: May 4, 2015, 7:11 pm   YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (WKBN)  It was quiet Monday evening at the Youngstown wastewater treatment plant on Poland Avenue, but it was a very different scene around 9:15 a.m., shortly after liquid chlorine started leaking from a pipe.  The Himrod Avenue Expressway between U.S. Route 62 and Interstate 680 and the section of Poland Avenue in front of the plant, between Gibson Street and Powers Way, will be closed until 8 a.m. Tuesday.  Shortly after 9 a.m. Monday, workers evacuated the facility after potentially hazardous liquid chlorine began leaking from a valve as workers were trying to switch one-ton tanks of the chemical, which is used in the water treatment process. Firefighters and HazMat crews responded quickly, put on protective gear and got inside and shut off the leak, but that was not the end.  Unfortunately, they lost about 500 pounds of liquid chlorine that remained in the building, that did not get mixed off, so we are going to have to slowly allow the air exchangers within that building to mix it with air and release it back into the environment, Youngstown Fire Department Battalion Chief Sil Caggiano said.  What complicated the problem is that liquid chlorine freezes when it is exposed to the air and firefighters found a lot of what had leaked had frozen in large puddles on the floor of the building rather than evaporating into the atmosphere. They now have to wait for the chemical to warm up and then dissipate.   And until that happens, firefighters opted to close both Poland Avenue and the nearby Expressway, as well as the businesses inside the nearby Performance Place Industrial Park, as precautions.  Officials have said that, barring drastic change, there is no public health risk from the chlorine leak at the Youngstown wastewater treatment plant. It was contained around 11:45 a.m.  Crews on the scene were initially worried about wind blowing the gas towards the east and northeast and sent a truck with a measuring device to the east side of the Mahoning River to check for the presence of chlorine.  Fire officials are warning citizens to avoid the area around the plant and shelter in place, with doors and windows closed, unless notified otherwise.  Chlorine can cause irritation of the lungs and eyes, as well as difficulty breathing. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has put together a fact sheet on chlorine."      "President Barack Obama plans to nominate Marine Commandant Gen. Joe Dunford to become the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Americas top uniformed military leader, two sources briefed on the decision said Monday. Obama is also expected to nominate Air Force Gen. Paul Selva, now head of the U.S. Transportation Command, to become vice chairman, they said."         mighty fine question.  She seems a bit angry,no?         I sort of wish that there was some sort of contract addendum that read something along the lines that were FWeather to win; that 3/4 of his absurd earnings would be donated to woman shelters/'stop hitting your spouse/gf/bf/children' education, and to rehab of those harmed by such violence.   "John Oliver Perfectly Describes the "Woman-Battering Human Landfill" That Is Floyd Mayweather By Inae Oh| Mon May 4, 2015 11:01 AM EDT  Email 11 While issuing a takedown of Bud Light's awful new #UpForWhatever tagline last night, which included a clip of a woman calling the campaign a tad "rapey," John Oliver snuck in quite the perfect description of another awful subject, Floyd Mayweather.  "That's true, but it would be great if you could use a slightly more serious word than 'rapey'," Oliver said. "It's somewhat diminishingIt's like saying Floyd Mayweather is a smidge assaulty.

The Kliuchevskoi, the most powerful existing chain giants in the Russian peninsula of Kamchatka volcano, today launched clouds of gas-steam and ash to a height of seven thousand five hundred meters above the level the sea. Emissions were captured by the observatory of geophysics and volcanology, a subsidiary of the Academy of Science of Russia in the Far East. The wind spread the ash cloud at a distance of 40 kilometers to the northeast, toward the Gulf of Ozernovskiy, and does not represent a danger for the populations, the regional Emergency Situations Ministry, in a report televised on federal channels said. However, civil defense declared code yellow -alert averagely for aviation security and recommended to travelers refrain from organizing tourist expeditions in the area of the volcano, active since 1 January. Kliuchevskoi ranks as the largest and most powerful active basaltic volcano in Eurasia, with four thousand 850 meters. Actually it gives its name to a group of giants (Kliuchevskaya) located near the east coast of the peninsula as Ploski Tolbachik, Shiveluch and Kizimen responsible for the intense seismic activity in the region since late 2012.

 Caliphate News Network (CNN)                                             The title is what got me, I think. This bill would not stop spying on Americans. It would just make it harder for them to use company dbs for their spying. They still have many other tools to use. I apologize if I came off a little brash.    I agree! I believe when we build support for incremental bills like this we should always continue to inform people that the fight is not over. That this is not the cure. That there is still much to do. I just know once this bill gets passed you will hear things like, "They just passed that bill that requires the gov to have a warrant to collect your data. We won!" and that would be far from reality. So, when discussing bills like this we must fight for their passage but also press the fact that this is not over. We would still have many mtns to climb. Defense of the Constitution is a constant battle. Its under attack from all sides, every day.    I agree it would be a move in the right direction but would passing this bill close the door on discussions of the gov still collecting data? I am afraid people will take this bill as, "They no longer collect our data." Which would be false. This could lead to the discussion losing steam and nothing ever being done about the gov collection. They do not need company DBs to collect your data. So, what is stopping that?   IF that is what they are saying then it would be a good thing. But what about the US Government collecting information in their own DBs without a warrant? Would that still be in effect?   Reps. Ted Poe (R-TX, 2nd), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA, 19th), and Thomas Massie (R-KY, 4th) said in a statement Wednesday that the bill -- the End Warrantless Surveillance of Americans Act -- would force the government to get a warrant before it can access **databases** containing American data.  This statement worries me. Does this mean they can still collect the data but can only access it if they have a warrant? That would still mean there are large DBs with all of your communications stored in them. How would this DB be protected? What kind of safeguards would be in place to prevent malicious intent?   I would prefer them not to store any data on Americans unless a warrant has been issued.    Colbert is a political leader? news to me.   France should sell Qatar more fighter jets.

"He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983." - Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998       "[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs." - Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998.       "Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process." - Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998.       "Hussein has ... chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies." - Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999.       "There is no doubt that . Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies." - Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, Dec, 5, 2001.       "We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them." - Sen. Carl Levin (d, MI), Sept. 19, 2002.       "We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country. Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power." - Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002.       "We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is using and developing weapons of mass destruction." - Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002.       "The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons." - Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002.       "I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force  if necessary  to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security." - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002.       "There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years . We also should remember we have alway s underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction." - Sen. Jay Rockerfeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002       "He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do." - Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002.       "In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons." - Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002       "We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction. "[W]ithout question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. And now he has continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real." - Sen. John F.

Burping and farting while zipping up my pants after a long alcohol induced piss.   Boot the computer and when you see the Dell splash/bios screen immediately start pressing Ctrl+F11.  So, I am assuming that this disc from your friend was not a Dell OEM disk. Probably a retail copy.  Is there a Windows license sticker on the bottom of your laptop? Check under the battery, as well. Key retrievers will not give you the correct key on OEM installs, FME. Try to find that license sticker. If you find the correct key we may be able to use the retail copy of the DVD.  Try calling Dell support and requesting a reinstallation DVD. They *were* allowing 1 per customer but I am not sure how old your system is or if they are still doing this for Win7 machines.  If Dell will not ship you the DVD try locating a Dell Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit DVD. Ask your friends and family. If you can get your hands on this DVD it *should not* ask you for a key.   Do not use your friends key. You have a key, correct?  A few questions:      What version of Windows was installed on the laptop when purchased? Windows 7 Home Premium? 32bit or 64bit?      What version of Windows is your product key for?      How did you restore it? What procedure did you use?      Have you tried Ctrl+F11 just to make sure the recovery partition is no longer there?   Have you tried Dells built-in system recovery? Ctrl+F11 at boot. Of course, if you wiped the drive, including the recovery partition, during a clean install this will not work. Also, do you have a Dell OEM Windows 7 Home Premium DVD or know someone that has one?           **TO ANYONE READING THIS:**     *If you purchase a new computer, please take a moment and create the recovery discs on first boot of a new system. Most manufacturers come with pre-loaded software and a recovery partition to create these discs.*   lol wat?      The only solution is bigger government.   Even let her choose where to go and what to watch? Do you throw your ace of spades the first hand?   Do you know how hard it is to find a job with 6 months vacation, free rent, free healthcare, and a Starbucks next door?    haha a comment thread of pissed off fanboys.

They have our best interests at heart.   /r/Murica would like a word with you, fellow patriot.   lol ditto      And here you are bringing absolutely nothing to the table but a rant about comments.   Thanks for your input.    haha, I have never met a Christian that has said anything of the sort. Not saying they do not exist but I live in the bible belt. Grew up southern baptist. The major reason I see or hear is confusion. Older people like things simple. On one side you have people saying its bad for you. On the other side its the cure for all things. Then you have the government that classifies it as harmful as heroin. Now you have to understand that majority of these elderly people have probably never tried marijuana. They only know that the US government says its as bad as heroin and that the news tells them that people who smoke pot are potheads and lazy. These elderly probably grew up during the aftermath of the Reefer Madness days. Then you had the 60s anti war demonstrators and the hippies who were portrayed as anarchists, murders, soldier haters. etc. In my experience, religion is the least reason people in the bible belt are anti legalization. With all that said, where do the majority of elderly retire? The south....the Bible belt. So its a catch all for the elderly who in turn has anti marijuana views because of the way its been portrayed to them the last 70-80 years. Some people will vote against on religious grounds. The majority? Not so much.    I am a bible thumper and I support legalization. I know many bible thumpers with similar views as mine. You know, it could be elderly people that have been manipulated their entire life by US government propaganda against Marijuana that is keeping it from happening. No religion required.    Netgear devices do come with a "Guest Network".   Did they ask Hillary the same question? What was her response?   A bigger government is the only solution. ^^^^/s   Time to come together as a society and ban toddlers. *Think of the children.*   Bigger government is the only solution. ^^^^/s   Well said   So long, freedom of speech, it was nice knowing you.

 Yes. Writing, music and film get screwed here. Maybe writing most of all, since live music and theater going is popular but no one wants to pay for live readings   I specified rich American pirates as being hypocritical, I didn't claim that all pirates were rich or American.       Yes it is "being a dick," but social pressure and cultural norms ALLOW them to be dicks.   When you are desperate artist who sees no way of making any money off your art except getting Taylor Swift level huge, you'll jump at every opportunity. When our culture---see this thread!--says artists are greedy jerks if they don't give everything away for free, then it makes it far easier to McDonald's to leech off artists without anyone caring.   This stuff doesn't happen in a vacuum.    Maybe doctors weren't the best examples, as many are really rich. I can even understand complaining about really rich artists. But in this thread and elsewhere you see so much hate towards artists who just want like poverty wage salary from their art.    You don't think the devaluation of art and the constant refrain that all artists should do things for free and any money is just icing on top they should never ask contributes?    You need electricity and an internet access to pirate too, so I'm not really sure what you are arguing?    As an artist yourself you are free to make your work free!  I mean most authors publish fiction free online or write essays that are free to read. Most musicians put some songs online.    Not sure how to feel about this. There is way too much bullshit in Amazon reviews, with many bought and paid for. OTOH, any author who is in the community has hundreds if not thousands of Facebook friends and twitter followers who they don't really know.    More like:   What about poor people? Do they just not get to make art? Only rich people would make art, people who can afford to work for free?   (But to answer your actual question: TV is free, YouTube is free, many museums are free, public domain books are free, libraries are free, etc. There is tons of free art in the world, more than you could ever consume in your life.)     I don't think that people will stop creating art simply because they're not getting paid.   Totally disagree with you.   1) There are a lot of people who will always do art, but will do MUCH less of it if they don't have enough money to live off it. People white about George R. R. Martin taking years to finish a book... imagine how long it would take if he worked 50 hours a week at a desk job!  2) Anyone who works in a  creative industry for more than a decade can tell you tons of talented people give up and quit because they can't make money. It's not like those people say "waaaah! no one is buying my work so I'm going to quit to spite them!" But rather, they make no money but still have bills to pay so they work a full time job. They get promoted, they have kids, they live a life. They don't have time to make art for free with all of life's other responsibilities.       But from what I've read the corporations cause far more damage to an artist than the pirates do.  I agree with a lot of what you said, but to me the piracy and free-content movement has totally empowered corporations. Nowadays, huge corporate bands expect to get art for free! There are like weekly stories about McDonald's hosting a showcase at SXSW and asking bands to play for free, or Showtime doing "crowd sourced" artwork contests where they get stuff for free.   Corporations LOVE the idea that they don't have to pay artists.   I mean, you daily read articles from working musicians and authors about how impossible it is to have a regular income from art anymore, yet Exxon, Coke, Nike and the rest are doing fine.    These are just empty platitudes though. The reality on the ground is that it's nearly impossible to get paid anymore. It's much harder to be a middle class musician/novelist/whatever than it was 20 years ago.       You can't stop piracy.  I hate to break it to you dude but... you can't stop any crimes entirely. We've been trying to stop murder for centuries and it happens every day! People will always steal, kill, speed, pirate, and anything else you can think of.   But it is probably possible to decrease crime.    So let me ask you, as an artist. Would you rather have more people see (and enjoy) your work but you don't get paid anymore? Or have them not see it at all, and you don't get paid?  Honestly? I think this is a false question. Here's how real life works: people have bills to pay. They have things they want to buy. They have children to raise and so on and so forth. If artists don't get paid, they have to work more--unless they are born rich. This means they have less time to work on their art, or else they change their art to fit the mass commercial market.   So either society has to figure out how to pay artists, or else only the rich and amateurs will ever make art.     There may be more to it than just this simple equation. It's easy to say an album or a film got 10,000 illegal downloads, but how many of the people downloading watched/listened?   Look, I understand piracy. I understand people download more stuff than they consume AND more than they would buy if piracy didn't exist.   BUT it is also true that many people pirate stuff they would buy otherwise. Trust me, I'm old enough to remember when everyone went from buying a couple CDs a month to buying zero a month when Napster and everything else broke out.    We've had a long time where the paradigm for access to works of art is a 'gatekeeper' model - you pay and you take your chances as to whether or not you'll like it (based on reviews, single releases, etc). How many of us have gone to see a film and wished we could get our money back, or even the time back that it took to watch it?  Welcome to everything in life though!  How many times have you eaten a meal that wasn't that good? Or seen a movie that you ended up not liking? Or gone bowling and ended up not enjoying it?   Why should artists be the only ones not paid though? Why don't you ask for money back when you realize you weren't as hungry as you thought you were? Or ask for a refund from an airline if your vacation is shitty?        ...but those two are not representative of the core of piracy.  Yep, totally agree. I hate how rich white American pirates with lots of disposable income will act like the fact that there are starving people in other parts of the world who can't afford books means that everyone should be able to pirate.     People want food stamps and a basic income, which amount to free food.  I don't think that's comparable. There are not workers who aren't getting paid to provide those things. Government workers get paid. The grocery stores that use food stamps get paid.    People want socialized medicine, which amounts to free doctors' visits.   Again, the doctors get paid.   But with art, people often attack artists who get paid and say they are "greedy" and evil and stuff. I've never heard someone say a doctor is "greedy" for wanting to get enough money to live on.      Books, and albums are often not worth twenty bucks a go,  But do they really cost that much? A hardcover book does, but a trade paperback is more like 15 before discounts--which are frequent--and ebooks, even from big 5 publishers, seem to be more like 9.99 before discounts.   In addition, services like Oyster give you unlimited ebooks for 9.99 a month.  Personally, I really think 10 bucks is a pretty great prize for a book or album that you can read or listen to for as many times as you want. Like, a movie ticket costs 15 bucks in a lot of places these days and that's only 2 hours of entertainment. Hell, I know people who spend 10 bucks a day on coffee who think that 10 for a book is a "rip off." I don't get that mindset.        The bulk of income for artists in the last 15 years has been by touring.   I think you mean musicians, other artists (painters, writers, etc.) don't make money from touring.   But did you read the article? It mentions that even pretty popular and famous bands like Grizzly Bear barely make any money touring. That's not really how musicians who aren't Jay Z level make money.       We should also recognize that it has nothing to do with art per se. People steal anything that can be stolen easily, which means anything that can be digitized: computer programs, personal data, video games, whatever.   Point being, I think it is silly when people pretend that it's about "art should be free, maaaaan." We'd all steal cars and boats if it was as easy as pirating an album.     A lot of artists who work for free are not worth being paid.   But I'm talking about artists who readers DO want to read, but don't want to pay for. For every book or film or album that sells, probably 100 pirated copies of it are downloaded.   No one is saying that you should never write for free, or no work should ever be free.    Did you read the article? It talks about how really famous bands and other artists whose names are widely known and their art widely consumed can't even make a decent salary off of it.   (Article also points out how artists gets attacked and insulted for not wanting to work for free.)   How does a human with any empathy get into this kind of mindset?    When David Byrne of Talking Heads recently declared he was pulling his catalog out of Spotify because of measly revenues from the service, and concerns about the sustainability of this distribution method for emerging artists, online commenters were less than sympathetic. Truly creative people are delighted to share their work and ideas for free, wrote one commenter. Another said, If you are only being creative as a means to get rich, then I dont want your crappy creation and I hope you go bust.      I think what's really galling about piracy is that there is already more free work than anyone can ever consume. The public domain stretches back to antiquity. There are libraries all over America and most countries. There is a flood of work to read published for free online every day.   Yet despite all that, people think they are also entitled to get every single other work for free too. No one would ever think that about non-artistic fields (a right to eat at every restaurant for free, a right to get medical advice from every doctor for free, etc.)    And the great point is definitely true: if consumers (readers/music fans/etc.) don't support arts, yet artists still have bills to pay... they have to turn to corporations and the elites to fund them, which is never a great situation for art.     My view is too many artists think their self expression is valuable in, and of itself.  I think this is utter nonsense, no offense.   What's crazy about today's deal is that people DO want work, they just don't want to pay. If no one wants to read your book, or listen to your music, you really can't complain. But if 10,000 people want to read your book or 50,000 people want to listen to your music so badly they download it illegally, but then they don't want to pay... that's really a problem. I have no problem with people wanting to ignore my work, but I do have a problem with people thinking they are entitled to get my work for free.   It's not that self-expression is valuable in and of itself, it's that people DO find it valuable and DO want to consume it, yet don't want to pay.          The problem I think is that Amazon's money pile for authors is picked by them. They can make it as big or small as they want. So more people reading more books might not translate to more money for authors in the KU program.          I bet it will be even less   Weiner is just straight up bad   I think they totally changed their whole deal a few years ago. Like you, I remember when they were just a cheating  site or place to steal essays, but now they are an ebook lender or something    I've never seen this before, but the answer is that the book has been changed for some reason... likely for a younger audience (like a children's book version of a classic book) by Michael Kerr. I can't find the info on this specific adaptation though.                               I assume you mean Wall Street.         Pretty much agree, except all the lines of dialogue (but the bones of a screenplay don't line up with novel writing)         Agree, the obsession with "world building" is weird. Most fiction, even SF/F stuff doesn't need that to the degree people fuss about it. Let it come naturally out of the story.                               Do not do. Vast majority of books don't sell 7k, and real publishers pay you, you don't pay them                  Well, I don't read those authors! Or at least they aren't favorites. And if someone like Cormac McCarthy or Don DeLillo wrote a regency romance I'd have to read because it would be so absurd!   It certainly feels like epic fantasy in the way that Star Wars might, but I think a ton of SF reads that way so I'd still call in SF.    All my favorite authors I'd read no matter what genre they wrote in.                         Yeah but Caspar's junk was blown off. I'm sure Ray lives, probably beabag rounds, but I think Caspar was tortured with real shotgun blasts.    Of course! But it's kind of hard to compare different artforms IMHO. Like what does it mean to say a painting is better or worse than a song? Or that a play is better or worse than a sculpture?   Books and movies are both narrative, so maybe more similar than those examples, but they are still very different in many ways.    Yeah but Ray is the main character here, both from like the amount of screentime and how the show was marketed.    It would be pretty cheap for him not to be dead... but he's also clearly not dead. No show has the balls to kill their star played by the biggest actor in episode 2.   Game of Thrones was crazy shocking to do it at the end of the season, but no one is going to do it at the start.    Nice, yeah I think there is a TON of crossover between SF, fantasy, and horror (and even mystery... Stephen King just won an Edgar.)   What I wonder is how many crossover awards there are between literary awards (pulitzer, NBA, booker, etc.) and the genre ones   Hmm, that makes me really wonder what authors have won awards in two such areas. Michael Chabon has both a Hugo and Pulitzer. Must be some others.     Highly successful authors will achieve a measure of success with anything they publish, but they are still most associated with, and have most of their sales in, one genre  Well, part of that is just a human need to put everything into a simple little box. It's much easier for critics and readers to think of people as doing just x or just y. This is especially true as time passes. As we move on, writers of the past get relegated to only a couple works that are representative.   How many people have read a Bram Stoker novel other than Dracula, for example? But he wrote a bunch! In the future, lots of authors we think have tons of great works will be remembered for only 1 or 2 and easily pigeonholed as representative of this or that specific style   Is it that hard?   Off the top of my head:   * JK Rowling writes fantasy and mysteries (latter under pen name)  * John Banville writes lit fiction and mysteries (latter under pen name)  * Stephen King has had success in a ton of genres  * Lots of literary fiction writers have "genre" books that did well. Colson Whitehead, Cormac McCarthy, Ben Percey, etc.   * LOTS of genre writers move freely between fantasy, science fiction, and horror.   * A bazillion writers have had luck in both fiction and non-fiction  etc.   The only people who seem to have a hard time with it are mediocore writers who just do really formulaic work in one niche.     They also take the risk on authors whose books may not earn back their advance, which means they use successful books to subsidise their gambles.  Yep, and thank god for that as far as I'm concerned. Basically all the books and movies I like are funded this way. If only sure-fire mass market hits ever were released culture would be really boring   There are certainly reasons why self-publishing is better, just saying that "suits" taking the money is sadly an issue everywhere      There are reasons to go self-pub and reasons to go traditional. But the "suits" are gonna have a field day either way.   Sure, traditional publishing takes a bigger percentage but they also * Pay an advance upfront * pay to have the book printed * Pay for editing, copyediting, proofing, and design * and (hopefully) pay for some kind of marketing  In addition, they have distribution that gets you into bookstores  Amazon takes a much lower cut, but also does nothing at all for your book other than transfer digital files for essentially zero cents and provide a platform where your book exists alongside 10 million others. That's not that much for a 30% cut!                  You think suits at Amazon wont profit off you?   that merely wishing for something doesn't make that thing happen. You have to fight and act to get what you want, not just wish and hope.    Literary fiction tries to do new things with language, including trying new things with sentence lengths.   That said, I think you are wrong this is restricted to literary fiction. Lots of genre fiction--thrillers, crime, erotica--loves chopppy sentence fragments for example thinking it adds "speed" to the text.       Getting paid to write free reviews on Goodreads/Amazon? That's... likely to be pretty unethical. People will only want to pay you to write positive reviews if you are being paid by authors and not by magazines.    Did you tell that anecdote on here yesterday? Swear I read that in another thread. I think that makes sense, but I wonder what  a class who only made 10 pots would do   Yeah, it's interesting because we tend to think that genre pays more than literary fiction, but every time I talk numbers with reddit genre writers they are getting lower advances than my literary writer friends.   Not that the latter are making bank, but the genre writers here make it sound impossible to get more than 5-10k for your first couple books while my lit friends get more than that   I guess I just think the voice of "write mediocre stuff and dont' worry too much, it can sell if you work in an formulaic niche!" drowns out others here. I really have no problem with people who want to do that, but it can be just as satisfying or even more so to get an easy job to  pay the bills and then write carefully crafted work on the side.    Yikes! And you said it was a trilogy? She was paid 2k per book by Simon and Schuster? That's nuts. That's less than most small presses pay.     He's not entirely correct about literary awards. From all the data that is available about SFF ones, it does appear that they have a minor impact on sales nowadays, as opposed to how they impaced on the genre thirty, forty years ago. There is, however, still a bump - but what he ignores is that there are awards out there that do change and authors career. The Booker, the Pulitzer, the Nobel - these all result in generous sales and a new audience coming to the author.  Totally. A big award---National Book Award, Pulitzer, Booker---can have a HUGE impact on the sales of a book, especially if it is a low selling book.   Here's an article on it: http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/awards-and-prizes/article/51573-just-how-much-does-a-pulitzer-prize-help-a-book-s-sales.html  It cites Jennifer Egan's Goon Squad more than tripling sales for several months after the win, and presumably that had a long tail effect. Paul Hardings Tinkers went from a  book only 1k people had bout to a book that's soon sold over 300k.    I guess what I mean is, I wonder if the issue---without knowing the books obviously---was less that the authors didnt' spend 10 years honing and more that they didn't build up the connections and platforms and/or put in the work to make the books a success.   Anecdotally, I lot of my friends have started pretty promising careers publishing their first books in their mid/late 20s or early 30s, but they did it smartly.   You are right that the midlist is dead though, especially for genre fiction. (For literary fiction, you can sustain a career teaching and such while selling at a midlist level and htere are presses dedicated to putting quality low selling work out.)    I read every single post on Dean Wesley Smith's site about publishing and it comes down to the same thing. Write more books.  This is generally true, but not always true.   Jonathan Franzen is one of the best selling authors in recent history (not quite JK Rowling level, but his last two novels were in the top 5 best sellers the years they came out) and he only puts out a book every few years.      Is "being paid" really the only goal though?   If you want to write and be paid, your best bet is to be prolific... writing non-fiction, probably for corporate newsletters. If you want to be paid writing fiction, your best bet is to write as quickly as possible without editing and pump out erotica.   Nothing wrong with any of that, but I think we should keep in mind that there is value to writing work that you love, editing it carefully,  rewriting, and putting something out in the world that you generally feel needs to be there.    Such a great story!   Being published young can be really bad BUT your examples were about first books selling poorly and sadly there is little relation between craft/quality and sales. If your friends shitty books had sold like Twilight or 50 Shades, no one would have dropped them      ha yeah, not sure what hte author is asking?   I get pretty bored by non-fiction books though and feel like most of the time I can glean the facts of a situation well enough from articles and essays instead of full books. Maybe that's what they mean?    I don't think most writers really write about themselves actually. We imbue different aspects of ourselves into different characters, sure, but you do that will all characters ideally. You don't just have the Mary Sue author character and a bunch of others.   Certainly some books are highly autobiographical though (Proust's In Search of Lost Time, Babel's The Red Calvary Cycle, Joyce's A Portrati of the Artist as a Young Man, etc.)                                 Loved Sisters Brothers and McCarthy, haven't read the others mentioned on this though. DeWitt has a new novel coming out soon too   I'd say persuasion has very little to do with being right. Basically nothing.   There's a reason we need fiction writers, creative non-fiction writers, and journalists to translate the "facts" of scientists, mathematicians, etc.   I think the question is impossible though since it really depends on the audience how you can persuade them. Well, maybe that's the key: know your audience.    Pretty great book! I like Trout Fishing in America even more. But In Watermelon Sugar is like legit psychedelic hippie fiction       Before anyone mentions A Song of Ice and Fire, those books have tons of characters and I'm not just talking about unexpected deaths.  Yeah, and Ned dies at the end of the book he is the "protagonist" for, not the end.                      Okay one more reply:   With **A Dance With Dragons**, the publisher announced it was mostly completed and being they were working on it on March 3rd, 2011. The book came out July 12 2011 after a huge rush from the publisher and Martin. So 4.5 months last time. Probably a good gauge.    If a book was literally 100% finished and proofread and copyedited and everything, a press could probably turn it around in 2 months. The printing process would take about a month, the shipping a week, and a few weeks to get the cover and other stuff in motion. Just a guess.    Well, in general books take a year to two years to see publication. It depends on when a publisher can fit the book in their schedule, there is more that goes into the planning than just when a book can come out quickest. Different books do well at different times, and you don't want to "compete" with similar books. So a big book of literary realism won't want to come out at the same time as a new Franzen, for example, especially if the same publisher is putting out both.   But even if there is an open slot, it normally takes a few months to edit and proof, and then typically books are sent out to reviewers as "galleys" 4 to 8 months ahead of publication. This is to build buzz for the book and to allow reviewers to turn in reviews (many magazines need reviews written and ready a few months before hand.)   **All that said...**  for a book like The Winds of Winter that will sell great no matter what there is no really need to worry about buzz or even advance reviews. AND since the publisher will want to put the book out ASAP to capture fan interest, they will slot it ASAP. So all the above concerns aren't much of a worry.  So that really means it is just a question of how long it takes Martin and his editor to do the edits, plus how long it takes to get the book printed and shipped to stores. I'd guess at least 3 months, probably more like 5.         I guess where we disagree is that this is about getting better products. Optimistically, it's about "fairness" in payouts (i.e., not letting authors scam the system). Pessimistically, it's about paying author's less.    Yep, people love to complain about "clickbait" but... it works! Quality doesn't drive eyeballs, most of the time.     Paying only for what can hold our interest will hopefully allow more differentiation among the level of quality of books I download.   Why is that your assumption? I assume the exact opposite: only the same kind of books sell really well (mass market page turner fiction is very repetitive, just like reality TV, pop music, and blockbuster films have a very narrow range  of work).   This model will probably make everyone write in the same kind of straight-forward prose, the same short cliffhanger laden chapters, etc. etc.    the barrier for entry... for the golfers? Are you saying there is too high of a barrier for entry... for readers?   There are so many options for legal free books, cheap used books, and cheap ebooks that I really don't think there is any kind of cost barrier to read books.    I think it would mainly matter because of Amazon's reputation. If their goal is to be "the everything store," and they lose a lot of ground in their prestige books division it would really hurt their reputation.       The subscription services literally doesn't sell books, it lends them on an unlimited basis (the reader fee doesn't change)... and I'm pretty sure the program is exclusive, meaning you can't sell the books elsewhere if you are in the program.   So... how do you think this will sell more books? I honestly don't understand what you think is happening.    Also, in a subscription service like this the goal is only to pay artists less. Netflix and Spotify are always trying to negotiate less payouts to artists, not "sell more music/movies"   Huh? I think you are confused here. This has nothing to do with selling more or less books. It's about how Amazon allots money in their unlimited subscription service. Before, they gave everyone the same amount of money if somene completed something like 20% of the book. Now it's all based on pages.   It's like if Netflix payed TV shows per minute watched instead of per season.   Netflix and Kindle Unlimited are subscription services with unlimited access to the content they have. They aren't selling more or less books here.    There's also just something a little insulting about only paying for what you finish, something that never happens in any other industry.   Ate a big lunch and don't finish your burger at dinner? You don't pay the restaurant half prize.   Get a call and have to leave the baseball game you attended? You don't get a refund on the last third of your stadium ticket.   Only play 3 holes at the putt-putt and get bored? You don't get your money back.   Granted this is currently just a program that doesn't encompass all that much work, but if this is a wedge meant to be moved to other programs it is really problematic.       Amazon's objective is not to sell books, per se. Their goal is to make money. If they can make more money selling other things, or giving away books for free, or ripping off author's and giving them a lower cut, they will in a heartbeat.   Also, books are less than 10% of Amazon's business. They don't really care that much how well books on the site sell.       I'd say American culture in general is anti-reading and anti-intellectual these days. Been like that for a long time, but got really ramped up during the Bush years (even from liberals)   In my personal experience, undergrad writing classes are very different from grad classes or non-school workshops. Basically, undergrad classes are filled with kids looking for "an easy A" or with just kids who are only  just starting out. Basically, not filled with serious writers so teachers can only teach so much.                                        Ebooks do this already, kinda. Ebook prices tend to start high and go low with regular deals. Things like bookbub team with publishers to do .99 cent and 1.99 deals too to boost Amazon sales ranking.       (I mean, Shakespeare's men literally performed at court for the king and the rest, they didnt' only perform at the globe)    It wasn't until late in his life that he performed for King James.  King James became the official patron in 1603, Shakespeare died in 1616. Most of Shakespeare's big plays were in that time (King Lear, MacBeth, Othello, The Tempest, etc.)  Shakespeare's first play was 14 years before King James was the patron. So 14 years before, 12 years after (for last written play.) Basically half his career was that.   But anyway, before the King was his patron the Lord Chamberlain was the patron.   Honestly, a theater crowd in a big city is not really "literally the masses." There isn't really a way to compare any artist from Shakespeare's time to modern mass entertainment. How many people do you think went to the Globe during Shakespeare's life? Surely only a fraction of the people who have purchased a Harry Potter book, listened to a Beyonce song, or watched The Avengers. (London's entire population was less than 200,000 in Shakespeare's time.) Mass culture literally didn't exist back then. The technology wasn't there to distribute it.   The Globe certainly had city dwellers attending, but Shakespeare also preformed for nobility. Certainly you can say Shakespeare wrote for both the masses and the elites, but you can't say it was only the former.     Why do people think Shakesperae only wrote for "the common man"? Dude was employed by the King, and by nobility before that. Most of his plays are about princes and kings, and many are based on historical nobility.   Yeah, he threw in a few dick jokes too, but that doesn't mean he was writing Charles Bukowski stories.    No, I mean I think that's a fairly common opinion actually.       Sure... but look, most changes authors would make are often pretty small. Like most of the time, a new "draft"---after the first few--just fixes some small errors or makes minor changes throughout.   I'm sure most authors have a few sentences they'd change or whatever, but that's not very interesting for a thread like this where people are talking more about major changes   No, it doesn't stand to reason that infinite drafts would make a work infinitely better. Many of the great works of literature were written overnight with only minor revisions (Kafka's The Judgement is one example, also Ginsberg's Howl allegedly). The draft fetishism of contemporary writing is just that, a fetish.   It's not that flaws improve a book per se, but that what many people think of as a "problem" is often what makes a book interesting. Like this thread is filled with people wanting to "fix" great books by removing what makes them unique and making them more like standard commercial fiction books.       The press that owned the book rights, I guess? Presses can often sell the rights to a book to another press, so King's contract probably had him get half of that.    Honestly, nothing for any book I like. Flaws and imperfections are part of what makes art great, honestly. Most attempts to "fix" great works would just make them more bland.       Great breakdown, seems right to me.    This is a GREAT example of why agents are important. So many people on here like to act like agents are all scam artists who never help authors. A good agent, even just an okay one, is worth their fee.   My own agent bumped my advance up enough that it covered their fee and more.                                  Hmm, not sure I agree with a lot of this.    And then they don't put bookstores everywhere.    Even at the height of the video store game, my hometown had at least as many bookstore as video stores. Now, there is only one video store (that I can think of) and still over a dozen bookstores.    The biggest difference is that almost everyone watches movies, but most people don't read.   The first stat I find says 76% of adults read at least one book in last year. That's not great, but most Americans DO read even if it is only one book a year. People certainly watch way more movies than they read books, but OTOH we are talkinga bout video rental stores. Most americans pre-Netflix era probably just watched TV and went to the cinema now and then.    not sure you can game much with ebooks. you could add more paragraph breaks to stretch pages out, but you couldn't like increase the font (the user controls that)   heh, well when the Kindle came out 8 years ago it was REALLY supposed to be the print book apocalypse... yet it hasn't happened yet.    The internet is hitting hard for sure, although I feel like people have been saying print will die for almost 10 years and the print market has actually grown I believe and even with Amazon indie bookstores have been doing pretty well in recent years.            	200

Don't let your dreams be dreams    Wow you know Ericopoly? Yeah this wasn't a bash small cap post, it's more of an anti-bash big cap one.    This isn't necessarily bashing small caps; rather it's about not bashing big caps.        I found this comment by commentor 'red' particularly insightful:  Because some revenue growth adds no value, some revenue growth even destroys value. Look it up, if you like.  The idea the revenue growth and high margins together drive value is wrong. What drives value creation is growth without a deterioration in the return on investment.  In 1989 there was strong evidence (in the 10-k) of increasing returns on investment AND growth AND the share price was at the equivalent of $10. The annual return on every additional dollar invested by Coke was 59 cents, far above its ROIC of 22%. Those circumstances represent obvious value. Obvious to anyone who cared to look and cared to think even a little about it.  In 2012, theres 9% return on every dollar of new investment, far below the ROIC of 72.8%. It can grow all it likes at 9% returns and it wont create a dime of value Besides, the shares are now not at $10 but at $79 .    *This is the relevant portion of the article, which was originally written by the user 'coc' in CBF: http://www.cornerofberkshireandfairfax.ca/forum/fairfax-financial/what-percentage-of-your-portfolio-is-in-fairfax-financial/30/*  Im surprised you all let this go. Id like to comment on two things, both of which I consider nonsense.  1. It is very easy to find securities that will outperform the market.  2. Holding Fairfax is inferior to running around finding these very easy securities.  I think investors vastly underestimate how good Warren Buffett was at his job back in the 1950s and 1960s when he was buying these niche securities. Hes even better now, but obviously runs so much capital that his returns are lower. There seems to be this Buffett envy going on in value investing circles whereby investors feel the need to look for little cigar butts similar to what Warren used to  largely influenced by his talks to students and his biography.  And yet, I have seen precious few investors who have successfully done it. Beyond the platitude that smaller areas of the market are inefficient, there are considerable risks. You are usually investing in second rate businesses that destroy value, or at least are not really building any. Often these businesses are run by inexperienced managers and have little advantage over their competitors. Thus, the business risks you assume are big ones, although most investors think a cheap valuation makes up for it. Sometimes, but not always.  Take for an example Dempster Mill Mftg  a well known Buffett investment way back when. If you think through the situation, there was a good probability that the investment was not a wise one. It took heroic efforts by a new manager to keep Dempster from going under, and even then, it was not an absolute home run. Yet, most Buffetteers admire these types of investments Warren used to make.  But what was Warrens largest partnership investment? American Express, a well known company then and now, not a micro-cap dishwasher manufacturer. He also had a successful investment in Disney, and one in GEICO, again two companies that were well known. What was probably his best stock investment at Berkshire? The Washington Post, not exactly unknown.  Yet were told that he made all of his great returns back then because he could look small. Well, as with everything in life, the answer is yes and no. I think there is a great myth that you need to look where no-one else is looking and be creative in the investment process. That you should get points for creativity or something. But the very same people propagating this myth are students of Charlie Munger, who once wrote to Wesco shareholders that We try to profit more from always remembering the obvious then grasping the esoteric.  Lets talk about a few more of Warrens home runs. Petrochina, one of the largest companies on the planet. Freddie Mac, one of the largest companies on the planet. Coca-Cola, the most well-known brand on the planet. BYD, one of Chinas most well-known and well-respected companies. These are investments where, for the first 5-10 years, he made 25%+ compound annual returns. Who are these people not getting rich by consistently generating 25% compound returns? Where is this stock market where 25% annual returns dont generate alpha? Why do small investors need to run around looking at micro-caps?  ***  Lets also look at some other legendary investors. What sort of returns did they achieve and what were they buying? Lou Simpson  20%+ type returns buying very well known companies. Rick Guerin  25% type returns investing in a pretty broad range of securities small and large. Ruane, Cunniff  15% over 40 years investing in large stocks. Eddie Lampert at ESL  you would probably know of almost every company he ever invested in  30% CAGR for a 15-20 year period. Glenn Greenberg at Chieftain  did 25% for about 20 years, again youd probably recognize almost every stock he owned.  These guys are legends, theyre all rich, and they invested in a huge range of securities.  Who do we know of that was investing in small securities that no one has heard of? Heres two: Schloss and Graham. Did either of them do 50% compounded? Hell no. Theyre hall-of-famers with 15-20% returns. Do I need to bring up Charlies returns? What has he bought over time?  So I dispute this notion that investors are somehow doing themselves a disservice by sticking with companies they know well and that others know well. Well-known companies are often just as mispriced as small ones. To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail, says Munger. Yet the Buffetteers seem to only admire one tool for finding cheap stocks (size constraints), when myopia, ignorance, and a host of other biases are just as powerful in creating misvalued securities.  To wrap this up a little, Im not saying there arent lots of small mispriced stocks. Buffett did very well with them, and there are probably others doing great, too. But recognize two things: 1. Huge CAGRs are really, really hard. 2. You can do extremely well investing in larger companies, great companies, and well-known companies, without a lot of the risks of investing in broken-down nags. This is well proven.  So if you rationally evaluate Fairfax and come to the conclusion that youre going to get 15-20%+ CAGR (eminently reasonable given the fact that they are a relatively small player in a gigantic global insurance market and are run by one of the smarter investment teams on the planet), dont worry about how much alpha youre not generating by looking elsewhere. Was it a mistake to invest in Berkshire when it had a billion dollar market cap and was well known? I repeat, there are no points for creativity. Dont forget it takes a unique cast of mind to just sit on some great companies and compound at high rates with no taxes, professional investor or not.  Im probably not going to convert anyone who believes strongly that they have to be looking in the dirty alleys for cheap stocks, but if youre on the fence, hopefully this is food for thought.    *This is the relevant portion of the article, which was originally written by the user 'coc' in CBF: http://www.cornerofberkshireandfairfax.ca/forum/fairfax-financial/what-percentage-of-your-portfolio-is-in-fairfax-financial/30/*  Im surprised you all let this go. Id like to comment on two things, both of which I consider nonsense.  1. It is very easy to find securities that will outperform the market.  2. Holding Fairfax is inferior to running around finding these very easy securities.  I think investors vastly underestimate how good Warren Buffett was at his job back in the 1950s and 1960s when he was buying these niche securities. Hes even better now, but obviously runs so much capital that his returns are lower. There seems to be this Buffett envy going on in value investing circles whereby investors feel the need to look for little cigar butts similar to what Warren used to  largely influenced by his talks to students and his biography.  And yet, I have seen precious few investors who have successfully done it. Beyond the platitude that smaller areas of the market are inefficient, there are considerable risks.

You shift your perspective from expecting initial rates of returns to good earnings growth. As long as the latter is high enough, it doesn't matter that the former is poor (to a certain extent). Of course, they have to be reliable as well, which is where your moats, desirable rates of return and margin of error come in.    The Ebony Throne         Just see Goodwill as another capital expense. As long as the return on asset is satisfactory for physical+intangible assets, it's usually fine.

How do you check the times for frequent locations?         \#FIREKT   Wake up sheeple.   Basically you have no chance compared to someone who actually has a finance degree. You want to have something on your resume which will actually get your foot in the door in the bigger banks or boutiques.   The best way to do that would be to have some experience as an analyst. Most junior level credit analyst jobs involves stuff you've already learned getting your CPA, so you're definitely capable. You just want to get some credibility so that the banks will actually look at you.   So go to a small shop who usually can't afford the 100k IB salary, offer to work for half of that, then add it to your resume six months later and apply at a bank. Most of these jobs usually have very long probation periods (6 months) built in because they expect you to jump ship before then. Once you have a 6 month stint on your resume, the banks will actually give you a glance.    It's more about supply and demand than any notion of a standard rate. If it's too low, walk away. If she thinks it's not worth it, you won't convince her.    Literally applied on a whim on their website and got it. Having passion for it and a willingness to accept lower pay probably helped.

Basically, the investment banks do all the calculations, then they hire KPMG to do all the heavy lifting (e.g. effecting all the operational changes, informing an army of foreign labor they've just been let go, dealing with bribery, etc.). So yes, it was technically 'Restructuring', but you don't actually do any of the math stuff. It's basically like what an audit junior is to 'Audit'.

He used to work as a bellboy.      True, but the character's base stats heavily favored one role so most people didn't bother switching. You'll find very few STR Rinoa's or DEF Lulu's. Whereas experimentation of jobs was a key trait in earlier games; the fact that Lvl 99 Onion Knights were an achievement shows that jobs were meant to be a deep part of the game's foundations.   It's either revolutionary or rebellious. It changed a lot of the traditional aspects that fanboys had grown up with (e.g. no victory theme for regular battles) and felt entitled to. And the character development of the main character was basically non-existent. However it had an extremely rich plot, extremely well fleshed out battle system and the game world was almost MMORPG sized. You can literally spend over 1000 hours in it and not finish every side quest.   The other gripe by fanboys was that it went back to the original FF styles before the gripe-y nature of FF7, so those who learned about Final Fantasy after 7 naturally felt it wasn't very "Final Fantasy". Up to today, the FF camp can be split evenly between the old boys and the new boys - with the old boys preferring mana casting, job switching, fairy tale escapism; while the new boys prefer fixed roles per character, over-the-top flashiness and gritty realism.   If you've never played a FF game before though, you'll be sure to like it as you'll be coming in without any biases.    No 9 is a throwback to the original games BEFORE FF7. That's why it was so controversial to the youngins who only got in after 7.   This is exactly the rig I used to emulate XII a few years back.

 I absolutely love mine. I use it daily to cover my under-eye circles and my quite red nose. I use the shade Vanilla and use it under the Nars powder foundation (Deauville) and it lasts all day without creasing.   I would recommend putting it on in stages and working fairly quickly. If you let it sit too long on your skin before blending it can get wonky.    I would recommend going to Sephora or another makeup store that has a good reputation. I then wait to ask a SA that has foundation that looks good. Then I ask them for help.   The other factor that I had to overcome is speaking up when a foundation isn't what you want. If it doesn't look right on your skin, say so. They will bee understanding and try again.   I THIRD this recommendation - I'm actually glad you have the link because I got these as a stocking stuffer at Christmas and I LOVE them. They work really, really well.    I think this is an amazing tutorial by MonsiieurAlex on applying blush: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq_IRULlz4w  He is gearing it specifically towards red blush but it applies to any shade. It is perfect for highly pigmented blushes (think Nars, Tarte, etc). It really revolutionized the way that I apply blush - even with bright/bold shades you have a refined and polished look.   I am an art curator and my colleagues and I had the wonderful opportunity to see an advanced screening of The Monuments Men last night. I thought it was delightfully entertaining and did a tremendous job of getting people to care about art. So, thanks. I hope you enjoyed portraying my profession, albeit in a far more dramatic time.   Well, I can vouch for the trains in Japan (at least in the Osaka area). If a train is even slightly delayed the board will show how many minutes behind it is and when you disembark if it has been late longer than a few minutes, they'll give you a slip as you pass through the turnstile.   I got a Target coupon the other day for this - I was excited before but now I'm SUPER JAZZED   Having once been a poor teenager myself, keep an eye out for 2 for 1 deals. I occasionally see them at Target for CoverGirl mascaras. Its a fantastic deal, just keep the second tube sealed until you need it!    I was going to say the same thing about the mascara - I would suggest getting a new tube. You'd probably have more volume and less clumping of your lashes. I love the way you created this - I like seeing each step!   What area of town would it be in?   The high pigmented matte pencils? I do love the colors but I haven't tried that formula. I do, however, love the Cashmere lip cream - it lasts all day for me.   I've always noticed it too - I'm sure the main reason is not verisimilitude but a more interesting shot. It's way more compelling to see people moving and different situations than just two people sitting at table. And especially if you're a crime show where you are constantly questioning people, it would make for some pretty static television.    Word. My chow absolutely refuses to come inside when it snows, its the climate he was bred for and he absolutely loves it.   In the United States, if you donate art you can get:  * An immediate income tax deduction * Avoidance of the tax on capital gains on appreciated assets * An estate and gift tax deduction  I believe there are similar incentives in other countries.   On the museum side of things, it is a form of income, and therefore is valid to their taxes. But it is also important for them to have an accurate understanding of value for insurance.   TL;DR: Tax write-offs   I'm not familiar with the laws and regulations in Slovenia but many countries do have [laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_trove) requiring finds to be made known to the government. Typically, if the government is interested in keeping the find, the finder is compensated monetarily.   Even if Slovenia doesn't have this sort of regulation, it is wise to have it appraised. Typically though, a reputable museum would require you to have an appraisal before a gift was made (for tax reasons - both yours and the museums).    What a great opportunity for you to educate him otherwise! And if still feels that way he can go fuck himself!   I think this is a really beautiful "no makeup" look - I think a little pop of color would had a lot of punch! You have such lovely skin tone I think you would look gorgeous with a dark lip   I will say, I think you're 'everyday look' brings polish to your look - you definitely look gorgeous either way though.   Ha, I make sure that the label isn't facing out - no matter what it is or what I use it for - Monistat just makes people think of yeasty vagoos.   PREACH   Needlepoint/Cross-stitch is pretty great too. You can get all the materials for quite cheap and a project can really last a while! I've worked on some for years on end. It's not super hard either - so it's perfect to do while watching tv or a movie.   You're most welcome!   As for getting color matched, the service is indeed free! Just be honest with them, I've never felt pressure when I was up front about my intentions. A sales person at Sephora or a department store will understand the importance of figuring out how a foundation wears throughout the day and not in the first five minutes you have it on. Just the other day I went to test some products in order to make a wish list for Christmas. I told this to the salesperson at the start, and she was very helpful in picking out products, colors and application. If you feel nervous still, say something like, "Hi, I've never used a whole lot of makeup, but I'm interested in getting a foundation but I have no idea where to start. I want light to medium coverage and my price range is $xx-xx. Could you help me get color matched and find some options? Since I'm so new to this, I would really like to test one or two out before I commit."   As for your brows, too bad about the Brow Bar! I've heard great things about it - but I actually only had my brows shaped once and I have just maintained them since. Maybe ask among your friends if anybody has a person they trust? And yes, typically if you have long hairs I just take tiny scissors (the same I use for my nails) and I just trim them.   I also forgot to mention that it might help you to have some basic make up brushes. The ELF brushes are very affordable and will be better than the small applicators that will come with makeup. To start out I would recommend a brush for blush and two eyeshadow (one for blending - the package will probably use this as a descriptor).   No. 12 Corail Fauve is my jaaaam!   As for your skin - I would say that you probably have combination skin. Do you have a typical routine? Perhaps consider getting into a basic skin care routine. Start out with basic cleanser (I actually just use plain [Neutrogena glycerine soap](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Original-Formula-Soap-Ounce/dp/B000052YLL/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8 qid=1387228154 sr=8-3 keywords=neutrogena+glycerin+soap) which retails at $5 or less) as well as a moisturizer. Some that many people like are [Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream Fragrance Free Moisturizer](http://www.amazon.com/Olay-Regenerist-Micro-Sculpting-Cream-Ounce/dp/B0012J30LY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1387228237 sr=8-1 keywords=Olay+Regenerist+Micro+Sculpting+Cream+Fragrance+Free+Moisturizer) (Retails around $22, I personally use this and love it. I have skin more on the dryer side of combination) or [Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer](http://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Positively-Radiant-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B001IM5VT4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1387228270 sr=8-2 keywords=Aveeno+Positively+Radiant+Daily+Moisturizer) (retails at around $15). Feel free to experiment though. Try using both at least daily - see how your skin feels after about a week or so.   In addition to this face care - I would recommend getting an eye makeup remover if you are planning on wearing any kind of eye makeup. I think the [Up and Up brand at Target](http://www.target.com/p/up-up-makeup-remover-5-5-oz/-/A-11573878#prodSlot=medium_1_1 term=Up+and+Up+makeup+remover) is fantastic. Use this with some cotton pads or even TP, and it will be much much gentler on your eyes than just soap.   Since you have typically not used a lot of makeup I'm assuming that you would not be so keen on a full coverage foundation. You have quite nice skin so you can definitely use something on the lighter side. A great concealer that many people like is the [Hard Candy Glamoflauge Concealer](http://www.amazon.com/Hard-Candy-Glamoflauge-CONCEALER-pencil/dp/B009Z3MG0K/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8 qid=1387228376 sr=8-3 keywords=hard+candy+glamoflauge+concealer) (retails Around $8.50). If you want more coverage, perhaps [Cover Girl Clean Foundation](http://www.amazon.com/CoverGirl-Sensitive-Liquid-Makeup-Bottles/dp/B003FBRVCQ/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8 qid=1387228411 sr=8-6 keywords=Cover+Girl+Clean+Foundation) is quite nice ($5-6). I personally feel more comfortable with more coverage and I am willing to splurge for something that works really well for me. If you feel you might like something more - consider going to [Sephora and getting color matched](http://www.sephora.com/color-iq). Then test more than one and ask for samples. Don't buy on the spot - see how it feels and looks throughout the day, then buy.   In terms of blush, I would try the [Nyx Powder Blush](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod3020029#). I think the Mocha or Desert Rose shade would be really nice with your coloring.   I think your brows look fantastic - you may want to have them very slightly shaped. [Benefit Brow Bar](http://www.benefitcosmetics.com/brand/boutiqueoverview/browbars) can help - they are typically pretty great. It doesn't look like you need to fill them in at all. If you want to have them held in place consider a clear wax, but it may not be necessary.   Eyeshadow and eyeliner can really help your eyes pop from behind glasses. [Maybelline Eye Studio gel liner](http://www.amazon.com/Maybelline-Studio-Lasting-Eyeliner-Blackest/dp/B0030HNNS6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1387228796 sr=8-1 keywords=maybelline+eye+studio+gel+eyeliner) is crazy fantastic but it might be above your skill level if you're not used to lining your eyes. It comes in a small pot with a brush. It is wonderfully opaque and I find a lot easier than liquid eyeliner. If you would prefer a pencil eyeliner, consider [NYX Slide On Eyes pencils](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod3490137 _requestid=394187#). Feel free to have fun with eyeshadows - I think you can get some fun shades from both [ELF](http://www.target.com/p/e-l-f-studio-geometric-eyeshadow-palette-36-pc-glam/-/A-14653350#prodSlot=large_1_11 term=Elf) or [Wet 'n' Wild](http://www.target.com/p/eye-shadow-380b-ic-13oz-eggshell/-/A-13966411#prodSlot=medium_1_27 term=wet+n+wild) and they are super cheap. Mascara - I think [Cover Girl Clump Crusher](http://www.target.com/p/covergirl-lashblast-clump-crusher-mascara/-/A-14293835#prodSlot=medium_1_32 term=Cover+Girl+) (green tube) is some of the best. You have really gorgeous brown eyes - I would consider some subtle green tones, or even shimmery brown neutrals.   As for not rubbing eyes - a lot of self control! When you get an itch - try delicately using the tip of your fingernail.  I hope this helps! I tried to cover the basics - there is of course more you can get into, but this is a good place to start. Check out the sidebar on the MakeupAddiction page - it may help you further.      I have perpetually dry skin but it is much worse in the midwestern winter. Are you using any kind of exfoliate? That is what has revolutionized my skin. I use the **Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Peel** which I call Black Magic Face Pads. They are not cheap but they are worth every penny. I use them daily in winter and usually every other day in the summer months. I follow up with any moisturizer - I've been using **Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream** recently, but I have used others in the past. The great thing about the Black Magic Pads is that it really *fixes* your dryness. I can wear *any* foundation.    I *love* the YSL Glossy Stains. I just got one for my birthday - they are my go-to lip colors!   These are fantastic! I've been doing another playthrough on 1999 Mode and have gotten a bit stuck - I think this is just the motivation I need to power through!   Oh most certainly - I guess I've just seen it manifest itself in troubling ways there.   Mine broke a few weeks in - it came off in one piece though - so I can put it back in its position. I then just lift it out and use either side.    [Ugggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh](http://imgur.com/UH7RPYF) This stuff is Tumblr gold and it is so depressing. Its common with the extrovert vs. introvert dichotomy too - there's a ton of comics, etc. that portray introverts as beautifully misunderstood intellectuals who just want to read and extroverts as piggish idiots.   I personally don't want to be defined by a stereotype and I embrace my idiosyncrasies.  I am an extrovert. I am a librarian. I am a Makeup Addict. These aren't contradictions.    I really love that lip color - do you have a product list?  Also, I love your username :)  	31
  The Family?   Thanks for this response I think I will apply in 3rd year for training contracts with my LPC funded. I had gotten so caught up in thinking about what I would do when I finished 3rd year that I had forgotten that I'd receive help applying etc in my third year.    Thanks this has been a great insight!   Thanks, did you get your LPC funded by a training contract? Is it common for it to be funded by the training contract?    Touching the void?    It's a lovely idea but I'm already sorted housing wise for next year and it sadly isn't practical for me to just hop countries for a year.   Thanks for your reply though.    I'm currently a second year law student plodding my way through my degree.   I know that I want to do my Law Practicing Course (LPC) once I finish my three years and then move onto a training contract. But, I also want a year out to live in News Zealand.   Would I be best having a year out and then do my LPC which would hopefully be funded through a training contract? Or would I be best doing my LPC straight away after these 3 years and then have a year out and then go onto a training contract? The downside to the latter is that I would have to fund the 10,000 LPC myself.   How common is it that training contracts fund LPCs?   Any help/comments/sharing of own experiences would be great.

 lol, how many websites have you used? If they were actually "designed with the users in mind" i gotta think most sites would be way different than they are.   i dunno, kids apparently mentally ill and just became obsessed with islam. I'm just glad he didn't blow anyone up.    Alexander Ciccolo's father alerted authorities last fall that his son had a long history of mental illness and was talking about joining the Islamic State group  A father doing it right: he saw his son was headed down a bad path, and took steps to keep him from hurting people. If more parents did that, it'd be a better world.      They don't want anyone getting worked up over anything that ain't the superbowl or the latest reality TV craze. Might demand some change, then, and we can't be having that.       What a load of horseshit. They don't give a fuck about this guy getting a "fair trial" (whatever that would even mean considering he's confessed and admits his guilt), they care about not further stirring up the public.      Must have been nightmarish. She's a tough kid to hike out after that sort of thing.      I gotta say if my favorite author reached out to me on social media and said "hey leave a good review of this book" that i hadn't read, i'd happily go hammer one out.   This is probably a good thing, is what i'm tryin' to say.   A good question, for sure. I'm guessing not.   Working under a car on ramps or jackstands. I try to be safe, but shit does happen.   My brother came within about 6 inches of a car falling on him. It was absolutely terrifying, there was no warning, and it came down so fast that there'd have been nothing i could have done had it happened.  Definitely a wakeup call to be a little safer about having a car up on a jack.    I thought about linking that, but it's so long that i wasn't sure if people'd like it, rather than just a quick overview. But it's a VERY good read and very involved in how they were recovered and thoughts about it, etc.    One would hope. Totally senseless loss of life.    Puts me in a mind of the [German Tourist story](http://www.thelocal.de/20091114/23273) -  a family of german tourists who went into the death valley and weren't found for over a decade.    Whoot, victory by lowest denominator! Thanks for the gold, man!    I gotta say: someone shoots 4 normal people, it's huge fucking news. Some shithead drag-racer with an inferiority complex kills 4 people and it's a footnote.         I cannot even imagine the horror and awfulness that must have been for both of them. It's a borderline miracle she survived, and it's a tragedy her husband didn't.       What a fucking embarrassment texas is. Maybe we should invade them and replace their existing (evidently mentally deranged and possibly glue-sniffing) government with one staffed by sane adults.  Also, why the fuck is chuck norris still relevant? the guy's a punchline of jokes for middle-schoolers.      Indeed so.   the basic story of the casey anthony case is that there's only circumstantial evidence, hearsay, and "feelings" to determine her guilt. It was never a very solid case. Why the prosecutors insisted on going forward is beyond me, unless the ghouls on fox news pushed them to it.    What the fuck does that have to do with terrorism?    Presented because this sequence of events makes so little sense as to be either a truly senseless crime, or one with much more to it than what has been presented.      It's a pretty pervasive attitude on reddit that if it ain't america, it's a paradise. And, oddly, a lot of borderline china-worship every time china comes up in a post.    more like "And then have another boston marathon bombing and have everyone wonder why they didn't get caught first".   If the FBI could turn them into bombers, then some genuine radicals could have done the same. I don't have any problem with the FBI's terror investigations in that regard.   I gotta say, doubt of the forensic science is about 90% of why i think Casey Anthony is innocent. When the best the prosecution has is some dodgy mechanical nose and a couple of internet searches, that's not proof of anything.    that's actually a perfectly valid plan - just find a trench and dump'em in weighted down. Even if it only sequestered the carbon for a while, it'd be better than our current policy of doing jack-all.   So's saying we should abolish the death penalty because it costs to much.   Mental illness, would be my guess. Something wrong with how her brain works.   ...tried to think of something pithy to say, came up blank. My hat tips to you, sir.   I wondered that too, actually. At least the mother kept an eye on it.   Since cost is apparently now the single most important factor of justice, we should just start housing criminals in tents out in the forest or something, and make them scavenge for food.   I mean, if it saves a single nickle of taxes, then that's totally what we should do, right?   One of the more-plausible methods of carbon sequestration is to grow trees and then bury them deep underground where they won't decay, locking away the carbon. This could facilitate that (Just hit'em with a huge dose of radiation before you send them down).   If it were 4 million, i would say "perhaps the game is beginning to get the recognition it deserves"; if it were 40 million, i would say "maybe, people are starting to really pay attention". If it were 400 million, i would be ecstatic that so many lives had been touched. And if it were 4 billion? I'd finally think "That's the recognition it deserves, finally!"   Keep growing and stay awesome, /r/dwarffortress !    Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo      My brother's fond of saying that humans never change, only our tools do. We're still the same as we've ever been - we just got better documentation, now.   I just liked the incredible specificity of the news report. It's not lube, it's strawberry-flavored warming lube.    Probably evidence.   I kind of divide these cases into two camps:  1. People who are remotely understandable. They go after a 16 or 17 year old, and there's some kid of rational thought process involved.  2. People who are incomprehensible. Going after an 11 year old when you're 45 is just impossible for me to understand. There's no rationale there.  Either way damage is done to the young person, but in the second case it can be totally awful.   In this case, the parent noticed text communications on the boy's phone, and contacted authorities.          I'd just like to say that i think having a grave in the middle of a park is fucking bizarre and creepy. Put the dude in a cemetery where he belongs, not a public park.    I can do you one better: thanks to stephen king, i won't even get NEAR a garbage disposal. He put me off'em for life.    Oh man that is awful.   Dude's from fucking Michigan, and from a nice town in Michigan, at that. He's no more an authentic southerner than he is an authentic martian.       Fair point   No, it's all of our problem. He's gonna get sick, and then what? he's gonna miss work. he's going to be using up healthcare resources (which he may or may not pay for). Every dollar he spends on healthcare unnecessarily is money he can't spend on the real economy.   This asshole giving himself food poisoning is, in fact, something that affects many more people than himself.   Don't see why not, although it'd probably be best to do it in a different location.   It's actually a pretty neat video, although i don't approve of it's glamorization of suicide.   One can hope. It's a serious problem, and i wager almost everyone knows someone who's either a hoarder or a borderline hoarder. My uncle was.   I don't approve of making light of a tragedy, but i can only imagine that was one hellish, awful environment for everyone concerned. Hoarding 24 cats in a mobile home is absolutely appalling.    I was mildly surprised to see this image referenced in Taylor Swift's "Bad Blood" video; but i suppose it's so iconic that it's not overly shocking it turns up all kinds of places.    Yep. Place is just conspiracy v.2, most of the time.    Yet another loss to the horror author community. Been a bad few years.  Condolences to his family and friends :(      Indeed so. The strongest tool - aside from direct forensic evidence - is community involvement. If people say what they saw, say what they know, approach the police with information - that solves crimes faster than almost anything else.   I think it would have been MORE successful with a female protagonist, honestly. Everyone i've known who liked harry potter didn't really like harry all that much, and it was all about the supporting cast, anyway.    Typically, throwing more cops at a case won't solve it faster. What's most important is good forensic evidence gathering, good interviews with witnesses, and good contacts within the community.   With a lot of these unresolved cases, there's no forensics, no witnesses, and no leads. That just leaves waiting for someone in the community to do the right thing, and that *assumes* someone in the community knows what happened in the first place.    A well deserved milestone. I look forward to when we break 10 million!   Considering the rampant poverty in ohio, I'm not surprised he'd take a more humanitarian stance on the issue.   Damn straight. If game devs want my money, they earn it. There's hundreds upon hundreds of games out there that would happily take my time and money instead.   If robocraft thrives and continues to be fun? I'll keep playing it. If it dies out or stops being fun? I'll stop playing it. Either way, no tears from me.   Nostalgia is the retreat of those afraid of change.    I'm sure their sad he's dead, but i'm just glad he didn't kill anyone else before he died. Guy sounded positively deranged.    I don't have a like, moral issue with it, but i do find it totally inexplicable. Also, probably incredibly disgusting to actually view or partake in.   There's more words than these, gunslinger.  On a more serious note: if robocraft can't keep playerbase and can't stay in business, that's a statement that the ecology of gaming is working perfectly. A better game will rise up to replace the niche it leaves behind.    To see someone who had such a position of power abuse it in such a *hideous* way is especially disgusting.   culling the weak and leaving the strong. I like it.      what would *any sane person* do? I mean i tried to imagine the thought process that lead to such a notion and just came up blank. How would one even begin to think "man, what we need to do is kick a dead squid around on a tarp!"    i would certainly say it's disgusting, and probably unhygienic.                Be careful what you wish for, is a good motto to live by. These assholes wanted a rabid base that'd tear into the opposition no matter what reason, sense, and reality told them. They got it.  And now Trumps' going to probably pile-drive any chance the republicans had in '16 into the dirt.    The one thing the Olsens aren't is stupid. If i had the leverage to demand immunity before speaking, i would to.         Giving in to the demands of the mob is a risky proposition. On the one hand, it may satisfy the mob; on the other it may *drive them to greater depravity* to get ever more demands met.  We'll see which happens, here.    makes sense, certainly. And if the player character's aren't nearly superhuman like Roland, then it wouldn't be appropriate to have them be *super great* with guns.    It's baffling why someone would name a town after someone's first name and not even put a modifier in there. It's like having a town named Shelby or a town named Tim or something.       that is correct, videos used to be really expensive.    At sufficient speed, an impact with water is the same as an impact with concrete. he likely hit the water and got some bruising from that, and from being dragged out of the water, especially if he was resisting (or got banged up by the river bottom).  Personally, i could give a shit less why he's damaged, so long as he's fit to stand trial and carry out his sentence.    Weakest link in security is always the humans involved, and they are where i would look for fault, if the FBI's version of events doesn't make sense.   Of course. His goal is to appeal to people to get some asses back in the pews and some coins clinking into the collection plate; he knows as well as anyone does that there isn't any easy solutions or quick fixes to the world's problems.    I dunno, if Youtube can survive it, i'm sure reddit could, too.  Of course, alot of that comes down to what someone uses the site for. If they intend to post uplifting news and comment on "who's the nicest person of the year?" threads, that's one thing. If they want to talk about how their blasting heroin and then working as a highschool teacher - that's another matter.   [You'd Be Surprised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Vatican_employee_sex_scandal)   Gotta say, ain't no language looks as pretty written out as spanish. For whatever reason, it just looks appealing in print.  And thanks for the translation!    Well, i'm sure the pope'll tap into the church coffers to help out the native american people who are around today, right? Least he can do, after all...   Honestly it's the best thing that Bush could have said...for the democratic cause.    Oddly enough my first thought was that the world of the gunslinger would probably slot in almost perfectly with regular gurps, and require very few (if any) custom rules.   A lot of the in universe stuff is purely fluff, with no in-game effects beyond the needs of the story. The Beams, the Ka-Tet - that's all just window dressing.  the universe hopping is trivial enough to set up with basic gurps rules (or be a purely narrative event). Rarely do the characters have any control over the more mystical events.  The rest of the stuff would just be setting up the various races, figuring out just *how* good the gun characters are (are they as god as nearly-god Roland, or are they merely skilled gunsmen?), and what kind of equipment they have.  I might house rule stuff about ammunition and supplies (since that's such a big part of the books) but beyond that i don't see any reason in particular to not just go with basic set + gun fu and maybe High Tech/ultratech (albeit the high-tech artifacts would be hyper-rare).         Indeed so. Hopefully there's some solid forensics or other evidence to lead to some kind of justice and closure for the family.             I'd not be surprised at all; but when their imaginary friends start demanding sacrifices, that's an issue.   They are pretty neat.    And the kicker is: the gun used was stolen from a federal agent's car. Ain't no gun control on earth that would have stopped this crime.   Appalachian trail is 100% amazing.   Must concur. First time we went to applebees our (awesome) server recommended them, and we loved them so much we gave him the rest of the gift card + 10$ as a tip.   Pop tarts are a borderline superfood for situations like a hurricane:  1. they keep forever and are sealed in air-tight packaging  2. They taste decent (very important consideration)  3. They are enormously dense in calories  4. They are small in size   5. Cheap  if i had to stock my house with one food, it'd be poptarts, just because it'd give you the energy to keep going until you got somewhere that had real food and better chances.   most tragedies are the combination of bad luck, poor choices, and lack of foresight. That said, this one seems particularly avoidable.                   The CDC define [mental illness](http://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/basics.htm) as:   Mental illness is defined as collectively all diagnosable mental disorders or health conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with distress and/or impaired functioning.  If some guy's fucking a corpse, that's a mental illness. Just because it's also a personality disorder (or whatever trendy bullshit the shrinks are saying now adays), does not mean it's not also a mental illness.  Also, the legal definition of insanity in terms of competency for trial is a totally separate issue from mental health. A person can be mentally healthy, but be found to have been out of control (due to a reaction to drugs, for example) at the time of a commission of a crime. It has more to do with how the person perceived the act they committed, rather than if they have a mental illness.       yeah, i consider 3X3 or 5X5 to be the prefect bedroom size to cut down on tantrums, look decent, etc. Once you get'em all engraved there's almost never any problems.    he was diagnosed as mentally ill, but in a more general sense, from [the murderpedia page](http://murderpedia.org/male.C/c/chase-richard.htm):    When he had finished, he carved the corpse open and removed several of her internal organs, using a bucket to collect the blood and then taking it in the bathroom to bathe in it. He then sliced off her nipple and drank her blood, using an empty yogurt container as a drinking glass  That is not the behavior of *anyone* who's operating with a working brain. A sane person might kill another person, but they wouldn't engage in that kind of activity.    at the time, i gave him some credit for using a scalpel-like object instead of scissors or something. This guy was not very bright.    There's a bunch more videos on youtube from the same era by the same people.   It's a pretty interesting insight into that period of time and what they considered important to pass on in terms of training and attitude.    Here's a 1993 video by FLETC on [the Use of Force Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5pfcxg9aqI)      My dogs, too, have some kind of unholy love for paper towel and toilet paper rolls. The only thing my rott likes better is sticks.    It's not a joke, but it's a story, it has a joke in it, and other people thought it was funny at the time.  So i went to school in a pretty shitty rural area. My graduating class was like 40 people. "Judgmental" does not begin to describe the environment; every thing you did or said could and would be gossiped about.   Almost every guy i knew had a circumcised dick. Just how it was. It was such a common thing that we didn't even think about it or consider it.   So finally one day in 10th grade this dude - real hillbilly motherfucker - changes in gym class, and we see that he's *not* circumcised. For the next week, he was so tormented, so nightmarishly abused and mocked that he did the only thing he could do.  He circumcised his own prick, in his bathroom, with an x-acto knife.  There was blood on the *ceiling*. Of course he botched it and had to go to the hospital. He dropped out of school and, so far as i am aware, never graduated.  So the funny part, after the school hears about his desperate act we have a good chuckle at his expense, including mock re-enactments and tormenting his cousins about it. And then someone says:  "He HAD a freak dick, but now i bet he's got a *Frankenstein dick*!"  Cue laughter from all in attendance, and questions to his (female) cousin if she saw his "Frankenstein dick".   Edit: Thanks for the Gilding!    Ironically the only people i know who *actually* drink tears are dacryphiles, and they all prefer women's tears.    why not both?   It's certain that he was mentally ill - no one does the shit he does without being mentally ill.   But he choose to not seek help, to not turn himself in, etc. That speaks that he was - to use a turn of phrase i'm not fond of - evil.   A well deserved accolade for an awesome community!   i like the cleaning supplies right next to the redhot sauce.    The theft of law enforcement weapons is an on-going issue. I'd like a full investigation into:   1. How was the weapon secured in the car?  2. Why was the weapon left unattended in the car?  3. What condition was the car in?  4. What efforts were made to track down the thieves?  Because someone, somewhere, 100% fucked up, and i want to know who and i want to know *how*.    i have often found that having some nice, well-engraved walls is the difference between a fort falling to tantrums and a fort that just chugs forward.  Plus it's neat to see what the dwarves engrave.   Basing match on level would pretty much *vaporize* seal clubbing.   People join gangs for as many reasons as there are people in gangs, but it usually boils down to:  1. Respect. People feel that by joining a gang, they'll have the respect of the people around them.   2. Safety. It may be safer to be in a gang than to be on your own, in some high-gang activity areas.  3. Money. Gangs often are engaged in illegal business and make lots of money (or so they'd have you believe)  4. Power. Being in a gang you can have power over "the little people" around you.   5. Family/friends involved. If your older brother's in a gang, it may seem like a good idea for you to join, too.   That said, life in gangs is often brutish, unpleasant, very dangerous, and often ends up in little more than someone going to prison, getting shot, or having a lifetime of regrets. It's a bad deal.   If a large monster makes it into the workshop area, then the situation has gotten far, far out of control already.    The republican party's showing signs of fracturing. If that happens, it's absolutely fucking superb: it'll further hurt the odds of there EVER being another George Bush in office for the foreseeable future.  I'll accept almost anything as a suitable trade-in for that.   Man, the republicans should just forfeit 2016 now and save themselves the embarrassment, take the election cycle to clean house.   If this keeps up it's gonna be a landslide win for the democrats.   It's good to see baltimore trying to fix it's problems, and taking steps forward. That said, i dunno that firing one guy's gonna make all that much difference.       I legitimately don't know what should be done. I mean if someone wants to be a bad person and do something like this, over and over again, it seems like only incarceration will work to curb their behavior.     I would guess. If you're getting so boozed you fall asleep at a stoplight, that's not a sign of proper drinking habits and moderation.      just a friendly reminder who you're sharing the roads with: it's something i always think about when i'm in a car.      Brutal :(    Yep. sooner these people learn consequences, the better for everyone in their community.   I could give a shit less about animals; i treat any animal that's not a pet as vermin because they are vermin.  I care a *great deal* about people engaging in sociopathic behavior where they hurt helpless things. Today's guy who beats a turtle to death with a baseball bat is tomorrow's guy who beats his infant to death for crying too loud or smacks his wife around for not having dinner done on time.       He was born July first, 1899 - so that would  put him at around 116 years old. I don't think he'd be whipping much.    You know, every time i hear of an event like this, i wonder: how many times through history has this happened? Like, some new group of bandits or whatever show up and level some (at the time) ancient structure?   I mean i guess it's why there's not many really old buildings left around, but still.   	150
    Quite misleading that the tags are "TOP ITALIAN MOVIES" and "ITALIAN MOVIES". Also, I don't know if movies like Eat Pray Love (2010) and Angels   Demons (2009) should be called classic movies at all.   Thumbs up. Great and beautiful film by Mizoguchi, one of his best ones.   I wouldn't say that I hate his movies, I mostly just dislike them. Of course, there are directors that are much, much worse. In my opinion, Nolan doesn't really know how to tell with pictures, which is his biggest problem. That's something I have stated before. He usually explains too much, especially using voice-over and/or dialogue, just to take an example. That makes his movies very empty. He doesn't seem to know how to be subtle. For me, to be overly clear about everything isn't something good, it doesn't leave much to the viewer. Therefore, his movies tend to be superficial as hell. I've never been a big fan of him.   Modern Times (1936), Safety Last! (1923), The General (1926), Duck Soup (1933), and Mon oncle (1958) are some examples. Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, the Marx brothers, and Tati are some names that were and still are very important to comedy films overall.   Some of my absolute favourite movies in that list. I love how he admired films by Teshigahara, Bergman, Mizoguchi, Antonioni and Bresson, some of my favourite directors as well as himself, heh. Tarkovsky had great taste!   Not that I care about the movie that much, but this poster looks much better than the original one, which is quite ugly:    http://www.imdb.com/media/rm124909312/tt0478970      Don't you mean July?   I'm doing this myself, just not that super actively. Anyways, a random order is probably the easiest, because you get a little bit more diversity that way, and it's harder to get tired of the project overall. But it all depends on yourself. If a director doesn't have that many films in the collection, then it could be helpful and easier to watch those in a row, for example. Or if you want to have a certain director's films close to eacher to compare etc. I don't think there's a right or wrong answer.      If you go to ICheckMovies, you can order the Criterion list by release year, runtime and a bit of other choices. That can maybe be helpful too:      https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/the+criterion+collection/      You have the official site and the Wikipedia page to help you as well:     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Criterion_Collection_DVD_and_Blu-ray_releases      You should! Actually, it's being released on Blu-ray by Criterion Collection in about a week.  Here's a review that came up some weeks ago:    http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Hiroshima-mon-amour-Blu-ray/103958/      The restoration/transfer looks amazing. It scored a full 5.0 rating on video, audio and even the extras. The Criterion sale Barnes   Noble are having is starting any day soon, which means 50% on everything from the collection, I am so buying this! If you want to get your hands on it, this is a great opportunity, just a tip!   2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) would be a great choice to start with.   As I said, it was a while ago I read it, so I can't say that I remember too much of it. I remember that I didn't have any problem with it at least. If I recall it correctly, I think I liked the beginning of the book the most, before Red and the others actually went into the zone. I'm guessing you read it in English (considering your link)? I read it translated in Swedish, so maybe our experiences weren't totally the same because of that too.   Indeed. I read it a couple of years ago, great stuff.   Nothing going on that's been established, but check out his page on IMDb:    http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0027572/      If there's any news, they will probably be to the right, the "Related News" column.   16 movies I haven't seen from that list. Otherwise, it's quite a mainstream list with a big focus on films from the Anglosphere and Hollywood. I wouldn't even consider having a big chunk of those movies near my own top 300, but each to their own.    Is there a site out there that rates image quality of blu ray releases?  http://www.blu-ray.com/ does that. http://www.dvdbeaver.com/ can help you with their Blu-ray reviews as well.   Yeah, I like all those three more as well. Double Indemnity (1955) is my favourite by him. One of the best film noir flicks! The Lost Weekend (1945), Stalag 17 (1953) and Ace in the Hole (1951) are some other Wilder films I think are better than Some Like It Hot (1959) too.    I did, however, notice that sometimes the definition can be distracting when watching older movies (70's-80's).     Can you elaborate what you mean? It always depends on the transfer, some can be worse than others. But for me, I have never had an exception where I wanted to watch the DVD of a film instead of the Blu-ray (if I have access to both of them and in terms of quality), not yet at least.   Or maybe she just has a different taste than you? A movie isn't automatically and objectively good just because it has a high IMDb rating. Taste is subjective. Of course, it's a bit of a far stretch to call everyone who rates movies on IMDb and RT idiots, because that would include people that dislike certain movies as much as she does, so that should probably be taken with a pinch of salt.        but she actively dislikes really good ones.      That sounds strange, I think it's just that she probably dislikes some of the movies you think are good, which isn't the same thing. Everyone doesn't like every movie you like, that's just the way the world is. Deal with it.   Good for you!   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_cinema   Great director! Which of his movies have you seen so far? Criterion Collection's release of the Apu trilogy is probably going to be neat!   You can't go wrong with some Ozu and Fassbinder!   I guess you simply mean films that are not in the English language? If so, here's my 25 favourites:      1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989) *(Michael Haneke)*     2. Andrey Rublyov (1966) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*    3. L'eclisse (1962) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*    4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) *(Chantal Akerman)*     5. Tanin no kao (1966) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*     6. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969) *(Yoshishige Yoshida)*     7. Suna no onna (1964) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*     8. Hiroshima mon amour (1959) *(Alain Resnais)*     9. Nattvardsgsterna (1963) *(Ingmar Bergman)*     10. Stntang (1994) *(Bla Tarr)*     11. Krhozat (1988) *(Bla Tarr)*     12. Le trou (1960) *(Jacques Becker)*     13. Sanma no aji (1962) *(Yasujir Ozu)*     14. Smultronstllet (1957) *(Ingmar Bergman)*     15. Pickpocket (1959) *(Robert Bresson)*      16. Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) *(Rainer Werner Fassbinder)*    17. Tystnaden (1963) *(Ingmar Bergman)*     18. La notte (1961) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*    19. Zerkalo (1975) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*    20. Un condamn  mort s'est chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut (1956) *(Robert Bresson)*     21. Stalker (1979) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*     22. Solyaris (1972) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*     23. Spalovac mrtvol (1969) *(Juraj Herz)*     24. Jalsaghar (1958) *(Satyajit Ray)*    25. Banshun (1949) *(Yasujir Ozu)*       The classic monster list! I should maybe take care of that one soon, I still got 21 entries in it left to see.   A great list overall. The only movie on the list which I didn't like that much was Some Like It Hot (1959) that I rated 2/5, all the other ones are 3/5, 4/5 and some 5/5 in my book. Maybe I should rewatch the Wilder film, I would maybe like it more now, I like some of his other movies nonetheless.   A pity! No, I haven't seen them, but I want to do it!   Well, I want to see Eisenstein in Guanajuato (2015), I was just sticking to the five I look forward to the most. Jia Zhangke's new film could be interesting to see too, but I had to admit that I wasn't really a big fan of the three films I've seen by him so far. On the other hand, I'll still watch some of his other movies anyways, maybe I'll find someone I like a bit more than the others.   I had a nice movie weekend myself. Watched fifteen movies, which will do for now. It's Monday and 4:19 in the morning here, so I'm going to bed now. Oh, and the best ones were Ghare-Baire (1984) by Satyajit Ray, Tsuma wa kokuhaku suru (1961) by Yasuz Masumura and Indagine su un cittadino al di sopra di ogni sospetto (1970) by Elio Petri. Great stuff. Now I got [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OyP2fQRSzI) song stuck in my head, all because of the Petri movie and Morricone.   Does it? Do you know something I don't? The last thing I heard was that he was going to make a whole new movie after he cancelled the film that was going to be called Flashmob, but I haven't heard any more details, just that it will be shot in France.   For the first time?   I think it was L'eclisse (1962) by Michelangelo Antonioni.   There's a chance for that, sure.   Or even better, a 49 minute scene where he meets Woody Allen and they go for lunch to discuss Ingmar Bergman's movies.   Nattvardsgsterna (1963) and Smultronstllet (1957) by Ingmar Bergman.   I'm mostly excited about these:      * Ji-geum-eun-mat-go-geu-ddae-neun-teul-li-da (2015) *(Hong Sang-soo)*     * Le Louvre sous l'Occupation (2015) *(Aleksandr Sokurov)*    * Rak ti Khon Kaen (2015) *(Apichatpong Weerasethakul)*     * Taxi (2015) *(Jafar Panahi)*    * Umimachi Diary (2015) *(Hirokazu Koreeda)*     I'm hoping that Abbas Kiarostami, Lav Diaz and Michael Haneke are giving us with new movies as well. I know at least that Haneke and Kiarostami are both working on something new, but those will probably not be released this year. We'll see.   * A Clockwork Orange (1971)    * Hud (1963) * Taxi Driver (1976)    * The Hustler (1961)       Le trou (1960), the suspense nearly killed me the first time I watched it! A true masterpiece and the best prison film ever made!   Oh, there's probably hundreds of movies I own that I haven't watched yet. I try to buy movies as often I can, so I usually always own something I haven't watched. I watch movies via streaming and movies that aren't my own as well for example, so that's also another reason that there's always unwatched films in my own personal collection. I always have movies to watch, whether it's in my own collection, via streaming or any other way, so there's a lot left to see for me. Too little time, too many films! I just don't have the time and possibility to watch exactly everything at once. I recently bought San taam (2007) and Tky sonata (2008) for instance (both were Eureka releases (Masters of Cinema) and on dual format), which I haven't watched at all, but I just got both a couple of days ago. So it's all a matter of time and what to prioritize.   Exactly, same here. But does your partner hate them even if the movie is in a language your partner isn't fluent in?   Woody Allen.   Robert Bresson is a great example. He started with a slapstick comedy, then doing a bit more regular/classic dramas, and after that, he evolved his style with his own set of "rules" of uncompromising minimalism where he totally abandoned classic filmmaking and did movies the way no one ever did before, just to come as far away from the theatre as possible, which he felt didn't belong in film.   You really do that? I have never heard about anyone who does this, seems like a strange way to watch a film if it's in a language you don't know for example, especially if it's a film with much dialogue. Does it work well for you?   I always use them if they're available, even when a movie is in a language I already know. It's easy to miss something, dialogue volume can be low sometimes etc. And when it comes to watching movies in languages you don't know, it's quite mandatory and essential to have subtitles if you don't want to make it harder for yourself. And there's no one that knows every single language in the world either.   If you ask me, it's a movie that actually has something to say, about film, consumtion and our society as well. People are of course free to call it off as "pointless garbage", but I think there's a lot of people that don't understand it at all, which is a bit sad. I'm not judging everybody who didn't like it, only stating that I've seen viewers who completely misunderstood it or didn't get it and labeled it as bad because of that. Also, you have to have seen a fair share of cinema to get all the intertextuality, there's a certain reference to one of Tarkovsky's movies in the ending, just to take an example of something that actually is connected to the movie.   I have no idea what you have seen, so I'll chip in with all my favourite films:       * Der siebente Kontinent (1989) *(Michael Haneke)*      * Andrey Rublyov (1966) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*     * L'eclisse (1962) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*     * Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) *(Chantal Akerman)*      * Tanin no kao (1966) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*      * Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969) *(Yoshishige Yoshida)*     * Suna no onna (1964) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*     * Hiroshima mon amour (1959) *(Alain Resnais)*    * Nattvardsgsterna (1963) *(Ingmar Bergman)*     * Stntang (1994) *(Bla Tarr)*     * Krhozat (1988) *(Bla Tarr)*     * Le trou (1960) *(Jacques Becker)*    * C'era una volta il West (1968) *(Sergio Leone)*      * Sanma no aji (1962) *(Yasujir Ozu)*    * Smultronstllet (1957) *(Ingmar Bergman)*     * Pickpocket (1959) *(Robert Bresson)*     * Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) *(Rainer Werner Fassbinder)*     * Tystnaden (1963) *(Ingmar Bergman)*    * La notte (1961) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*       * Zerkalo (1975) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*     * Un condamn  mort s'est chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut (1956) *(Robert Bresson)*    * Stalker (1979) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*    * Solyaris (1972) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*    * Spalovac mrtvol (1969) *(Juraj Herz)*    * Jalsaghar (1958) *(Satyajit Ray)*    * Banshun (1949) *(Yasujir Ozu)*     It would be nice to know if you haven't seen any of them already. If there's some you've missed, it would be really interesting to hear those you will be watching and the verdict later on!   I would say that it's certainly not your second choice. Basically, it's a message about violence in the media, Haneke himself wrote an essay about his thoughts concerning this, it can be found in the book A Companion to Michael Haneke. I would suggest to look it up if you are interested in his views and if you want to clear some light about the movie as well.   I would recommend that you look up some of the stuff Criterion Collection and Eureka (Masters of Cinema) have released, they both usually have great transfers and often release important and great films together with interesting bonus features.  Here's three movies I would really advice to pick up which are great and look stunning on Blu-ray:      * L'eclisse (1962) (Criterion Collection)     * Pickpocket (1959) (Criterion Collection)     * Seppuku (1962) (Masters of Cinema)      http://www.blu-ray.com/ is also a good source if you want to know a bit more about certain releases, they have many reviews where they for example go a little more in-depth about the video quality etc.   I really disliked Chappie (2015) (which I talked about why in several other threads) and thought that Ex Machina (2015) was mediocre, but I think you shouldn't rely on what movies you should watch based on the majority of Reddit. This isn't a site where you will find the universal truth about which movies are good and bad, because there's no such thing. And you really shouldn't expect Reddit to know exactly what you would like, that's just foolish. Nothing here has anything to do with right or wrong as well, rather different opinions. I didn't recommend Ex Machina (2015), so I guess the rest of Reddit can take care of your "fuck you".   http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/directors/    I would say that list is the one to go with if you want something already established, it's a great starting point. It's a list with a lot of great movies that are good to have seen and to know about if you're just getting interested in cinema, as well as essential and important ones. It also gets you introduced to films from several different countries and decades.   Hiroshima mon amour (1959), directed by Alain Resnais and with a script by Marguerite Duras, has one of the best voice-overs in my opinion. What I like about it is that Resnais didn't just use voice-over narration for the sake of the pictures, but to asks questions, make points and describe memories for example. Of course, anyone can do that, but I don't think any movie can tackle it the same way as Hiroshima mon amour (1959) did.        There's also not only one voice-over, but two, because there's two central characters to be concerned about. I just love how the editing and the images work together with the two voice-overs and form the narrative together with its central themes of time, space, memories and subjectivity to add more complexity to the exploration of the problems with our existance, especially communication and the impossibility to fully know a human being. Also, while doing this, we travel back and forth to both the present and the past. Even the beginning of the movie starts with the two characters talking through a voice-over narration where one of them claims one thing and the other one the total opposite, because it's a film that has to do with opposites and contradictions.      I can go on talking, but I won't spoil too much of everything for those who haven't seen it, this movie is mandatory to see if you're interested in cinema. It's a very poetic, complex and beautiful masterpiece that has a very special use of voice-over narration.       On another one, I think Robert Bresson's use of voice-over should be mentioned too, especially in his later movies. We had a thread about him some weeks ago, so I won't go in-depth about him once again, but as he was a perfectionist and a minimalist, his use of voice-over was as well very special and precise, everything was well calculated and he was quite determined when it came to strip down everything to its bare essentials. His book explains a bit about his own "rules" and what he thought about the relation between sounds and images, very interesting if you haven't read it.   Stalker (1979) and Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969).   Have you searched?       Whole Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/search?q=Seeking+a+Friend+for+the+End+of+the+World     This subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/search?q=Seeking+a+Friend+for+the+End+of+the+World restrict_sr=on         I would say that 202 user reviews on IMDb it's a lot if we are talking about movies that should deserve more attention. I think it's a bit unfair to the ones that really deserve it. Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (2012) is a typical movie that I didn't even have to actively seek out to find about, I saw it advertised on YouTube, IMDb and similar big sites without putting any effort to it. I think if one is going to pick a movie that truly deserves more attention, it should actually be one that most people haven't heard of, that's faded in obscurity, quite forgotten, rarely mentioned and not talked about a lot, a movie where you actually have to be a bit active to find out. Of course, you can find stuff by sheer luck, but I hope you get my point.       But maybe it has to do with how much you are into movies. A big majority here in this subreddit label movies like Moon (2009) and Sunshine (2007) as not so well known, which I think says quite much.      Really? There's been several threads about this movie here, and people have been talking about it in other threads as well. There's over 150 critics that reviewed it on Rotten Tomatoes and 129 pages with reviews by the audience on the same site. There's also over 202 user reviews for it on IMDb and I see people mentioning it on a lot of other various sites. That's just some examples, it feels like it has gotten its share of attention, because there's a lot other movies that don't even get a third of that much awareness. That's why I think it's a bit strange to mention a movie like that. Maybe you just missed all the talk.       Anyways, if I have to pick one movie, I would say Tobenai chinmoku (1966) by Kazuo Kuroki. It seems that I'm the only one that has mentioned it here on Reddit, I couldn't find anything if I searched for it, not even by the English title. A quite forgotten gem, only 159 users have rated in on IMDb for example. I would easily consider it one of the best Japanese movies ever made, it really deserves to be talked about more. There's not even a proper DVD/Blu-ray release of it yet, which I hope will change in the future.    All of them are great and some I would consider the best films ever made. Criterion Collection has released all of them on DVD and three of them on Blu-ray. Some other studios have released them on DVD and Blu-ray as well, you can find more information on http://www.blu-ray.com/ regarding the Blu-ray versions. Three of them are also available to stream on Hulu.   It can be a glitch, or maybe it's not just updated yet. It's a very new movie, so there's probably many more reviews coming in a couple of days.   Five of my favourites when it comes to such films:      * Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) *(Rainer Werner Fassbinder)*     Takes place entirely in the house of the main character.      * L'anne dernire  Marienbad (1961) *(Alain Resnais)*    Takes place in a chateau.      * Le trou (1960) *(Jacques Becker)*    Takes pretty much place a prison only.      * Suna no onna (1964) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*    Takes place by the seaside in the desert, almost entirely in a sandhole.     * Un condamn  mort s'est chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut (1956) *(Robert Bresson)*    Takes place in a prison.       Yeah, but that's only 5 reviews.   Here's fifteen recommendations you just have to watch:      * A Woman Under the Influence (1974) *(John Cassavetes)*    * Akai satsui (1964) *(Shhei Imamura)*           * Angst vor der Angst (1975) *(Rainer Werner Fassbinder)*           * Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) *(Rainer Werner Fassbinder)*     * Il deserto rosso (1964) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*  * Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) *(Chantal Akerman)*        * Jen (1967) *(Yoshishige Yoshida)*     * Mouchette (1967) *(Robert Bresson)*    * Mulholland Dr. (2001) *(David Lynch)*        * Opening Night (1977) *(John Cassavetes)*        * Persona (1966) *(Ingmar Bergman)*          * Possession (1981) *(Andrzej Zulawski)*       * Repulsion (1965) *(Roman Polanski)*    * Tsuma wa kokuhaku suru (1961) *(Yasuz Masumura)*            * Tystnaden (1963) *(Ingmar Bergman)*     These are what I would consider some of the best tragic and dark female character studies ever made.   If you start chronologically, you begin with Sono otoko, kyb ni tsuki (1989), which will work quite well as a starting point, it's a movie more oriented in action and police stuff. Or if you want to start with something more of a drama/comedy, go with Kikujir no natsu (1999), it's one of his most loved movies and it's quite easy to like as well as accessible.   Best:      * Andrey Rublyov (1966) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*        * Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) *(Chantal Akerman)*         * L'eclisse (1962) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*     * Suna no onna (1964) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*          * Tanin no kao (1966) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*          Worst:       * A Room with a View (1985) *(James Ivory)*     * Armageddon (1998) *(Michael Bay)*    * Lat sau san taam (1992) *(John Woo)*      * The Chronicle History of King Henry the Fift with His Battell Fought at Agincourt in France (1944) *(Laurence Olivier)*     * The Rock (1996) *(Michael Bay)*      Nobi (1959) by Kon Ichikawa.   Huh?   * Den-en ni shisu (1974) *(Shji Terayama)*      * Les quatre cents coups (1959) *(Franois Truffaut)*       They don't have connected plots, so it doesn't matter. But make sure to watch all of them, it's some good stuff.   Here's two recommendations:         * Ich mchte kein Mann sein (1918) *(Ernst Lubitsch)*      It's about Ossi, she's revolting against her parents because they want her to be like a proper young lady, instead she goes to buy men's clothes and starts acting like a man. A little gem that's quite entertaining and charming.       * Berg-Ejvind och hans hustru (1918) *(Victor Sjstrm)*     In my opinon, Sjstrm was easily the best of the Swedish directors from the silent era. This one is about Berg-Ejvind that is running away from justice. He comes to work at widow Halla's farm and they fall in love. But when the truth about him is revealed, he and Halla decide to flee to the mountains. Sjstrm really proves that he was great at capturing nature in this movie. Not my favourite by him, but really worth watching.   Great film, one the best ones from the last fifteen years. I should rewatch it soon.   Suna no onna (1964) by Hiroshi Teshigahara.   Welt am Draht (1973) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder could count. Solyaris (1972) by Andrei Tarkovsky is another one mixing science fiction and mystery. None of them have that much to do with detectives, even though Welt am Draht (1973) has a detective in it, but I'm guessing you were after either detective stories or mysteries?   Well, maybe the "fault" is rather within yourself than me. You can always use Google to look up the movies you don't recognize. I even wrote the names of the directors. If I don't recognize something myself, I just look it up instead of trying to make a fuzz about it, attacking someone or anything similar. There is nothing that hinders you from anything at all. We are on the Internet, information is easy to find.        If you want to post on a Japanese site to talk about a Japanese film, would you use the French or English title?       As I already said, I always use the original titles.      Oh, there's so much great Japanese cinema. I've picked out 40 of my absolute favourites when it comes to Japanese films for you:       * Tanin no kao (1966) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*       * Suna no onna (1964) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*     * Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969) *(Yoshishige Yoshida)*     * Sanma no aji (1962) *(Yasujir Ozu)*     * Banshun (1949) *(Yasujir Ozu)*      * Mujo (1970) *(Akio Jissoji)*      * Tobenai chinmoku (1966) *(Kazuo Kuroki)*       * Gion bayashi (1953) *(Kenju Mizoguchi)*      * Shinj: Ten no Amijima (1969) *(Masahiro Shinoda)*     * Seppuku (1962) *(Masaki Kobayashi)*    * Shichinin no samurai (1954) *(Akira Kurosawa)*     * Okasareta hakui (1967) *(Kji Wakamatsu)*     * Akai satsui (1964) *(Shhei Imamura)*    * Shura (1971) *(Toshio Matsumoto)*     * Onibaba (1964) *(Kaneto Shind)*     * Sansh day (1954) *(Kenji Mizoguchi)*     * Narayama bushik (1958) *(Keisuke Kinoshita)*    * Koroshi no rakuin (1967) *(Seijun Suzuki)*   * Dai-bosatsu tge (1966) *(Kihachi Okamoto)*     * Bara no sretsu (1969) *(Toshio Matsumoto)*     * Kawaita hana (1964) *(Masahiro Shinoda)*      * Nobi (1959) *(Kon Ichikawa)*     * Rengoku eroica (1970) *(Yoshishige Yoshida)*      * Sanbiki no samurai (1964) *(Hideo Gosha)*     * Genroku Chshingura (1941) *(Kenji Mizoguchi)*     * Onna no naka ni iru tanin (1966) *(Mikio Naruse)*     * Tengoku to jigoku (1963) *(Akira Kurosawa)*     * Kshikei (1968) *(Nagisa shima)*     * Saraba natsu no hikari (1968) *(Yoshishige Yoshida)*     * Hadaka no shima (1960) *(Kaneto Shind)*     * Sho o suteyo machi e deyou (1971) *(Shji Terayama)*    * Uta (1972) *(Akio Jissoji)*     * Shinjuku maddo (1970) *(Kji Wakamatsu)*     * Buta to gunkan (1961) *(Shhei Imamura)*     * Nippon no akuryo (1970) *(Kazuo Kuroki)*     * Shinjuku dorob nikki (1969) *(Nagisa shima)*    * Tsuit no zawameki (1988) *(Yoshihiko Matsui)*      * Yaj no seishun (1963) *(Seijun Suzuki)*     * Rashmon (1950) *(Akira Kurosawa)*     * Den-en ni shisu (1974) *(Shji Terayama)*      I hope you'll find something you like. With this list, you'll also get introduced to some of the great and important directors from Japan as well.    It's pretentious as fuck.      No, it's not. It's rather pretentious to put so much focus on it as you seem to do.     I have explained this a lot of times before, but I guess I have to do it again. I always use the original titles when writing, because that's my standard and those are the original titles that the directors wanted to have in the first place. Every single movie doesn't have alternate or English titles either, and I don't want to be mixing everything around for the sake of that.           For example, Le Havre (2011) and Play (2011) don't have English language titles, but titles in some other languages. I am also of the opinion that many English language titles are quite bad.      And for you, it seems that you are more interesting in making a fuzz about things than actually discussing and/or talking about the movies themselves. I'm not breaking against any rules and can't see the problem. If you are interested in the English language titles, you are free to look them up for yourself.    Not at all. I love movies and am very impressed.      So you believe me now? Hah.           Like, how many movies came out in 1893?        http://www.imdb.com/year/1893/      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1893_in_film     Both IMDb and Wikipedia only have two movies each listed from that year. But this was at a very early stage of the history of film, which probably says quite much about it.       You must have a wealth of historical knowledge if you've seen that diversity of movies.      Well, I guess so! I think it's great to have so many references to work with if you go through the history of film by each year in a similar way. It also helps you a lot when watching movies overall. I try to pick up as much as I can about cinema. If one has some kind of interest in films, I think it's important to try and watch different kind of films as much as you can, from every decade and from all countries you can find movies from. Even if you don't like everything, it makes your own experiences and references only richer. As I said before, I didn't entirely know if I actually had missed a year before I looked at it a little closer.        May l ask what decade of your life you're in?       I was born in 1988, if that's what you are wondering about. I'll be turning 27 this year.        They even missed one of the best ones, Je t'aime, je t'aime (1968) by Alain Resnais.    1966 - I have practically no interest in westerns and 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' seems to be the only notable film that came out that year.        You should see it though. I know many people who weren't at all into the Western genre, but absolutely loved that movie. It's quite universal and easy to like. A real classic. Leone's Western movies were quite different from American Western movies, like those by Howard Hawks, John Ford etc.         And the only notable film? Oh, I would disagree on that. Two of my all-time favourites came out that year, Andrey Rublyov (1966) by Andrei Tarkovsky and Tanin no kao (1966) by Hiroshi Teshigahara. Both are masterpieces. The first one being Tarkovsky's massive epic about the great fifteenth-century Russian iconographer, but also a movie about a dark time in the history of Russia. The other one is an amazing and complex exploration about identity that is partly science fiction.              Here'e eight other notable films from the year that are very good:        * Au hasard Balthazar (1966) *(Robert Bresson)*        * Blowup (1966) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*     * Dai-bosatsu tge (1966) *(Kihachi Okamoto)*     * La battaglia di Algeri (1966) *(Gillo Pontecorvo)*     * Onna no naka ni iru tanin (1966) *(Mikio Naruse)*       * Persona (1966) *(Ingmar Bergman)*     * Taiji ga mitsury suru toki (1966) *(Kji Wakamatsu)*        * Tobenai chinmoku (1966) *(Kazuo Kuroki)*      A film like Persona (1966) is of course totally essential if you have the least interest in cinema. And for example, I feel like a movie such as Tobenai chinmoku (1966) is extremely forgotten and/or overlooked. It deserves more attention, I would rank it as one of the best Japanese movies of all time.   Here's my ten favourites from the 1980s:         1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989) *(Michael Haneke)*     2. Krhozat (1988) *(Bla Tarr)*      3. A Zed   Two Noughts (1985) *(Peter Greenaway)*         4. Paris, Texas (1984) *(Wim Wenders)*        5. Shoah (1985) *(Claude Lanzmann)*     6. Blue Velvet (1986) *(David Lynch)*      7. Tsuit no zawameki (1988) *(Yoshihiko Matsui)*       8. Down by Law (1986) *(Jim Jarmusch)*        9. Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986) *(Konstantin Lopushanskiy)*      10. Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987) *(Wim Wenders)*        Now I guess the question is, what should I watch from 1917?      Umirayushchii lebed (1917) by Yevgeni Bauer! The English title is The Dying Swan. I think he's a director from the silent days that really needs more recognition. If I remember correctly, the movie is also available on YouTube. A very beautiful little melodrama with a great dance sequence and a captivating story. Bauer also had some interesting techniques when it came to tinting and double exposures. Do not miss this! Probably my favourite film of the ones before the 1920s.      Also, two honorable mentions are Tsen frn Stormyrtorpet (1917) and Terje Vigen (1917), both directed by Victor Sjstrm.    The topic clearly doesn't concern you.      I didn't know that from the start. That's why I went through all the films I had seen, because I wanted to see if there was a year that I missed. I'm sorry if I made you upset or anything. It felt bad to not answer after all the hard work of looking up all the statistics of the films I have watched.           I was actually expecting a lot more users that had watched something from every year, I'm quite surprised over how many here actually have some years missed. I'm not saying that in a bad way, because there's a lot of great suggestions in the thread, and hopefully someone will discover something nice.   First of all, no. I watch films from all over the world. Of all the films I have seen, English language films are even the ones dominating the list.      I never acted like anything is superior to anything. I just made a list without the movies OP mentioned. That the ones I liked the most happen to be in Hungarian, Korean, Swedish or French, that's totally irrelevant. It's not the same thing as ignoring something. It's you yourself that's putting all the focus on the language, not me. I care about the film, not the language. Also, English is not my main language, so what's foreign to you might not be that foreign for me. Sorry if I ruined your conception of the world or anything, but when you talk like the way you do, it seems that you are acting as if English language films would be superior, so I don't really know what you want to get out of this discussion. Maybe you want me to change my taste all for you? I that case, I'm not doing it, I'm just being honest. Too bad people mistake honesty for something else.   Well, too bad for you. I don't get why it would be hard to believe. I don't really know what you wanted to say with your comment either. Do you want me to prove it to you somehow? Or are you just trying to make fun? Do you want me to excuse myself because I like watching movies? If you knew me, then you probably wouldn't write anything like that. But I guess it's easy having your own ideas about people you don't know on the Internet.   Stntang (1994).    Most cynical: Funny Games      Haneke actually said something interesting regarding movies and cynicism that I agree with:       *"Films that are entertainments give simple answers but I think that's ultimately more cynical, as it denies the viewer room to think. If there are more answers at the end, then surely it is a richer experience."*   Sorry if I dissapoint you, but after looking at the list of the films I have watched, I seem to have seen films from every single year in the history of cinema. There doesn't seem to be any available films made earlier than 1887 according to IMDb and Wikipedia, so that's what I came down to. Now I can't answer your question of what I want to see the most either, hah.   My choice would be Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013) by Lav Diaz.    1) Do you agree with these 10 movies being selected as the best of the decade so far?          I agree about The Act of Killing (2012). The rest? Not at all. I should add that I haven't seen Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) yet, but if I know myself good enough, I don't think it will make it on my list either.   2) If you could do a top 10 list not counting these movies, what would it be?        I think it would look like this together with my ratings if I remove The Act of Killing (2012):      1. Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013) *(Lav Diaz)* 4/5         2. A torini l (2011) *(Bla Tarr)* 4/5            3. Book chon bang hyang (2011) *(Hong Sang-soo)* 4/5           4. Amour (2012) *(Michael Haneke)* 4/5           5. Da-reun na-ra-e-suh (2012) *(Hong Sang-soo)* 4/5            6. Le Havre (2011) *(Aki Kaurismki)* 4/5              7. Dupa dealuri (2012) *(Cristian Mungiu)* 4/5           8. Jodaeiye Nader az Simin (2011) *(Asghar Farhadi)* 4/5           9. Loong Boonmee raleuk chat (2010) *(Apichatpong Weerasethakul)* 3/5            10. Play (2011) *(Ruben stlund)* 3/5           Some suggestions:      * Clo de 5  7 (1962) (Paris, France)       * Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987) (Berlin, Germany or West Germany if you will)       * Do the Right Thing (1989) (Brooklyn, New York, USA)        * L'immortelle (1963) (Istanbul, Turkey)               * Manhattan (1979) (Manhattan, New York, USA)              * Mystery Train (1989) (Memphis, USA)                * Onna ga kaidan wo agaru toki (1960) (Tokyo, Japan)      * Shinjuku dorob nikki (1969) (Tokyo, Japan)    * Stroszek (1977) (Wisconsin, USA)              * Tsuit no zawameki (1988) (Osaka, Japan)               Suna no onna (1964) by Hiroshi Teshigahara. I think the movie captured the core of the novel by Kb Abe perfectly, especially the absurdity and meaninglessness of our existance and the overall feel the book had and all the situations. Abe also collaborated with Teshigahara. The music by Takemitsu was amazing as well.   There's only 11 films from India in the collection if you look it up on the website, so it isn't that many. And three of them belong to the Eclipse Series 40: Late Ray. A direct link when using the search function:     http://www.criterion.com/library/expanded_view?c=India p=1        Anyways, I would recommend Jalsaghar (1958) by Satyajit Ray, that's my favourite film by him. A masterpiece. Beautiful and tender cinematography, interesting portrayal of the main character and wonderful music. Charulata (1964) and Mahanagar (1963) by Ray are great as well. I can add that the Eclipse box set that includes the Ray films is worth looking into too. All three of the films in that box are good, especially Ghare-Baire (1984).       I haven't seen the films by Ismail Merchant, Zafar Hai and James Ivory that are out of print, but these aren't maybe one hundred percent Indian because of the collaboration with UK and USA. Then there's Monsoon Wedding (2001) by Mira Nair, but I haven't seen that one either. I actually missed it when it aired on TV some weeks ago.   It looks like Samuel isn't going to take it anymore.   Well, there's subtitles (at least in English) available for all of them, sure.   Not a single one? Wow, then I'll say you have some great flicks to discover!

Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987) *(Wim Wenders)*        Here's my top ten:          1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989) *(Michael Haneke)*       2. Andrey Rublyov (1966) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*          3. L'eclisse (1962) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*        4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) *(Chantal Akerman)*      5. Tanin no kao (1966) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*        6.

Nattvarsgsterna (1964) *(Ingmar Bergman)*      10. Stntang (1994) *(Bla Tarr)*       Andrzej Zulawski probably. And hopefully. It was fifteen years ago his last movie came out, now he's back to filmmaking again. His new movie Cosmos (2015) seems to be completed too, so I'm looking forward to that. I really like Possession (1981) that he directed, great one.   Not really surprising, it seems quite bad.   I think it was when I just stumbled upon L'eclisse (1962) by Michelangelo Antonioni on a film site. By that time, I had not seen so many older movies. And I decided to give it a go. I just loved it. It had a whole different film language than I was used to. Afterwards, I looked up the other two Antonioni films in his alienation trilogy and saw those two as well. I also started to read more about film in general, about different directors, film history, cinematography etc. I guess it was that particular film that hooked me. I remember that Robert Bresson also was a big part of it. I started to read film essays, looking up important and essential films and so on. Slowly, all of this changed the way I looked at cinema overall and I started absorbing all the information I could get my hands on.   M (1931) is a German movie. And if you want to be fair, The Third Man (1949) is a British flick. But M (1931) is the only movie in the list that isn't an English language movie.   **1880:**           1. Roundhay Garden Scene (1888)     2. Traffic Crossing Leeds Bridge (1888)    3. Accordion Player (1888)        **1890:**     1. L'arroseur arros (1895)      2.

A torini l (2011)         I haven't actually seen that one yet, I only know of it. I have to go through the Truffaut films I have left soon. It was quite long ago I actually saw one of his movies.   * Cra cuervos (1976) (Carlos Saura)     * Den-en ni shisu (1974) (Shji Terayama)      * Dong dong de jia qi (1984) (Hou Hsiao-hsien)     * Ivanovo detstvo (1962) (Andrei Tarkovsky)      * Khane-ye doust kodjast? (1987) (Abbas Kiarostami)     * Les quatre cents coups (1959) (Franois Truffaut)      * Pather Panchali (1955) (Satyajit Ray)     * The Go-Between (1970) (Joseph Losey)      I picked out eight of my favourites around the whole concept of childhood. I also tried to get it quite diverse. Saura deals with a child fascinated by death as well as a story that uses Franco's dictatorship to give it even more depth. Terayama's film is quite psychedelic and about a very unhappy childhood. Hsiao-hsien's Taiwanese picture explores relations in the family, meanings and responsibilities when it comes to grownups through the eyes of children. Tarkovsky's war film focuses on how a child can experience war and the dreams that come up in that situation. Kiarostami's movie is about expectations that come from the adult world and a little bit of the friendship of children. When it comes to Truffaut, you already mentioned it yourself. I just put it in my list because it's still one of my favourites and one of the most important ones, a great flick about what can happen to a boy who is left without attention from his own parents. Then you have Ray's beautiful and poetic movie about poverty and how it is to grow up with dreams in rural India. And finally, Losey's period drama that deals with a young boy stuck between two different adults and how it affects him.   * 8 (1963)       * Le mpris (1963)      * Nun va Goldoon (1996)         Many ideas can be good. And this particular one can be interesting. But it all comes down to how you execute the idea and what you want to say with it, that's the important part. I think that's the aspect one should put first. I haven't seen the movie, so I can't say anything about that, just that the execution is the most important thing, not only the bare essentials of the idea. If you are wondering whether or not it's a good idea to put in motion in real life, I would say no. It would probably cause more damage than anything good.   Der siebente Kontinent (1989) by Michael Haneke. But one should also know that the list is for example a bit corrupted concerning the votes. Some people use only 1 and 10, people form groups to vote up/against certain movies, many vote up newer movies like crazy, certain users rate movies they haven't even seen, every Tom, Dick and Harry can make an account and start voting etc. And it's based pretty much on popularity too. So it should always be taken with a big pinch of salt, I just like to point that out.   Indeed. I didn't plan on getting the Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman box set some months ago, but I just couldn't hold myself because of the price it had during the last sale.   The best ones in your list:          Tokyo Story, La Jetee/Sans Soleil, A Woman Under the Influence, Taste of Cherry, Ballad of Narayama, Ali: Fear Eats the Soul, My Winnipeg          Good/worth picking up:            Black Narcissus, Gomorrah, Good Morning, The Great Dictator, La Haine, Harlan County, USA, The Killing, Lonesome, Love Streams, The Red Shoes, Rosetta, Safety Last!, The Gold Rush, 12 Angry Men, Make Way for Tomorrow, The Thin Red Line, Yi Yi      Not my taste, but still worth seeing:       La Cienega      When it comes to The Complete Jacques Tati, this is probably one of the better chances when it comes to box sets, you'll get it fairly cheap. I'm not a die hard fan of Tati, but if you like him, it's a good opportunity to invest in the box. I haven't seen the ones I left out, so I can't say much about them.       Repulsion (1965) by Roman Polanski.   I think those people that talk about those things mostly aren't that interested in cinema overall and/or look at movies with a single-sided approach. Of course, actors and such is one thing, but caring that much about awards and box office is quite irrelevant. For me, I never care about how much money a film made, that makes no difference for me, that's probably the last thing I care about. If you ask me, I can't even point out a single correct answer on how much money certain movies actually made, that's just not interesting for me. If a film by a director you like was a financial disaster, it probably can ruin the director to the point that the person can't do any more movies, but that's another thing knowing about than for example putting too much focus on the exact numbers.       Also, I have a hard time taking the Academy Awards too seriously, it's just some popular and superficial circlejerking that doesn't actually put the important things about cinema as an artform in the spotlight. The circlejerking Academy Awards people seem to care more about clothes and looks. On the other hand, I've never cared too much about awards in general. Anyways, I have to agree with you, too many seem to care about what you are mentioning, which is a bit sad.       I think you should look into films made by actual Arabs, that way you won't find the portrayal as typical Western as many Western movies tend to be. I'm not saying that all movies that aren't done by Arabs have that certain portrayal, just that you get another picture of the whole thing if it's films made by non-Western directors.        DIFF made an interesting list that could be good to look into:     https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/diffs+the+100+greatest+arab+films/      L'eclisse (1962) has one of my favourite endings. But I think you have to see the whole movie to get the context of it, which probably is the same with many other great endings.      Jason Friedberg, Aaron Seltzer, Brian Levant, and Dennis Dugan.   You probably mean Marmoulak (2004) by Kamal Tabrizi?   Wu wu mian (2015) by Tsai Ming-liang.   Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence (1974), she's simply amazing in that movie.   Why do you think that? It would rather be strange otherwise. I think it's just maybe you that didn't like some of the movies. I didn't like Chappie (2015) either, but you also have to remember that this list is made by several persons, which probably explains why it's so diverse.   You also have Je t'aime je t'aime (1968) by Alain Resnais. A good one.   Some good ones. Here's three of my favourites from Iran I would like to recommend:         * Nema-ye Nazdik (1990) (Abbas Kiarostami)        * Nun va Goldoon (1996) (Mohsen Makhmalbaf)       * Tabiate bijan (1974) (Sohrab Shahid Saless)     	121
             Yes we'll get a lot more pictures at even higher resolutions, but due to the limit of how much data can be sent each second this will take a few months (we'll get a few more on Friday).   I know that this is impossible, but just for a second imagine if all of those dollars that go in to the war would be put in advancing space explorations and technology how many more of these spectuacular days we'd had - I for one much rather would look at pictures of this kind than pictures of people getting blown in to pieces or gunned down.    There are craters on Pluto, but the area that was shown shows that there are still geological processes going on Pluto even after such a long time.   That would require a tremendous amounts of fuel and I don't know if we could do it in "real-time" to manouever it.    This device is about 500 times thinner than a human hair.                             	18

 Enemy.  In 1944, thats all we were told. The Nazis were enemies to the United States and had to be eliminated. Our generals never spoke about the families they had, the dreams the sought, or the way they bled just like us. No, they were enemies.   Now, I stare into the eyes of a man who took my last breath; a man who beat me until I screamed for mercy yet he would not deliver it. This same man, he now stood in front of me handing over a two Euro coin for a carton of milk.   His once rigid face and sharp eyes had aged into a sad, helpless stare. His hands shook, and his legs struggled to hold the weight of his aging body. The hands that once delivered a bullet into my head, were now outstretched handing me a coin.   After staring for a moment too long, I took the coin and handed him his milk. I knew him, but to him, I was just another supermarket clerk.   I watched him walk out the door, letting my grudges escape me.  A painless bullet took my life, but pain and suffering by the hands of age would take his.

ULA inherited their rockets from from Lockheed Martin and Boeing.  Rockets are most unreliable when the designs are new so by the time ULA was made most of the kinks had been worked out.     The Dragon Did not so much eject, as it was torn loose.     There cargo capsule is not equipped with a launch escape system.   Pluto is round so it would appear that the northern hemisphere is darker for some reason.   It sounds like the guy is not very cautious with his guns.   I don't think this is a roo.   I don't think it is a roo  I am surprised the mods have not caught it.  The joke is the guy was complaining about not seeing any Kangaroos in Austrailia when actually all he was doing was going to the Australian server of the game.  Not a roo, maybe enough people have linked now that they kind of need to leave it.   thats not a swicharoo   http://www.reddit.com/r/switcharoo/  This is where new ones are posted.  The only way to find out where the chain goes is to dive on in.  (or google for cheaters)    I started following a link a few weeks ago i stop and bookmark the page and pick it up again later.  I am only 4 months back so far.  A friend tells me that is speeds up the farther back you go though.

Yea that seems reasonable   Yea who knows the fix could have worked fine and something else unrelated caused the tanks to over pressurize.   I don't know that seems like something that is really predictable.  Also smashing into LOX tank would likely cause a breach leading to loss of pressure.   I think that this might be getting blown out of proportion.  A lot of times you can make something sound bad when it really isn't.  If NASA signed off on this fix, I am tempted to believe they thought it was a reasonable way to fix the problem.    Here is an example of another way you could write this.    * Insider says that cracks in the tank liner came up occasionally.  They would fix problem by applying a layer of teflon to the area in order to prevent cracks from spreading.  When you word it like that it sounds a lot less like shoddy workmanship and a lot more like legitimate repair practice.    Even if they were doing this we don't now that this was the cause.  Elon said that it was an over pressurization event.     I think up until you hear stage 1 FTS safe, it could still explode.  But it is not clear whether there is a seperate signal for both stage 1 and 2.   It would be interesting if this had happened 20 seconds later after MECO and stage 1 separation.  I wonder if stage 1 would still have been able to go in for a landing.   I would guess not significantly since this was a problem with the second stage.  But that is just my guess.  Edit: if there is a launch in August.  It is likely they may push back land landings for a couple more launches.   Wow dragon lived after explosion!!!   We are getting some good questions now   yea gwynn is not talking about the inter stage though.   It sounds like the news conference is basically saying relax everyone calm down there is no reason to believe this is going to cause dire problems.   It seems like the press conference is basically saying everybody calm down.  No reason to think this will have drastic consequences.    Can you link   [The one of Toph](http://i.imgur.com/v0aA5ZZ.jpg) is epic    Yea I like seeing ATLA content   lol I love that video   I check in.   you mean the big red explode button FTS   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcU4t6zRAKg   There are no Super Dracos on the Dragon 1   Is it supposed to do that?   I think you are right.     I thought that too but I don't think it actually was.  Some launches look slower than others.   Is there any reason it would not be able to open the parachutes?    Wow you can totally see it here thanks for this upload   it happens like that   sprakles?   Spacex FM :)   where was the barge?   Dude that skill is really marketable.  And it is a skill there is no way I could do that.   **The Martian, by Andy Weir**   That Would be interesting.  The funny thing is Korra is really almost a Fire bender or Earth bender at heart, not a water bender.   He also does it in some earlier episodes.   http://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/3b3ce0/no_spoilers_a_look_at_the_new_exclusive_art_print/csizegx   That would be cool, but i am talking about "The Rift" age Aang and team Aang teaming up with Book 4 Korra and team Korra.   I wish that Aang and Korra Could some how exist at the same time.  They would be a great team.  And team Aang and team Korra together could beat anyone.         I did't catch that.   oops   My first thought was i didn't know they made warthogs that early.  Then I realized it was a B-24.  Edit:B-25   More sand underwater means basically no island.  The islands will shrink to a size where the salt spray kills all the plants and then the rest erodes away.   I think that it might not be able to keep up with a sudden sea level rise though   maybe not politically but with sea level rise it is only going up from here.   by that logic they should have disappeared a long time ago.     Can you post this at /r/New_Horizons?   you should post this over at /r/New_Horizons    i have question.  Why don't we begin to pump sand to raise the outer banks?  we would only need to raise them by about 1-2 feet for the near future.  It is not unprecedented I have heard about them doing it to fix storm damage to beaches and even refill a whole [inlet](http://refugeassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/pea-island-inlet-tom-macken.jpg).   Any idea why JRTI got decommissioned?   it really shows you how stretched everything is at the poles with Africa just getting weird at the bottom.   Wow it looks like the [Game of Thrones intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN8PKcNGcuI)         Wait so is this a completely different barge?   Yes I understand what you are saying.  I think the reason people see hubris as a dangerous trait is that being overly confident can put you into dangerous situations. Someone who does not want to admit that they are in over their head is dangerous, but i would say someone who does not realize they are in over their head is even more dangerous.  It is also because even the best pilot in the world our still susceptible to the mechanical failures and limitations of the airplane.  I think people say that over confidence is a dangerous attitude because often times it comes with cockiness and the "nothing can hurt me" mentality.   I am not saying that it is unsafe to get it in low hours I was saying its not something you should boast about.  From his other comments it sounds like that was not his intention.   I just responded to the other comment.  I read the whole thing and it is not clear that is what you were trying to say.   Also you did not say, where di you get trained?   I did read the whole comment.  I can't tell what your tone is, but from my end the comment makes you sound boastful and full of yourself.  If i were you i would go back and make it more clear what you are getting at in your first comment.    You have to upload a video of this.    Plenty of pilots who are not celebs are naturally gifted at everything, I feel the need to brag that I passed my PPL in one hobs unit past minimum... one and only that one because of some stupid twat in circuit delaying me! Yes, I was the smug star pupil, and I loved it.  Just giving you a tip, bragging about how you got your PPL right at 40 hour is a pretty stupid thing to brag about.  Nobody will think that you are a better pilot for saying so, and the fact that you are bragging about it will only reflect badly on you and your judgment.    Getting your PPL close to 40 hours is more luck than anything, and training more than 2-3 times a week.  Many people just don't have the time and money to train at that pace.  The fact that you blame "some stupid twat in circuit" for you not getting in at exactly 40 hours further reflects badly upon you as a pilot.  Just wondering where did you get your training?   You said it.  That is the kind of attitude that gets you killed   I think the on problem is these go better und success kid and success penguin.  But good luck.      looks like MIB 3         soon they will start trying to organize volunteers to help clean up the beaches.   http://www.reddit.com/r/New_Horizons/comments/3as0ye/new_horizons_closes_in_returns_new_images_of/csgbsvx   Here you go   Yea now we are killing all the bees   I recall seeing something, it may be wikipedia, that gave the kilometers per pixel.

I just looked up his name, did not realize who he was.   I am looking for some sort of app that would allow you to edit street names and atributes on your smartphone.  It would be extremely helpful because you could add feature data, like if there is a sidewalk what the surface is like, and the street name, while you are actually there.  Is there anything like this?   Its funny Aang's head actually looks proportional.   What does IIRC stand for?   A gyrocopter that small does not need to be licensed and you don't need a pilots license to fly one.  Ultralight aircrafts have a lot less regulation than normal aircrafts.

I sense strong sarcasm with this one.   No she has survived other times she should have been burned.  The most recent when was when she flew off on Dragon.  Ser Barastian says that the dragon blew fire on her and as she was flying off he could see her hair on fire.  I think she even mentions that she lost her hair in the chapter of her in the wastelands with Dragon.   Please link so we can guess who it is.   I feel like this is where the FDA needs to step in.  There is no reason why a Pacemaker that is susceptible to this problem should be allowed to be put in someone.  If there is interference, than obviously your pacemaker needs to be redesigned.   Does this account for how much freight they are moving?  I am sure if you had semi trucks moving all that freight the pollution would be even worse.   This article seems to ignore basic facts, Like when you pollute a river, nobody lives near it, and the land is essentially worthless so nobody is going to bother spending money to defend it.    It also ignores common resources that are impossible to regulate with a pure market, like the air, or oceans.  I think anti government conservatives and libertarians who think the world would be a Utopia without government regulation, should go to Mexico.  I love Mexico, but they have serious problems with water quality and air quality.  In many cases this is due to there being much less regulation.  In many places raw sewage goes directly in to rivers and streams, along with industrial chemicals from factories.  If you are within 100 feet of the river you can smell it.  In the US we Used to do this exact same thing, in fact there are even some crazy stories about [Rivers catching on fire.](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Cuyahoga_River#Environmental_concerns)  But around the 70s and 80s we decided that it was time to start taking care of our country.  We created things like the EPA in order to regulate things that are damaging to the environment in order to make the US a better place to live.  Here is another example with the air.  Do you like to exercise outside going on bike rides and runs though your city?  I do too, and when i did it in a city in Mexico my lungs would usually start to develop a burning sensation by the time I was done exercising.   But what is a little burning?  Exercise hurts a little right?  Well after doing that for a couple months in a city in Mexico, I started to developed a cough that would not go away.  It was almost like a smokers cough.    Long story short.  I get back to the US where we have stricter regulations in order to protect air quality.  What do you know after a week or two with some good air those problems just magically went away.    Most conservatives seem to want it both ways they love that they can swim in rivers and lakes and breath fresh air, but then they want to get rid of the very organizations that have made those things possible.  PS: I just want to say I love Mexico! it is a great place and they are improving so much.  But it is still a good case study to see what a place is actually like when there is less government regulation to protect common resources.  Edit:  My first Gold :)  Thank you kind stranger.   ah ye of little faith.    There are tons of ways that she could get to Westeros.  In fact I think GRRM has been laying the groundwork to get her there.  GRRM Dropped a whole fleet of ships right at her doorstep with the iron islanders.  He is now giving her a means to beat the iron islanders with the new Kahl.  all she has to do is gain control of the Dothraki.  My bet is she is going to go back to the womb of the world convince all of the Dothraki to follow her in the biggest Kahl ever and then lead them to Maureen.  Or something along those lines.  She has also had problems controlling her Dragons.  But GRRM just added the plot device of the Giant dragon controlling horn.  The one problem is it kills whoever uses it by burning them.  But We have already been shown on multiple occasions that Danerys can not be burned, so when she uses it, it may give her control of her dragons without killing her.  Also GRRM has brought together quite a few major characters in Maureen.  it makes sense that he has brought them together so they can depart with Danerys.  Almost all the major characters in the area have come together at Mareen.     Does anyone know where to find a frame by frame of the CRS 6 landing?  During the explosion things fly by the camera so fast that you can't tell whats going on.   That may be helpful.  I think it is so cool that if you do something cool enough in this community you get flair for it.  Like the guy who made the website that simulates launches.   I feel like are data sets are somewhat limited lol.      I did not realize you were referring to the article oops.   Its easy to call other people out for their mistakes, but stuff happens all the time.  People are human and make mistakes.    It could be as simple as a miscommunication between two pilots while fueling the plane.  It would be short sighted to think that you will go though your aviation career without having or narrowly avoiding similar mistakes.     I think its time to stop feeding the dog, doggy treats.  It looks like he has a bit of a weight and balance problem lol.   And two broken legs.  What a great deal.   What is the pilot in command doing in the right seat?  is the lady getting training or something?

    All so true. However, let's also keep in mind he's number one in the polls now.      Sign me up please   I like the UX of it which may seem superficial but it is very important when you're searching. One of the quickest ways to frustrate someone with a search tool is by making it confusing just to use.  So far as the search, I typed in Mario Brothers 2 (looking for the 1980s game, NOT any current Wii, NDS or Gameboy games) and every post was relevant to the game I was looking for. Many search algorithms for larger engines whether it's Yahoo or Youtube (which doesn't have a good search function) do not work as well. If you type Mario Brothers 2 at Youtube, the top 10 items that come up are the aforementioned newer games.  While those with programming knowledge may have better insight, personally it works well for me.   	5
 I woke up a bit earlier this morning so that I could get to the post office when it opened at 9am. I arrived at 8:55am and there was already a bit of a line underneath the awning that read: UNITED STATES POST OFFICE. The sun was shining on NYC and the people waiting were negotiating who was last in line; preparing for the doors to open.  I was being my cheery self, offering quips like, "I wonder what I'll get!" and "the anticipation is like waiting in line for concert tickets!" and "the waiting almost makes it better, you know?"   The lady waiting next to me told me that they would open at 10am. We waited. I read a bit from my book and listened to music. Finally, a guy came out with a clipboard. People were showing their IDs and he was taking down their first and last names. People were allowed to enter six at a time.   I entered the building and it was a large elevator. One floor up and to my surprise it was a food pantry. I asked about the Post Office and was informed of its whereabouts half a block down the avenue.   So, in conclusion, I stood in line with people waiting to collect food for over an hour, saying things like, "I wonder what I'll get!" and "the anticipation is like waiting in line for concert tickets!" and "the waiting almost makes it better, you know?"  Horrible only begins to describe how I feel.      Exactly. The pro tip here is just TRY. Also, if the jacket isn't worth the time... don't bother.   It was a private message -- not public. The hospitality company, not the club made good. If you wanna research the legal blah blah it's called 'bailment'  Edit: bailment*   LPT: Always mention weird things            Friday the 13th, four leaf clovers, lucky rabbits foot... etc.   A Rasian in the Sun   Yeah, some dick cut her off.

Isn't that the type of reaction segregationists had to the Civil Rights laws of the 60s         I want to know if his parents are human and not ATMs.   What are Republicans going to say now that they have lost the same sex marriage case?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       	187
 That puppy calendar really ties the Thunder Zone together.   Rumsfield vs. Art, I can't decide who I liked more.        Martin Scorsese ends the film with a shot of the New York skyline which includes the World Trade Center Towers, even though the film was finished after the buildings were destroyed in the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. Scorsese chose to end on that shot rather then continue with a skyline without the WTC because the movie is supposed to be about the people who build New York, not those who tried to destroy it.   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217505/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv       The main two I experience in the Washington, DC area are these:  Guy approaches you on the metro or a popular tourist spot, says he is in the armed services on leave, had his wallet stolen, and needs some money to buy a bus ticket to get home to see his family.  In the areas outside of DC, Silver Spring, Bethesda, Arlington, there is always people that run up to you, usually well dressed, claim their car broke down, and need money for a tow.  They always run up to you pretending to be out of breathe, and always claim and try to provide evidence that they have a job.    	6
 I'm a girl...if a guy were approaching me at the bar he would need to be sober enough to hold a conversation with, and simply asking me for my name, and saying that I look familiar (or something dumb like that) would be enough to grab my attention.     "the front page of the internet"   A re-occurring dream I have is that I'm a kid playing on a playground with the Rugrats (yes the t.v. show), and I find a hidden doorway at the bottom of one of the play sets.  I open it and it's full of lava.  All of a sudden I see my mom coming up out of the lava asking me to come with her.  That's usually when I wake up.       I think the general population views me as nice...and for the most part I agree.  At the same time people can't read my mind, so they don't know what I'm actually thinking...  	5
                Just some subtle tweaks in light room but no filters   Yes. Its vacant not abandoned.  Power and water still running    Yes I am slowly adding more pics to this gallery, here are 13 pics  https://www.flickr.com/photos/rockandrollfreak/sets/72157650462291838/    yes vacant - as in not yet abandoned, but empty and no longer in use   Thanks, I'm in Ontario Canada.  you?         I don't add filters but I do often work with shadows, highlights etc to get my desired look and feel.  This was a dark room with a large window that provided a perfect amount of natural light - it's likely a combination of all these elements that make it look that way.   I dont do HDR         HAH, FOR SURE!            Second Pic you may enjoy  https://www.flickr.com/photos/rockandrollfreak/16949254087/                                 west end         right?                  You take a tuft of steel wool and place it inside a wire wisk, the wire wisk is attached to a rope or string  you set up the camera for a long exposure, light the steel wool and  spin the wisk - and you get this!   yay!!!!!!                        You "word nazi's" on Reddit kill me!!!!  Church, Cathedral...how the fuck do I know!!!  lol  Thanks for all the comments, upvotes and interaction!         Oh and it's Fisher Body, not Packard.   It's just a picture man, no need to over-think it.  When and where did I ever state that this was new and groundbreaking?    People will continue to flock to Detroit for the same old shit, just like I have, and will again.   adding one ray, ya good one.   Oh, and what is your preference, birds...trees, pretty shots of nature...of wait, how about frozen waterfalls?  That sounds like SO much fun!!!         hahaha yes, he does!  good eye   I'm a total exclamation point whore!!   lolol good one!!!   I am jealous as mother fuck right now!  Great set my friend!   I do, but they aren't posted yet   A google search will give you enough results with names and addresss!!   No doubt, I always come to Detroit with a crew.  Not that that would stop something from happening, but it lessens the chances I think         Thank you!         very cool   funnily enough, it had raccoon poop in it   hahahaha   More from this house here  http://www.freaktography.ca/abandoned-house-of-antiques.html   More from this house here  http://www.freaktography.ca/abandoned-house-of-antiques.html         Thanks, I only have what is posted, I won't post the entire exterior just incase someone in the city recognizes it and goes to loot all the stuff   you guys and your fallout comments!!  lol   Thank You!            Yes, the cupboard was fully stocked!!   Yes, I am adding pics to this album every day this week.  http://www.freaktography.ca/abandoned-house-of-antiques.html   Its no big thing,  i catch grief no matter what i post. Lol ...this IS The internet and is always to be expected.   I just thought some baseball fans might dig the shot!!   It's called "still life", I'm not interested in pointing my lens at a floor full of shit and garbage and call it a photograph. I like to search out odds and ends in these places and capture them.   I should have used different wording, "well used" maybe??   sorry - it LOOKS old!!            Before you ask/comment - yes I set this shot up, hard to shoot something that is buried under rubble!  More from this house here: http://www.freaktography.ca/abandoned-house-of-antiques.html   Before you ask/comment - yes I set this shot up, hard to shoot something that is buried under rubble!

I really need to see what "fallout" is because every pic I post gets some kind of a fallout related comment!!!   I can assure you, no one is doing shit to this house!!!!  Great fucking username BTW!!!!   lolol!!     Wow, I never imagined this would strike up such a debate!  I personally think "Take only pictures, leave only footprints" is one of the most annoying phrases and while I have used it in articles and blogs, I can't stand hearing it.  The only reason I used it in an article was because it was for public consumption (rather than just the exploring community) and when the general unknowing public hears something like that it gives them warm fuzzies!  I don't take stuff because I just simply don't want to, it's not mine to take so why take it.  But I don't think ill of those who do, who am I to judge.  It's just that simple for me, no need to over analyze the subject IMO.  I'm just there to take pictures  HOWEVER, the one thing I WISH I would have taken but didn't??  https://www.flickr.com/photos/rockandrollfreak/14710329566/in/set-72157637596393633   great fucking story man!!!!  Wow, thanks for sharing!!

Oh no - someone sets up photos, what a fucking idiot, who does he think he is!!!!!  For the record, this was like this when I found it, not to say someone else didn't set this shot up.  I will await your crusty internet bad-ass reply!  	128

Because when kill-rates are calculated (as described in the 1st paragraph of the Discussion section of the 2000 CDC study), then pit bull fatalities are not disproportionate compared to other large breeds:  1. Malamute: 15 fatalities  20 years  50,000 dogs = 0.015-per-1,000  2. Husky: 21  20  680,000 = 0.0015-per-1,000  3. Rottweiler: 44  20  1.9M = 0.0012-per-1,000  4. Pit Bull: 76  20  4.6M = 0.0008-per-1,000  5.

I think it's debatable whether there's been no significant rise in number of victims of mass shootings. It's a point convincingly argued by Northeastern's [James Alan Fox](http://hsx.sagepub.com/content/18/1/125.short) but also convincingly counter-argued by Harvard's [David Hemenway](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/mass-public-shootings-increasing-in-us/). I think it's more to the point that even Fox concedes that mass shootings have been a stable phenomenon for the past 20-30 years, which contradicts your implied argument that violence is on the decline (by citing gun homicide rates) and instead supports /u/djroomba__'s argument that "these killings will not stop."  Now if you want to argue against /u/djroomba__'s opinion that changes to gun laws   mental health care will reduce the frequency and number of victims of mass shootings, be my guest. Because as far as I'm aware, such conjecture is typically based on qualitative comparisons between policies in the USA vs. other countries and not on any scientific research.

The paper is a NBER working paper and is not published in a peer-reviewed journal. Please feel free to post it in our sister subreddit /r/EverythingScience.    Around 60% of dog attacks in the world are pit bulls only.  Do you have a scientific source that supports this claim or are you just exaggerating? The CDC found that around 50% of fatalities (not attacks) in the USA (not the world) were by pit bulls. The CVMA found that less than 10% of dog attacks in Colorado were by pit bulls. I'm unaware of any scientific study that looked at dog attacks worldwide.   They are banned in UK and New Zealand.  Pit bull-type dogs (as commonly understood in this thread) are not banned in the UK. Only purebred Pit Bull Terriers are banned by the [Dangerous Dogs Act 1991](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/65/contents). Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers and mixed breeds are all allowed in the UK. For example, [here is just one list of Stafforshire Bull Terriers available for sale to Londoners](http://www.pets4homes.co.uk/sale/dogs/staffordshire-bull-terrier/london/).   It is also banned in parts of Canada, after which dog attacks dropped by 80%.  Do you have a source that supports this claim or are you just exaggerating? Because I think you might have your numbers backward. The Toronto Humane Society conducted a [study in 2013](http://www.torontohumanesociety.com/pdfs/Breed_Specific_Legislation_Jan-14.pdf) which found that "dog bite rates in 36 Canadian municipalities found no difference between jurisdictions with BSL and those without." In particular, the number of bites by pit bulls decreased by 98% after BSL was enacted in Ontario ([as reported by the *Toronto Star*](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/10/03/pit_bulls_were_torontos_biggest_biters_before_the_ban.html)) but the number of bites by all breeds remained essentially unchanged: [5,428 in 2005 to 5,345 in 2009](http://www.citynews.ca/2010/04/28/number-of-bites-largely-unchanged-after-pit-bull-ban/). The only reference I could find to an 80% reduction in dog bites was in Calgary (from 10-per-10,000 people in 1986 to 2-per-10,000 people in 2006) but Calgary employs strong licensing   enforcement and not BSL.   But 1 in 10 will destroy someones life.  Do you have a source that supports this claim or are you just exaggerating? Because it seems like it's pulled out of thin air. [The Clifton report](http://www.dogsbite.org/dog-bite-statistics-study-dog-attacks-and-maimings-merritt-clifton.php) indicates that pit bulls are responsible for about 115 serious attacks per year and comprise about 6.7% of the dog population, so about 5.6 million. If the average pit bull lifespan is 12-14 years, then basic math tells us that 1-in-4,000 will destroy someone's life, not 1-in-10.

The following exist: -Almost any childhood cartoon you can think of has a porn spinoff -Amputee porn -Puke porn -Poop porn (disturbingly common) -Actual Donkey punching  However we did not find anything in the area of mental disability porn... so yeah, i suppose the only way to win that game was to end up on something that doesn't exist because it's a shameful thought in the first place.

 Well then... in terrified at four in the morning shouldn't... shouldn't have read that.   So the electric fence turned him into some sort of zombie.   I thought the other condo was showing you many ways you could die. For instance you said that you could barely afford your condo, so what if you get a loan from that guy and he kills you. And if you date that black haired lady she might kill you as well, so what if you killed yourself the first time you looked through the window because you couldn't handle the images anymore. So maybe you shouldn't look through the window anymore.   Yu know what would be funny? If the child was really some evil monster that looked like a human and if he wanted revenge, because you prevented him from eating more human flesh. Yep, very funny.   And the race begins...   Maybe death saved you as a baby and be wanted to check on you? I don't know.   Pretend to join them, then nuke all. No mercy, avoid the mind reader device and just bomb them!   It's probably the homeless guy living underneath my bed.   I see what you did there, and I'm kinda shocked about it too.   Well now my childhood is officially ruined, thank you.   Well, I think the ending was not surprising because this is nosleep  and I've read similar stories like this, sadly.    Interesting interesting, I need to read more of the story for entertainmen- err I mean research... yep.   Oh no! We got a normal person! Normal person alert! Kill it, kill it with fire!   No, I am everyone!   I kinda guessed it because the guy couldn't hear him.  	15
 If only there were already a comment here where I said what the difference was. If only if only.    Huh. Where I come from there's a strong difference. Redheads can have darker skin tones. The only requirement to being a redhead is having red hair. Ginger is a subcategory found within the redhead group. Gingers have pale skin, freckles, and very very red hair. They sunburn easily and have no souls.   Source for the lack of ginger souls: Eric Cartman    Damn. And here I thought I was being original.    Why did Sally fall off the swings?   Because she had no arms.    "Knock knock"  "Who's there?"  Not Sally    Way I heard it was with Sherlock Holmes. And his line was "because you're ugly as fuck"    Game of thrones. Shit you not I've seen the entire first two seasons in one sitting so far today. I need more hobbies.    You sick fuck    Follow someone around and keep unzipping their pants. Make sure that fly is always down.    Deeeedoooo dodeedeeedoooo. Doodeedeeeeeeeee   Bum bum bum. Buummmm bumbum. Buummm bumbum bumbuuummmm.    I can play it on piano :)    Red head or ginger? There is a distinction    He'll get around to finishing it later    Reading. All my life I've scored in the top 1% of the nation for critical reading. It's the only thing I truly excel at.    Pigs have orgasms that can last for up to 30 minutes.   The Allied powers in World War 2 tried to put female hormones in Hitler's food in order to make him more feminine and less capable of leading a war. (looks like they were more sexist back then too)   Because whales are so large, sometimes a third whale needs to swim underneath two copulating whales to hold them afloat and keep them from sinking.   Whales are also scientifically proven to be the best wingmen.    Because all objects accelerate downward at a constant speed of 9.8 m/s, any animal dropped out of a helicopter would fall at the same speed as the cow. Because a smaller object would have marginally less air resistance, it would fall faster. Therefore, due to physics, a frog dropped out of a helicopter would be faster than a cow.    Pobody's nerfect.    *cough* Doctor Who *cough cough*   Scientifically proven fact    What a language!      	21

Who cares right?       Going with the Obama slogan? Yeah people aren't tired of that one...   CU just doesn't care. It might get a bit better with Folsom Frenzy but people were quick to ditch basketball after 3 straight tournament appearances.

That's why were pending debt approval to update class rooms    Not when the state gives very little funding. Most of my university funding comes from federal research and tuition    Now you know why employers love interns    Put the corporations on a pedestal    45 hours * 4 weeks is 180. $1000/180 hours = $5.55/hour. They definitely have no obligation to give you benefits for an internship (seen as temporary employment especially if it's a summer internship) and a below minimum wage pay. Are you sure you're numbers are right?    Said this the last time this was posted, many people commenting this are at work    My university cut full time positions for students because they couldn't afford to give them benefits    A company wants profit? No way? That's the fucking point of business.    I was saying on one person but I'm a crowd    If you look at the Wisconsin map here you will see many seats in Milwaukee area but very large areas in the north west. We're not talking about Florida    EMT here. Cops don't need medical training beyond first aid/CPR. They already fuck up the little medical training they have. Their job isn't to make medical judgement, that's our job. Just like why firefighters cut people out of cars, not cops, there's a places for everyone in the system. Mess with who does what and it's a disaster.  There's literally nothing the cops could do for a seizure. Seizures require drugs that paramedics attend years of schooling in order to gain a license to give the drugs. Best case scenario for a seizure in a crowd- move patient out from the crowd if it is safe to do so, have Medics show up, Medics treat/transport On a side note, if you witness seizure, time how long it is and move things out of the way so the person doesn't get hurt.    Mom probably charged at cops when she saw the daughter   Spray is also worthless in small spaces or crowds    Or that highly populated areas that vote democrat also don't have the most districts.    So no hope during recall or reelection?    Pretty crazy how big cities vote democrat and thus get those seats but rural/majority of state area isn't necessarily Democrat    Because a huge amount of those votes were from the Milwaukee area. Those people vote democrat. How many districts are there in Milwaukee area versus the rest of the state? Edit- could it also be that not every democrat voted democrat? As in, do they base those numbers off of who got a vote or what the voter identified as? I know Democrats that voted Walker because they didn't like Tammy    Also what brought the program down...   People who still can't afford insurance now have less money to eat because of fines.   You're crazy to think he's made much of a difference in the middle east. The recession was part of the housing crash that was caused by people buying things they can't afford, not bush.   The health has caused premiums to rise and people who can't afford Obama care are now paying fines.    CSU- Last year wasn't a fluke!    Did you watch Colorado Utah last year? We almost pulled it off    Colorado Utah. Basically anyone alive for those days is old or dead now.

 I got a number one, and it felt really good to eat because I hit my goal weight a while ago. I usually carb load once a week anyways now. I wore the one white shirt I had. It's a little tight tank top that I haven't worn for years. I felt great and I think I looked great too with my little leather cow ears. Ha!   Fresh caprese salad. Fresh tomato, basil, mozzarella, cracked pepper and a drizzle of olive oil on top.    OMG IT'S PIKACHU DRESSED AS TOTORO!!!!!!!!    Can anyone find out how tall he is? I've searched for a while now but I can't find anything. I'm thinking he looks like he's about 5'5"-5'8".    dug*...I'm sorry.   I've only ever had one carb binge dream, and went I woke up I felt sick. I'd eaten and entire meat lover's pizza, three hotdogs with a bun, and a bunch of cookies. So glad it was a dream.   This is probably the most beautiful tourmaline specimen I've ever seen.   You have some awesome tools. Thank you for sharing this!    It sure is! Good eye!   This is super cool!      Fantastic! Might I add, you have the 'smolder' down pat. Ha!   DAAAAAMN! That's impressive! And I agree with everyone else, the beard should go. You look awesome! Congratulations!   Do want!!!   My husband bought me a super awesome flashlight. I strap it to my belt at night when I run. I leave the light on so cars can see me. It also has a strobe feature that comes in handy for self defense situations.    Aw, he's waving! Hi Satan!!! :D    Oh wow, hi! Haha! That sounds like so much work. I haven't shaved my legs in a week (but my leg hair is super fine and blonde too, so it's really hard to see) because I have super sensitive skin and I tend to break out. I tried the veet strips and had welts for over a week. I've never used an epilator before, it sounds painful.   Anyways, you look amazing and thank you so much for responding to me and for the kind words! :D   I love how puppies wiggle when they're really really happy.   I love how ridiculously derpy and happy they all look.    It makes me sad to know it will get smashed up. Looks like you put a lot of work into it.   	20

 Ironically I got 14.04 because it was LTS, and so it'd be bug free.  15.04 sorted that cocksucker out with one visit. ;D flawless. And the new background looks cool too!   I did. xD  Ran 15.04 instead now. No issues what so ever! :)   Should've gone to specsavers...  *10/10 marketing opportunity right there.*   No, but if you can put toothpaste back into the tube...  *Then you can put toothpaste back into the tube.*      Just installed 15.04  Not a single damn problem. Installed FLAWLESSLY. Video drivers and adapters were found and installed automatically via Ethernet.  I'm up and running with 0 problems.  [Time for some jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEL-HdWvLpM)   Peasants use Turtlebeach for their toyboxes.  It's got peasantry diseases. Turtlebeach is a no go. :)   I've installed Kali, Debian, Ubuntu, Yosemite, Windows, multiple times, on HDD and VMS, and never had an issue. But today Ubuntu wanted to kill me.  	8
 I could not agree more about Jade. She was my favorite ever since the cinderella episode. She's smart, funny. and fucking gorgeous. Jade if you somehow are reading this, will you marry me?

 Drunk Cersei was one of the highlights of season 2, so I'm pretty hyped for this season.   I'm upgrading from an MSI GTX 670 to an MSI GTX 970 4GB, my question is that do I need to uninstall and reinstall my graphics driver for this? The issue is that when I check Nvidia's website, the graphics driver for my current GTX 670 is exactly the same as the GTX 970 I'm upgrading to?  Check the supported products section here: http://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/80943/en-uk   This ought to be good.   	3
 I pressed the button by accident. Lucky 13 I guess...   Just wondering if I should wait to buy an unlocked G3. Thanks!   Aww man, I just tapped the touch pad on my laptop by accident! I know how you feel pal.   Every account on reddit is a bot except you.   Thanks! This looks promising.      This question may be a little odd, but I'm looking for as many different colored shirts as possible. Long sleeve and short sleeve but no button ups. I don't want logos, patterns or pictures, just solid colors. [This] (http://cdnd.lystit.com/photos/2013/05/07/old-navy-dark-green-heather-classic-vneck-tees-product-1-8542319-185125367_large_flex.jpeg) is the type of shirt I'm describing.   Ideally I'd like the widest selection of hues there can be so I can use them for a special project I'm working on in one of my classes.   Thanks for any help!   /u/trollabot train_subject3014   Woah, just, no words for this. 12/10   He was won in a game of charades.   John! Are you ever going to come visit New England? Maybe for a book signing/nerd fighter meetup?   I just bought a laptop for $200...      I dunno why you got downvoted,  I thought it was funny      I agree.  Can someone confirm the legitimacy of this?   I thought it might be special, oh well...   The blade says:   **STAINLESS** **PAKISTAN**      Turn my pages bitch!   55!   I'm in need of a phone and this will be the first that I ever own. Due to my relatively small budget I don't have many options. I've narrowed my choices down to a used Galaxy S3 from Craigslist, or a brand new Galaxy Grand Prime from Amazon. After reviewing all the specifications for both phones I've found that the Grand Prime has an edge with almost every feature; screen size, battery life, camera resolution, weight...  The S3 does have a few things going for it though. Twice as much ram (2GB vs 1GB) and twice as much internal memory (16GB vs 8 GB). Although the internal memory shouldn't be a problem because I plan to use an SD card to expand it. The S3 also has a few extra sensors that the Grand Prime doesn't, such as a gyroscope.  One major factor that I'm considering is the fact that the S3's screen has many cracks in it, and I really would love the q-hd screen the Grand Prime has.  Thanks for any information!  TL;DR: I think the title sums it up.  	22

 Just Gandalf the White saving New Zealand, nothing new.

So I told the people not to buy from them and they listened so my dorm mate and his friends threatened me because of it but ended up doing nothing.

 She's beautiful OP and you guys look like you made each other really happy. I'm sorry for your loss.    You right you right.    No homo?   Ssssoooooo... You love her?   This story starts on a Friday. I got really drunk and stopped by Taco Bell on my way home. Never a good idea but that shit is blaze when you're hammered.  The next day I couldn't leave my apartment because I couldn't leave the bathroom for more than 15 mins. It wasn't until about 4 pm that I felt safe to leave my place.  I called my buddy Stevie B and we decided to go into the city for the arts festival. We packed a couple book bags full of beer and headed down for a few hours.  On the way back to my place we decided to stop at the Burger King. Cuz we were drunk and that shit is blaze when you're hammered.  Now I'm usually pretty shy. I'm a polite guy and I usually don't like to be the center of attention but for some reason  (I'm guessing the alcohol had something to do with it) I decided it would be funny if I farted on Stevie B while he ordered.  As the lady read off his total I got into position. I backed up toward him until he was about a foot away, lifted my leg and pushed expecting to hear a fart followed by laughter. It ended up sounding more like a child blowing bubbles in his chocolate milk.  The lady behind the register and Stevie both looked at me with the what-the-fuck face. I stood there for a second looking at both of them trying to wrap my mind around the fact that I just shit myself in a Burger King. After standing there for what felt like forever exchanging glances with the two of them I managed to spit out the words, "I'll be right back." and I did a penguin like waddle to the bathroom to finish what I had started back at the register. I had to ditch my favorite pair of boxers in the bathroom trash can. The damage was far to great to save them. They weren't just my favorite boxers. They were my lucky boxers. RIP Never forget.  Anywhoo.. I must have been in there for a good bit because when I got out of the bathroom Stevie was just about finished with his food. I told him about having to leave my drawers behind as he finished up. He stood up, patted me on my back and said, "Well old boy. You win some and you lose some." Then he laughed really loud at me then we left.   Never trust a fart.   TL;DR Ate Taco Bell, got drunk and decided to try to fart on my buddy. Ended up pooping on myself.   	5

 Id put Concluding Unscientific Postscript near the top of the list.    Hillary cares.    People like you are the problem with this country:  Whatever works, as long as you get away with it.  Put the debt burden on our kids; we'll be dead by then.  Rah, rah, military - we must thank them for our "freedoms".  All in the name of a good investment.    Look at Great Britain, and Rome before them.  Empires don't last because of amoral short-sighted, greedy mentality.  You can cheer for it all you want, but don't pretend it is founded on anything substantive, and certainly not on anything good.  Call it what it is:  Might makes right.   This isn't anything unless and until it happens.  Let us know then.  And it still won't be much of a story.     Thanks for posting this!   That's like saying armed robbery is a very effective method of wealth reallocation, and an effective investment.   You're thinking for the short-term, not the long term.  And you're thinking for a limited category of people, the warmongers and banksters.  If you recalibrate for the long term for all citizens, your assertion is bogus.    Check the internet.  For one, she said the attack was due to an internet video, when emails/documents show she knew otherwise.  You can do the rest yourself.   She's not a normal person.   Well dont put so much in a voting populace that is lied to by their leaders and by the media, spied on by the NSA, etc. And dont claim realpolitik when these wars arent even declared by Congress, as per the Constitution. They are illegal wars.    War isnt good for our economic interests. It is only enriching the banksters and military industrial complex. Otherwise it is destructive and wasteful and life-ending, etc.    Every country is a potential treat.    You know damn well what he's talking about and pretending he just doesnt understand freedom in order to make a supposed point against that.    I was being sarcastic, and not only referring to that incident.    Hamilton could use a PR person.    Hogwash.  Rim protection over-stated?  Hardly.   Lame post. Such a gentleman?    Lame.   Yeah.  Riiiiiiiight.   If you are down on MBTI, then why care? Masterminds conveys pretty accurately what an INTJ is, in a word. There is nothing unhumble about it. We aren't bestowing it upon ourselves. Few would take it to be anything more than that. It certainly shouldn't be taken too literally or assumed to mean more than it can.    If a law is wrong, argue against the law. Don't argue against the "morons" who get the 3 strikes in a system designed to enrich itself off their victimless, non-violent "offenses" with perpetual imprisonment - all under the bogus cover of morality and justice, etc.    Reading this whole thread make me miss Al *a lot*.  Wish you were here, Al!  Rest in peace.   He used to live in the Oakland Airport Hilton during the season.   There are many thousands rotting away in California prisons for similar "offenses", due to the 3 strikes legislation.   Yes, it is generally acting instead of thinking/reflecting/analyzing. We do best on the move when we can enjoy and manifest and take advantage of our intuition and instinct.    Check out Taoism. Alan Watts' writings are a good starting point.    Amen.    A copy of Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling was sitting on the back of the toilet at my brother's place. Noticed it had a quote from a Dylan song on one of the first pages (from Highway 61). That was about 20 years ago. Was tranfixed with SK for a good decade. Have since moved on to other existentialists and Taoism most recently. It is the only real philosophy that touches everything in a person and elsewhere, because if the paradox and individualism and subjectivity of it all.    [Speaking of which, a proposal moving through Congress that rolls back protections for mobile home buyers would almost exclusively benefit Clayton Homes, a company controlled by billionaire Warren Buffett](http://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/05/18/17348/congressional-proposal-might-only-benefit-firm-was-subject-probe)   Don't just do something! Stand there!      Nobody here really believes Brady's story, so why are you surprised that Belichick wouldn't?  Biased reporting?  That would be beside the point.   Give us an example.    assumptions like what? i assume anyone tends to tell the truth more than politicians do. further, hersh has a record of single-handedly breaking some huge stories: my lai, abu garaib, etc., that were truer than any of the powers that be cared to admit.    yes, that's a good book too.   I'd much rather take Uber than any other type of taxi.  If you're trying to scare me into supporting the current price-gouging, protected-monopoly taxi companies, it's not working.   nbc and the nytimes have since corroborated it.  news in pakistan has corroborated it.  you really expect him to name the source?  now you sound like an administration spokesperson.  he names the source, the source spends the rest of his life in prison.  you want propaganda, watch "zero dark thirty", or try to make sense of the many various incomplete and contradictory explanations coming from the white house.  don't you think it's bizarre they never produced any photos of bin laden's body?  obama said that's because we don't "spike the football".  hogwash.  they released the video of saddam being hung, and guadafi being killed, etc.  the pictures don't correspond to their story, that's why they weren't released.   the government has taken those incentives away.  i'm currently unemployed.  it's not about more jobs or less jobs.  if it was, we could dig holes and fill them up.  "it" being standard of living.  the dollar used to go further (its value has been destroyed by the fed) - that is why women have to work.  that creates bubbles which all destroys the middle class.  government and banks have to get out of the way.  read irwin schiff's piece and check out fredric bastiat's "the seen and the unseen", and murray rothbard's "what has the government done to our money?"  very short and pdf's available online.   They only released this now to try to discredit Seymour Hersh's latest [article](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n10/seymour-m-hersh/the-killing-of-osama-bin-laden) which undermines the administration's whole story about the killing of OBL.   Most all of that is natural gas/fracking (oil) jobs.   ok, but if you buy into that, you're saying that only the thieves and fascists and banksters can be productive or allow us to be productive.  this only empowers them more.  government produces nothing.  banks produce nothing tangible, and usually just figure out clever ways to spend other peoples' money.  nothing productive from the rich or the powerful.  money didn't give us the productivity in silicon valley.  ingenuity in garages, etc., did.   Reminded me of the smiling Taoist in 'The Vinegar Tasters'.   Read [this](http://freedom-school.com/money/how-an-economy-grows.pdf).  Some of the most fundamental things anyone could ever learn about money and economy.  Money has nothing to do with productivity, and really doesn't have anything to do with survival.  Also, people could create their own jobs.  They shouldn't have to depend on the government or someone else to do it.  Yes, in many ways the powers that be have turned the Western world into a debt-slave culture and a dependent economy and have made it harder to get by:  predatory lending, bubbles one to the next, discouraging savings, etc.  But they have made the problem, and can't be looked to for a solution.     If you eat sugary fruits (like pineapple) every day, you could gain weight.    One good thing about wind energy (and probably other renewable sources) is that it *doesn't* require as many jobs/workers as conventional energy, freeing people up to do more productive things. Productivity is what increases the standard of living, not the number of jobs.    just watched it - a couple things:   the big mike was set up and never used. took up a lot if the frane. it also looked like it could have been pre-recorded. there weren't any long shots and ony one camera was used. it seemed like very different lighting too and a strange taping compared to usual musical performances on the show.    Two-dimensional = dystopia?   Easily The Road.   Then  Atlas Shrugged. Heart of Darkness. Brave New World.    This post got me reading Cannery Row today. Excellent book. The Taoist undertones are pretty cool. I know Im going to devour all of Steinbeck's stuff now. Thanks!   Yeah, there's enough of a Cormac-worship circle jerk here anyway. It has taken on a life of its own. This post isn't necessary. That book was out years ago.    You and me both. The most overrated book of all time.    Does anyone here like the story in this book, or any part of the content, or is it just Cormac's writing style that gets you so excited?   They should have at least let him *try* a 15 yard extra point.    yeah, it's a load of crap.    The word is a symbol and a delight which sucks up men and scenes, trees, plants, factories, and Pekinese. Then the Thing becomes the Word and back to Thing again, but warped and woven into a fantastic pattern. The Word sucks up Cannery Row, digests it and spews it out, and the Row has taken the shimmer of the green world and the sky-reflecting seas. Lee Chong is more than a Chinese grocer. He must be. Perhaps he is evil balanced and held suspended by goodan Asiatic planet held to its orbit by the pull of Lao Tze and held away from Lao Tze by the centrifugality of abacus and cash registerLee Chong suspended, spinning, whirling among groceries and ghosts. A hard man with a can of beansa soft man with the bones of his grandfather. For Lee Chong dug into the grave on China Point and found the yellow bones, the skull with grey ropy hair still sticking to it. And Lee carefully packed the bones, femurs, and tibias really straight, skull in the middle, with pelvis and clavicle surrounding it and ribs curving on either side. Then Lee Chong sent his boxed and brittle grandfather over the western sea to lie at last in ground made holy by his ancestors.      Mack and the boys, too, spinning in their orbits. They are the Virtues, the Graces, the Beauties of the hurried mangled craziness of Monterey and the cosmic Monterey where men in fear and hunger destroy their stomachs in the fight to secure certain food, where men hungering for love destroy everything lovable about them. Mack and the boys are the Beauties, the Virtues, the Graces. In the world ruled by tigers with ulcers, rutted by strictured bulls, scavenged by blind jackals, Mack and the boys dine delicately with the tigers, fondle the frantic heifers, and wrap up the crumbs to feed the sea-gulls of Cannery Row. What can it profit a man to gain the whole world and to come to his property with a gastric ulcer, a blown prostate, and bifocals? Mack and the boys avoid the trap, walk around the poison, step over the noose while a generation of trapped, poisoned, and trussed-up men scream at them and call them no-goods, come-to-bad-ends, blots-on-the-town, thieves, rascals, bums. Our Father who art in nature, who has given the gift of survival to the coyote, the common brown rat, the English sparrow, the house-fly and the moth, must have a great and overwhelming love for no-goods and blots-on-the-town and bums, and Mack and the boys. Virtues and graces and laziness and zest. Our Father who art in nature.   Are we still expecting a refresh/release after Skylake comes out?  Are we still expecting a body redesign similar to the 13" anytime?  Recently got my MacBook Pro stolen, and am wondering if I should hold off and wait, or buy this one now.  I could wait 6-8 months if I was somewhat certain Skylake and/or a redesign was coming.    Remember Al-Qaeda in Iraq was ISIS before it was rebranded.  Well done.  But I don't get the above sentence.  This is saying that ISIS already existed.  Can you provide, or link to, some history or context on this?  When did the rebranding occur?  Was *this* ISIS also created by the CIA?  Thanks.   I think he's in the new Mad Max movie.       One of my favorites lyrically for sure.    I think his character is excellent. I love it when he gets so frustrated with Danny and yells fuuuuuck!   Kobe couldve had more if he could play with a team. Lakers fans will talk about those championships forever. They will hold them up like a shield against any mention of the present (and future) reality: "Yea, 5 rings. Let's give Kobe $48 mil because that makes perfect sense!!!"   They sure did. While the Black Mamba was playing video games with his game face on.    There is a difference between being a cellar dweller for decades, owned by Donald Sterling, and having one if the best records in the league over four years. (We have the third best record since Chris Paul got there for years ago.) Magic is trying to create some stigma that just isnt there. They bombed game 6 and 7, but to say that means they are the team they've always been is a freaking lie.    Charity = tax deduction, fyi   Sure, but that amendment isn't constitutional.     Doc already said they're offering DJ the max contract.  Said DJ really likes it there.   Kellerman, you've only been paying attention to the Lakers woeful season all the goddamn year, playing to the Laker market.  We don't care what you think.   I said the *taxation* part, not the *double* part.  But anyway, if something happens all the time, that doesn't make it constitutional, fyi.   The *taxation* part.   I was a fan of Showtime in the 80's (up until the Kobe era), but not a fan of Magic anymore.  This comment was clearly directed at the Laker fans who can't handle the Clippers success.  What's he talking about?  *Everything* about the Clippers has changed in the last few years.  If they don't win a championship, they're "cursed"?  Trying to define these guys by their past is beyond disingenuous, and he knows it.   If Magic hadn't been hanging out with Sterling's girlfriend, Sterling wouldn't have said those things about "black people", and wouldn't have been forced to sell the team.  We're having success today thanks to you, Magic!     Yeah, I like Corey Brewer too.  Him and Ariza.  Wish the Clips had them.   One of the two LA teams is living in the past, and it's not the Clippers.      So you're an existentialist then?     A lot of people say they want higher taxes, but none of them want to lead an organized movement to do so. And no change in policy is even required.    Why doesnt he put his money where his mouth is and pay more in taxes instead of hiding it in his foundation? No one is stopping him. The same goes for his buddy, Warren Buffett.    If I were Doc Id make dJ undergo hypnotherapy.    They arent trying hard enough. Gotta want it!!!   The league has to step up their fining of floppers, or the NBA is going to look like World Cup soccer before too long.   Yeah, Blake could shoot a little more, at least as his first option.  Back em down, and at least draw a foul.   Without Harden and his flopping, they're a respectable team.  I can't take Curry and Green.  Go Rockets, though I won't be watching.   It is only the media echo chamber.  None of them could answer that question.  That said, I think he's a pretty good coach.  Though I couldn't say why.  He gets out of the way and lets the players play.  He's a "player's coach".  But these guys needed some serious coaching.  They rely on talent, and that goes a long way.  But when push comes to shove, and the pressure is on, when they are psyching out, or not doing what they can do, they need some serious coaching.  Because they just seize up.  For starters, he should tell Blake to just back it down to the hoop every time.  He only drew one foul in the second half, and shot 2 free throws.  It's great that he scores almost 30 every night, but he could have 50.  But there are so many other things....  Basically, what does Doc do when the heat is turned up and the pressure is on?   In 2012-13 we had: Matt Barnes / Chauncey Billups / Eric Bledsoe / Caron Butler / Jamal Crawford / Willie Green / Blake Griffin / Grant Hill / Ryan Hollins / DeAndre Jordan / Lamar Odom / Chris Paul / Ronny Turiaf /  Neil Olshey was the GM (now with Portland), and a good one. But we also had Donald Sterling, and there has been a recovery period since he and Olshey left.  How did we lose a team with a the best bench in the league to get a team with one of the worst benches in the league?  We didn't play our cards right.  Ballmer, if you're reading this, please get us a good GM.  ASAP.   Step #1: Get a GM.  Doc can't do it.   I like him, but yes, we have to let him go.  Can't jump, gets his shots blocked always, commits silly fouls.  As much a liability as anything.   And Ariza.  He's been a stud since his days at the Lakers, who never should have let him walk.  How did the Clippers pass over him?  We have to sign players that don't have liabilities.  Except for DJ's free-throw shooting - that is about all we might be able to live with, especially if the NBA fixes that ridiculous rule in the off-season.    Our prime search should be for a GM.  We had Olshey - now he's with the Blazers.   Big time wake up call.  As if Game 6 wasn't enough.  Doc can't be GM anymore.  Need a bench and some guys that can step up other than CP3.  Blake needs to get some attitude.  He should be getting 50/20/10 every night.  Where were Barnes/Crawford/Redick?   Yep, exactly. I like Doc but he cant be GM next year.   Neither   Yep. They tend not to see that banks, etc., are just as potentially evil.    2-bit philosophy: should humans have animal rights?   Before she died, she told them, "Over my dead body!"   ....with US help.    When Blake arrived.    And if the interaction *is* recorded, the officer still *may* be subject to a discipline process.    This guy is talking about a lot of things in a very helpful way to me. Im trying to write a comparitive paper about the Tao of "x" and even though it is all crystal clear in my mind the words and text are extremely difficult to put together. he's touching on a lot of the reasons why, reasons I hadn't thought of before.    The future is just as real as the present or the past.    "Primary?" You're making my point. No one is talking about primary.    To be brutally honest, you're not getting his point in the least.    When people aren't optimistic, it bums me out.    We arent optimistic or pessimistic. and you cant be/have one without the other. these are artificial labels we apply to things and to ourselves that obscure reality and communication. we should seek reality.    Any kind of law is a joke. Coercion, even if supposedly well-intended, makes a mess of things. Harmony should be the goal.    yeah that is what libertarians and some anarchists call the NAP. non-agression principle. dont mess with me or take my stuff.    The fact that immunity is even a question is one of the many things wrong with the police system in this country.   Get rid of the police officers bill of rights for starters.    The title of the post is not true.  Further, Bob Dylan will appear the day *after* Vedder.  http://www.bobdylan.com/us/news/bob-dylan-perform-late-show-david-letterman   Some might, but it's dumb to think that's the only reason. Especially when politics is involved.    yeah i heard that. i think it was mentioned in one of the games, but not sure. ive liked ariza since he was with the lakers.    Right, though getting Big Baby makes me wonder.  He is a player with a lot of limitations.  Then he passed over Ariza and got Hawes, though many thought Hawes would contribute much more.  Ariza is a stud, and good at defense.  Would have fit in well.    Yes, but Doc the GM is responsible for not having a bench that can be relied on.    He didn't just give them $75K out of the kindness of his heart.  What did he get in return?      Exactly. We have to close out games! We cant seize up and hope to run the clock out. We play better when we push the ball and create opportunities. We have talent, but we need to use it at will, not just whenever it happens. CP3 gets it.    Whatever happens this season, however it ends, Doc can't be GM next year. We need a reliable bench like what we had in 2013.   I fault Doc for not telling the team that when something is working, do more of it. Like get it to Blake inside. They cant guard him with one man. Seems like after a while Blake starts passing too much.   We also stopped pushing the ball in the 4th quarter. Went to a hesitant half-court game.   This team needs to be able to finish off games. Hopefully this was a wake-up call, and not the end of the season.    he kills their offense because hes such a one man show. and always at the foul line or trying to draw fouls. no one else can get in rhythm.    Usually they are a 'rescuer' type looking to be needed, and misreading everything.    Lead with competence and by example. Dont lead like a mindless choleric.    it is more about harmony, which is something that prevents problems and doesnt exacerbate the ones that exist. if problems are attacked with force or good intentions they get worse. force itself is a problem. harmony is key.    Tim Donaghey talked to him a lot by phone during the game-fixing scandal, according to records. But Foster was never charged with anything for some reason.    Who are the other two?  I'm guessing Joey Crawford is one of them.   Because I don't enjoy his prose enough to read that much of it.  So I'm not going to call him pretentious based on that, and certainly not in the same way as Cormac.  Yet, at least.  For whatever reason, I gave Cormac much more of a chance, or chances.  Cormac is all about himself, not his writings.  They're so bleak because that's the best he can do.  The bleakness doesn't have any merit on its own.  How many times is he going to use the same adjectives, like "thin"?   Far back beyond the mountain a **thin** wire of lightning glowed briefly. "The last **thin** paring of the old moon hung over the distant mountains to the west." "He lay on his back in the gravel, the earth's core sucking his bones, a moment's giddy vertigo with this illusion of falling outward through blue and windy space, over the offside of the planet, hurtling through the high **thin** cirrus.  "The man sat watching the road, the weed stem twirling in his mouth and the the reed **thin** shadow of it going long and short upon his face like a sundial's hand beneath a sun berserk."  ....for starters.  Goddamn it's painful just to read that here.  Totally self-absorbed, and unnatural, and necessarily repetitive.  Just because *The Road* makes you long for the end of the world, doesn't mean Cormac is skilled at evoking an end-of-days kind of feeling.  His writing doesn't *evoke* bleakness, it is itself bleak.  There is a big difference, which most can't distinguish.  If Cormac wants to make a tour-de-force, he should focus on his writing and let it speak for itself, not use his writing as a vehicle to say "look at me!".  Great writers disappear.  Every time we see missing punctuation in Cormac's text, we're distracted and reminded that it's all supposed to point to him.  Many people so badly want to believe that they willingly fall for this trick.   "It is a great adventure to contemplate the universe beyond (hu)man(ity), to think of what it means without man  as it was for the great part of its long history, and as it is in the great majority of places. When this objective view is finally attained, and the mystery and majesty of matter are appreciated, to then turn the objective eye back on man viewed as matter, to see life as part of the universal mystery of greatest depth, is to sense an experience which is rarely described. It usually ends in laughter, delight in the futility of trying to understand. These scientific views end in awe and mystery, lost at the edge in uncertainty, but they appear to be so deep and so impressive that the theory that it is all arranged simply as a stage for God to watch mans struggle for good and evil seems to be inadequate."  ~Richard Feynman   Exactly.  Some places the pedestrian legally has the right of way when they are dressed in black jumping out in front of buses at night.  Why would the pedestrian *want* the right of way anywhere but at a controlled intersection?   No.   Spectacular at being pretentious.    ....and look both ways before crossing the street - whether you are at a crosswalk or not. Why just assume people in cars would stop, especially when not stopping could kill you?   Cormac tries to damn hard, and it's obvious. He writes much more for his own recognition than for the story.   Hamburglar   Because they arent good writers. Because they are discussing things that havent been discussed much, if at all. Because they are writing usually for fellow academics.   But it is primarily that they arent good writers. Some philosophers are excellent writers, like Kierkegaard.    They aren't equivalent. Drawing Muhammad isnt wrong in any other context. Saying nigger is wrong in any context, unless you're a black rap artist.    Not really.  Police shouldn't be in the business of rehab either.  I know it's good that this isn't news of another police shooting or abuse, but let's not go overboard.  Let me know when their police union is no longer advocating long prison sentences for non-violent "crimes" like drug use.   Just YAC, baby!      If he were really a rationalist he wouldn't wear his short-sleeved shirt over his long-sleeved shirt.    The People's Republic of Santa Monica.    Seymour Hersh is an American.  NBC has backed his reporting.  NY Times has backed a lot of it and said the rest is likely true.   You have to pay about 40% of what you earn to the government every year.    Data such as???  Magical revelation in a dream.    If God manifests himself to you, you'll believe in him, regardless of what you think of free will, etc.  You won't really have a choice.   Well, he calls us his children, and calls himself our father.  I wouldn't say children and treating people like children trivializes their existence.  God himself tells us to be like little children all through the Bible.    We certainly aren't capable of understanding the why of things even as adults.  This is obvious.  We are adults, but we still are finite and mistake-prone, etc.    Christians have a lot of knee-jerk responses to this kind of thing that don't pass the slightest scrutiny.  They make declarations like it is sacred to be treated like an adult.  Who cares if you're treated like an adult if you have no way of seeing how he's treating you, hearing his voice, etc.?  Is the fact that he is so mysterious and so silent due to his desire to not be easy on us, to treat us like adults?  Whether he trivializes our existence or not is a ridiculous point and a trivial point.  Who cares if your existence is trivialized or not?  And actually, it is trivialized if you suffer and die within a half hour of birth - or a gazillion other examples.  Christians hang their hats on empty pronouncements like this.  Basically, it comes down to God says so, so it must be.  But any interrogation of it fails.  And their arguments are buttressed by their sheer emptiness and lack of relevance to anyone who hasn't already subscribed to their baseless points.   Is that faith based on the presence of God or the absence of God?  Does he make himself so obvious that we can't help but put trust in him?  Or is faith required because of his lack of manifestation?   Yes, but God is a loving all-knowing father, who created us.  So he's not just letting us learn on our own like an addicts parents or whatever.  If anything, since he's God, not a human, he should be even more obviously in our favor than any human analogy would describe.   Do you *choose* to believe the sky is blue?  What is the object of a person's faith?  What/Who is their faith *in*?  How do they know that object?  Through revelation.  If they have revelation, it isn't faith.  Your post isn't that substantive.   Appeal it on what grounds?  The Patriots didn't even cooperate fully.  That it was too harsh of a punishment?  Terrelle Pryor got five NFL games for trading his signature for a tattoo - in college.  They have no standing, and that is why they might to outside the league.  Another thing:  These guys didn't just deflate balls, they went into the referee's room and took the balls out to do it.  Not a gray area.  Not something that all the teams do.  Not equivalent to sticking the balls in front of a heater.   We'll never know.  Why not give another interview, especially if you're telling the public that you're cooperating fully with the investigation?   Right, I should say "the God of the Bible".    Many here are talking about  the *concept* of god, which is difficult to discuss because it can mean literally anything imaginable and more, not necessarily a God who declares himself a loving Father, the Good Shepherd, etc., even though that's what they might really mean.   We don't have free will, if our apparent choices are limited by God and if we have no control over the consequences of those choices, etc.  Any choice is an illusion.  Reality occurs outside the concepts and words that fill our heads and with which we communicate.  Put another way:  We need omnipotence/omniscience to have free will.  There is no reason to talk about free will in such a limited world.    (Just chiming in, not arguing with you.)   A Taoist would reply that good and evil are necessarily unified.  You can't have one without the other, and they are one and the same (yin yang).  Yet he would also say that good-evil is only an artificial concept that is applied to nature, not intrinsic to nature itself.  As such, it is an illusion and a deception to the degree that we assume otherwise.     Yes, it is *very* analogous.  The parent-child analogy is perhaps the most relevant.  Parents simply don't let their kids have choices, because they know better than to let the kid jump in the pool, or take the car for a spin at age 8, or whatever.  They aren't given free will because their parents love them and want to protect them from themselves.    On the other hand, Christians say, "How great it is that we have free will and God loves us enough to not make us robots or slaves.  But, darn it, too bad Adam and Eve ate the apple and ruined it for everyone.  But that's what happens when you have the ability to make your own choices."  A loving father would never treat his children the way God treats his children.  He wouldn't make himself mysterious, unheard, confusing, leaving them to fend for themselves so they can learn the hard way, suffer, etc.    But further, *we don't have free will*.  You don't have free will without omnipotence.  It isn't free will if your choices are limited by someone else, and the results and consequences of those choices are determined by someone else.  It is not free will to be given the choice to eat the apple or not eat it, or else....  What if you don't want to be forced to make that choice and don't want those consequences?    Heck, is faith even a choice?  Do you choose what you believe?  And if you choose what you believe, is it really a choice if the consequence of not believing is eternity in hell?   Me too.  I laughed hard after Danny spotted Kevin watching him from his truck across from the gas station.  When Danny walked away, Kevin hit the ceiling of his truck and yelled, "Fuck!....Fuuuuuck!!!"  Hilarious.   The few. The proud. The Marines.    No way is it too harsh. Brady lied to everyone and tried to charm us into thinking he would never do such a thing. He didn't cooperate with the investigation. Neither did the Patriots. But they said they did. They have a culture of cheating and lying.   They deserve whatever punishment they get. Goodell happened to get this one right.    Watch it again. He touched both hands to the ball before it was fumbled.  Edit: No one even heard of the Tuck Rule until the next day.   Tom Brady denied it, lied to everyone.  He didn't cooperate with the investigation.  Nor did the Patriots.  Then they said they did cooperate.  He's a liar to his core.  (I remember when he lied about throwing the "tuck rule" fumble - he said he was passing it for Christ's sake.)  They deserve whatever they get.  Glad Goodell *finally* showed some testicular fortitude.  I was starting to wonder if he wasn't in some secret discussions with Brady's lawyers.  EDIT:  Downvote and run without a rebuttal if you can't handle the truth.   This is the *one* he got right.     He's "good" at it and the refs go for it a lot.  I wouldn't say it should be taught as a fundamental like dribbling, passing, or shooting.  It is the fault of the refs as much as anyone.   Maybe you are thinking too much. Like we all do. Use your intuition to see things as they are without putting a pre-established conceptual framework over it. Everything can be reduced to generalities, but only through our minds and the language they use. Most other people get caught up in this too, rituals, expected behaviors, habits, which doesnt help. Just remember, actual reality is not that way.    I agree, the way Barnes and Redick are playing him is most of it, but the Joey Crawford crew was calling all of that and more in game 2.   Now he can call Goodell a liar without getting suspended for 3 weeks.   Playing like that appears to be catching up with Harden.  When the refs don't call those fouls, it has to be embarrassing for him.  Messes up his whole mentality as a player when Option #1 doesn't work at all.   Check out the story of Judyth Vary Baker.   They developed this vaccine in response to the CIA trying to kill Castro with lung cancer.  He smoked cigars and this would allow the CIA plausible deniability.  Check out the story of Judyth Vary Baker.  She was recruited by the CIA to work on this cancer - the cancer, not the vaccine - secretly at the Roswell Cancer Institute and in New Orleans for Dr. Alton Ochsner (who was one of the first to connect smoking with lung cancer).  Baker developed a fast-acting cancer, testing it on mice, for the purpose of assassinating Castro.  In a related story, Jack Ruby (yes, the guy who killed Lee Harvey Oswald) died of lung cancer while in jail.  Toward the end of his life he was injected with large bore needles, and suspected they were giving him this cancer.  He was aware of the work going on in New Orleans.  Very soon after being injected, sure enough, he contracted lung cancer and died.  The CIA, et al, didn't want him to talk.   Why do we care what Kobe thinks?   Who were the other two teams?   All the time. People even say it about the people I draw. I couldn't care less.   	164
 Bruno   Definitely Southpaw. ooooooooo the suspense is killing me!!!!!!!   OMG! OMMFCSDVRQQPQFG! YOU SAW HIM TOO??? HAH! Well guess what, smart guy! I saw him at the [2:57](https://youtu.be/PLLQK9la6Go?t=2m57s) mark! BET YA DIDN'T CATCH THAT, DID YA?   The Place Beyond the Pines   camel toe, checking in    [no reason](http://i.imgur.com/NOECI0s.gifv)   I hope I can be as cool as you one day.   he's also an executive producer    Notice that I said end credits, not beginning credits (nothing can top the True Detective beginning credits theme).   Perhaps I'm too much of an optimist for thinking reddit has moved on. [sigh]   yeah I like Matty Boo Boo too   Brno  I'm sorry, it's a guilty pleasure movie for me, alright?  don't judge me   love that song   funnier   Assuming you are not a kid, Trainwreck.   I've seen all three, and this is my order: Nightcrawler, Whiplash, then Kingsman. All three are great, though.   [rolls eyes]    oooooooooo my Jakey Bear continues to surprise me!   Exactly (at least that's how it should be). The reason I made that comment is because of the relentless Chris Pratt circlejerk. Almost everyone on reddit fucking worships the guy. It's annoying.    [rolls eyes] of course he is...   For me it's Jake Gyllenhaal (AKA Jakey G and Jakey Bear).    No, Spirited Away is perfect as is.   Jules Winnfield is a Bad Mother Fucker (BMF). Nothing scarier than that.   The Hateful Eight for Best Picture  Samuel L. Jackson for Best Actor  Jennifer Jason Leigh for Best Actress  Quentin Tarantino for Best Director  Zo Bell for Best Actress in a Supporting Role  Tim Roth for Best Actor in a Supporting Role  The Hateful Eight for Best Original Screenplay  Japanese dubbed version of The Hateful Eight for Best Foreign Language Film  Any song from The Hateful Eight for Best Original Song  Animated version of The Hateful Eight for Best Animated Feature Film  Robert Richardson for Best Cinematography  Anime version of The Hateful Eight for Best Writing Adapted Screenplay  The Hateful Eight for Best Visual Effects  okay you guys get the idea   Goodfellas lacks one key plot element: a Bad Mother Fucker (BMF). Pulp Fiction all the way.   Natalie Portman  Oh wait, I think it might be because I'm a straight 18-year-old male human being.   Just got off work. THERE'S STILL TIME TO MAKE HISTORY.   "Those are my muffins! You give me back my muffins!"  Life lesson: *Never* let a humanoid horse take your muffins away from you.   Wait, some of you guys are already done binging? whoa, I'm impressed   you rebel    Brno      How does this compare to the other Judd Apatow films?   Do you wish you saw Trainwreck instead?   I *loved* seeing my Jakey Bear in Donnie Darko and then all grown up in Nightcrawler. I am tensely awaiting Him to bless me with His acting in Southpaw. What to watch as an appetizer?   1. The Hateful Eight (Tarantino, enough said)  2. Southpaw (my Jakey Bear is starring)  3. The Revenant (same director as Birdman, so I am very interested)  4. Crimson Peak (del Toro haunted house film)  5. Jane Got a Gun (it's Natalie Portman starring in a western)   Don't really have time to watch both this weekend. have to go to a wedding   Is anyone else here going to watch Trainwreck instead of Ant-Man? I'm getting really sick of Marvel movies (I didn't even watch the new Avengers), and Trainwreck actually looks like a pretty solid comedy.   "I'm committing carbicide."    the muffins one  "Those are my muffins! You give me back my muffins!"   haha no   For me it's definitely the muffins one. Just thinking about it puts me in a good mood.   Back to the Future? More like Blast from the Past, am I right? Am I right? [sigh] I'm not right, am I?   this isn't r/gossip. the only thing about him that I care about is his acting   hopefully it's a Red Dead sequel, but I have no way of knowing if this is really their next project; this is just what I want it to be   how much   No. He's just a bothersome bloke.    Brno    Sammy L is a confirmed BMF. Mr. Neeson would not stand a chance.   Only one of these men is a Bad Mother Fucker (BMF). What else needs to be said?   act 1: im still his daddy i can give him stuff.   act 2: sorry son but u remind me of that time i killed a baby boy's father, so u are getting zero attention from me.   act 3: my daddy killed ur daddy. u mad brah?   ah fuck, I guess I gotta cancel my meeting with HBO   Just like any sane person would, I would of course choose Buffy the Vampire Slayer.    There's something inside you  It's hard to explain  They're talking about you boy  But you're still the same   Well he was the star for like the first 40 minutes...   ah damn, I fucking loved that   The Place Beyond the Pines   being able to alienate myself from everyone I know   Then you'll love The Place Beyond the Pines. Watch it.   No. Fuck no.   who the fuck doesn't like Lou Bloom?    Mine is The Place Beyond the Pines.   No, but it is an annoyance.    Check out my cake day presents! Nothing. Everyone hates me.   Sega Genesis   OMG THIS IS SO SEXIIIIIIST CHRIS SHOULD GET MORE MONEY #MASCULINISM   but seriously, if Chris Pratt was being paid more, there would be a fucking riot. just saying   I know that I was not in a car meet when I last played the game. Every single time I start it up, I am in an online car meet. Why? It is really getting annoying. If I want to play online, I'll choose to do it, but right now I'm playing by myself.

Wait... it's being sold separately????? fook yah!!!!!!!!!!   Wow. Thanks for the detailed response!   I am 18 years old and have attractive facial features. Blonde. I used to be pretty muscular, but I was hospitalized for anorexia last year, so I pretty much have no muscle now. I'm at a healthy weight now, but I haven't really been lifting weights lately, so I probably have less muscle than the average male, and therefore am less masculine than most men. I'm around 5'11" by the way.    Yes. (I'm being interviewed by a female of around 60 years of age or so.)   Halo, Gears, Forza. Boom.   Wow. Did you think I was being serious? lol   I have an interview at a health food store in about five hours. This is my first job interview, and I'd really like to get this job because I'm very interested in health food and supplements. What should I wear? Should I wear a tie, or is that too much? Hair spiked or combed to the side? Tips?       Well, yeah, but obviously I was saying vocals are important to a band which incorporates vocals into their music.   WHAT??????????????????????   I think it's vocals by far. There can't be a Smashing Pumpkins without Billy, right?   Alright, I see what you mean. Maybe I'll just get the digital version so that I won't have to look at the Kojima-less case on the shelf.    The Witcher 3. Yeah, it just came out, and you probably think it's the thrill of playing through a new game talking, but this really has everything I want in a game. It's perfect.    I said the same thing you'll receive no support here.   Honestly not trying to be a grammar nazi, but I just do not understand what you are saying.    Yeah, but seriously? Is Konami run by a bunch of children? This is just fucking juvenile.    cancelled pre-order. no kojima name on cover, no sale. hashtag sorry not sorry    cancelled pre-order. no kojima name on cover, no sale. hashtag sorry not sorry    cancelled pre-order. no kojima name on cover, no sale. hashtag sorry not sorry   Sorry, didn't see it.   yeah you have to wait until next week to get it if you don't have the season pass      Did anyone see 'Amy' this weekend  Yes. You did.   US 9.5   It would be pretty cool if he put in some Smashing Pumpkins like he did in Watchmen.   Oh I forgot about that one. Maybe I'll watch it again.    I think the tattoos illustrate the character's impulsiveness.    I really like Nightcrawler, American Psycho and Se7en. What are some others I should watch?   Especially if it ends with the Joker doing something really fucked up.    Alrighty, then.      haha, you beat me to it   Your username is "PMme_JonahHill_nudes."  Are we supposed to take you seriously?     damn right   Spirited Away   The Place Beyond the Pubes   Point Break   Brno    I might check out that new cut of DOFP.

You should also check Blue Valentine out (same director and screenwriter).   The Place Beyond the Pines   The Aquaman movie directed by James Cameron starring Adrian Grenier.    That's not Ben Affeck, that's Henry Cavill. Also, I thought Amy Adams was a woman. Jesse Eisenberg looks a lot like her.  EDIT: Sorry about the stupid joke.

I find this fact both fun and informative, thank you.   When you're right you're right, I dont know anything about their finances, but that's not what was being discussed.   Being a games developer, as you are, do you any input on my above comment past "You dont know about how they handle their finances"  Do you think I am wrong or have a misguided view on how easy it would be to apply a language patch the original PSP game?  In your experience how long would something like that take? how many staff? Would there be any licencing hurdles they'd have to jump over to get the game out on another platform? HOw long would the certification process take before distribution was feasible? Would the cost of these things outweigh the potential profit?  Or you could just give another witty retort.   Hi. I specifically said Type 0 PSP, nothing about the HD version.  They do not need to port anything, the PSP version is there, complete, ready to go, albeit in Japanese. The fan base did their own translation and patched in themselves.   Square Enix can release it to the west as is, if they wanted Or they could apply an official english patch (Which would be easier now since they have the entire game translated thanks to the HD release) With little work. I'm not saying no work, I'm saying negligible work for a company that size.  Once more for reading comprehension sake, I said Type 0 PSP. Not Type 0 HD.   Type 0 is a psp game. The vita has psp emulation. All they need to do is apply a translation patch and release it on PSN.  Dont say its not that easy either because that is exactly what the fan base has done.   They can and did.  Unreal Tournament III on PS3 had mod support that you could import via usb.   Guess I'm in the minority here but I got bored of it really fast, played it for a week and havent touched it since. None of my friends are playing it either...

Sure can, the handle is on the left.    Look all I'll say is you are not the target demographic for those films and thats fine.  The number of quality movies made on lower budgets with little to no special effects far surpass the Hollywood dribble you obviously take issue with.   As with everything in life if you rely purely on face value / advertising you will get the most superficial crap around. That's where you're at now.  So, go do some research yourself, take a risk and watch some international films, they are plentiful and you'll find quality thought invoking films from the world over.  Or you can sit on the internet and complain how you only see "geek culture" permeating theaters... Either way I dont care, I know there are thousands of films made each year catering to all audiences. You too can take advantage of that or just take whats thrown in your face by Hollywood advertising.   Burnout Dominator is better, though I think you need a PS3 to transfer it across.   No it really doesnt, this screams publicity.   His agent probably heard the news of the guy and his Gosling cereal shtick and how he'd just died.

I got this [Pacman tat](http://i.imgur.com/S6dSF.jpg) years ago.   [It's faded allot since I got it](http://i.imgur.com/bF2Ia.jpg)   Bullshit, pure and simple.  You may see superhero movies advertised more this is a given with their larger advertising budgets, this does not mean there has been a decline in the quality or number of serious / drama movies in theaters at all.  Hell, jump onto IMBD and looking at the number of Drama movies released in 2014 / 2015 and then compare that list to superhero / action movies.   In fact, here are a couple of highly rated drama movies I've pulled from my ass on a whim:   *  The Water Diviner   *  The Longest Ride   *  Child 44  *  The Imitation Game   *  Unbroken  *  Gone Girl   *  Whiplash   *  Woman in Gold   *  Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)  *  Inherent Vice  *  The Theory of Everything  *  Fury  *  Wild   *  The Wolf of Wall Street  *  Cake  *  The Grand Budapest Hotel  *  Still Alice   *  Boyhood  *  Foxcatcher   And here are the super hero movies from 2014 / 2015:  * Captain America: The Winter Soldier * The Amazing Spider-Man 2 * X-Men: Days of Future Past * Guardians of the Galaxy * Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles * Avengers: Age of Ultron * Ant-Man - NOT RELEASED * Fantastic Four - NOT RELEASED.  Thats it, now that hardly seems like a flooded market no does it.   So again, advertising makes the difference here. And seeing as you are not the target demographic for superhero movies of course it seems like all there is available at the theater is those movies.   but yeah again, you are wrong.

I doubt anyone will see this but it's worth a try.  I've been toying with the idea of organizing a "pop up cinema" around Melbourne. I'd like to organize a monthly or bi monthly event at different locations around Melbourne doing screenings of classic, new, cult, indie, B grade/bad films and of course Aussie/local films.   I'd love to do themed nights (Bad movie night etc.) and have people get involved by voting for what movies they'd want to see, the next theme, preferred location.   I already have most of the equipment required, other than venues and licencing...  I've briefly looked into the licencing, permits etc that would be required but haven't given it too much thought as I'm not sure if I could garner enough interest / enough of a following to make it worthwhile.  TL;DR  I'd like to see if there would be any interest in a pop up cinema around Melbourne with themed events that caters to movie lovers?   Ideas? Thoughts?   1982: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial Game.  Atari obtained the rights to make a game based on the ET movie, they paid one person to design and make the game, not only that, they only gave him about 5-6 weeks to do it in.  Their motivations were not to please the fans, or to create art, it was an opportunity to cash in on a popular franchise / brand recongition, it was an investment and they were looking for a quick turn around on that investment.  Nothing has changed since then, gaming has and always will be a business and as with all businesses the objective is profit, if you can make a good product, even better bu profit is the bottom line. Like it or not.   As a fellow Doug you are putting our name to shame...   Wrong!  Bananas are slightly radioactive because they contain potassium and potassium decays. Potassium is a necessary substance for healthy operation of your body. You would have to eat a LOT of bananas just to compete with the natural potassium dose of your body. But we're talking about genetically engineered Bananas here...   So they'll all get cancer from eating too many genetically engineered Bananas... Or they themselves will mutate and turn into a giant banana like cocoon that when ripe peels back to reveal a delicious human/banana hybrid... because life, uh, finds a way.

Thats nothing compared to BF: Hardline on the PS4 PSN...  $99 Standard edition - This is expensive for a glorified mod but ok, whatever.  $109 Deluxe Edition - Same as above, only they give you a few battlepacks, basically you are paying to to unlock in game content with real money... Which is stupid, but whatever, some people are ok with that I guess.  $179 Ultimate Edition - Thats right, they took a glorified mod of BF:4 by removing most of the weapons and vehicles, tacked on a shoddy story... Threw it into a "bundle" by "giving" you access to locked in game content through battlepacks or whatever they fuck they are called and then sell it at the low low price of $179...   Think about that for a moment, that's almost $200 for a single game, that is verging on half the price of the hardware to play the game on. Not to mention it's a throwaway game that will be forgotten in a couple more months...   Now we wait to see what they'll do with Starwars Battlefront and how many editions they'll throw down our throats with their DLCS and battlepacks and other cash grabs.  If this is the future of gaming then I'm out... Seriously... I'll stick to buying games one year or more after release when the "complete" edition comes out and is cheap. But again if they're multiplayer games then the community will be dead by that point as  they'll all have jumped ship onto the next big cash grab.  /rant    [You mean like this?](http://i.imgur.com/piOvpRs.gif)   Stay behind her, problem solved.

The answer to this is also in the article: Occupational Segregation  What causes the discrepancy in workplace deaths? The main cause is occupational segregation  the tendency for some jobs to be mostly held by men, and others to be mostly held by women. The most hazardous jobs  whether due to exposure to dangerous substances, or to risk of falling or being in a highway accident  are disproportionately held by men. (Contrary to popular belief, people in risky jobs are not usually paid extra to compensate them for danger).  Occupation segregation, in turn, is caused in part by workplace discrimination, both in the form of employers preferring a particular sex, and in the form of on-the-job harassment and discrimination making blue-collar women, or a pink collar men, know that theyre unwelcome.  Occupational segregation is also caused by self-segregation, as many male workers feel uncomfortable applying for female-dominated jobs, and vice versa. There is, in my opinion, a vicious cycle functioning; the lack of pink-collar male, and blue-collar female, role models and mentors makes it less likely that future workers will cross the occupational gender line.

          Oddly enough, Worstall reaffirms Piketty here: the postwar 1920s, 1950s and 1960s (two wars, remember) strongly appear to be anomalies that interrupted the normal trend towards concentration of wealth and slowing growth in richer countries. Nothing disrupts norms like "blowing stuff up".               "the Four Corners are in the San Juan Basin, the most productive basin for natural-gas production from coal in North America. Some 60,000 wells are at work there extracting methane from coal.   Just a coincidence, no doubt.   Quick thoughts...  Insulation and window retrofits are very effective in most areas, although not cheap. Electricity efficiency may or may not be the most effective way to reduce emissions, depending on where your local power comes from and what your costs are (if you can save high dollars while reducing emissions, approvals are much easier). Recycling is a biggie anywhere, saving about 6% of carbon emissions nationally. Encourage kids and staff to walk or bike to school, and push for safe routes to do so.    "Along with the sage grouse provision, the bill would legislatively delist wolves in the Great Lakes and Wyoming and would limit the government's ability to regulate ivory and the use of lead in ammunition and fishing tackle.  So pandering to a few miners and ranchers, plus rural duck hunters who want their lead shot and ivory-inlaid shotguns.             TL;DR: It's all about TV.  Even of the 10% going to "digital advertising"--the second-largest category after television--a large amount is simply fundraising appeals to build the TV ad budget. Same goes for "events".     "The measure provides $7.5 billion for the EPA, an estimated $717 million or 9 percent cut from its current appropriation."   http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/epa-budget-cuts-house-republicans-108670.html   FutureGen is not a company; this was the long, multi-billion-dollar US government attempt to make CCS economical. Similar attempts at CCS have failed in other countries.   Yeah, this is a baby step, but we can be sure it won't be the last step. The mere fact that they've agreed on the need to quit fossil fuels, with most of that by 2050, is quite a landmark, don't you think?    From here on, we can be sure of one thing: no one who matters will ignore or deny the climate mess as they have done. But CCS has been an unmitigated failure, and not for lack of trying. [FutureGen](http://www.statejournal.com/story/28085707/futuregen-20-a-unique-clean-coal-failure) has failed--twice--and has now been cancelled again. The brutal fact is that CCS was never anything more than a sop to coal-dependent states, most of which also happen to be important political swing states (KY, OH, VA, WV, TN, NC, CO, MT, NM). Burying cubic miles of CO2 at high pressure in hundreds of sites, without possibility of any leaks forever, is simply impractical. It's just much cheaper to switch to cleaner energy and better energy efficiency.   Global environmental agreements can also work well, as Montreal proved.            And how does one do that while continuing to burn fossil fuels? CCS shows no promise of ever becoming close to economical at scale.   http://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/WRI13-IPCCinfographic-FINAL_web.png   Some progress is better than none, and this is definitely not the last time we'll see world leaders stepping up their action on the climate mess. Stay tuned.   Not really. We already have four times more in known reserves than we can burn.   A false choice. SA can screw Iran, Russia and the US shale industry while also liquidating assets that will soon lose their value.                                    After everybody in the current G7 are dead. Convenient.  You do realize that it'll take a lifetime to phase out carbon fuels, right? I'm a fanatic about doing this, but even I realize that it requires several decades. The G7 leaders are talking about 70% emissions reductions by 2050, which is nothing short of impressive.   No. We actually have around four times more in present reserves than we can burn.                     Unfortunately, he will provide political cover to somewhat lesser whores to the fossil fuel industry such as Bush, Santorum and Cruz.         paywalled      Good points in other comments here, but don't lump "renewables" together if you want a good answer. Remember that the largest renewable energy source today is hydropower, which is definitely limited by the "extraction", so to speak, of a very finite number of suitable dam sites. Wind and biomass are also limited by available site constraints. Solar is not much limited by those, and will be even less limited as its efficiencies continue to improve.   Think again. The large majority of fossil fuel subsidies are [*consumption* subsidies](https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3QQGObK-7eJPpXn3R5RR2MzUvM=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3355188/Screen_Shot_2015-01-29_at_12.34.26_PM.0.png) - handouts to make oil, gas and coal cheap - and most are outside North America and Europe.  And those are just the direct taxpayer handouts. The *indirect* handouts to build fossil fueled infrastructure, to defend fossil fuel production regions and transport routes, and to deal with the health and environmental costs of pollution, are in the trillions per year. For example, [this recent analysis](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fossil-fuel-subsidies-cost-5-trillion-annually-and-worsen-pollution/?) quantifies only a portion of it, without considering the infrastructure and military costs. Roughly speaking, we spend 5-10% of the world economy to prop up the fossil fuel business.  That is the real cost of our addiction. The drug dealer analogy is a great one.   corporate tax incidence falls mostly on labor   Again, that sounds suspiciously close to dodging the issue, which, again, is the fact that *much or most* of corporate taxes fall on shareholders, so, even if 51% of the burden falls on labor--which it probably does not--any corporate tax cut still disproportionately benefits major owners of capital.  Is corporate tax incidence controversial and debatable? Of course. But there is little doubt that it would take a very progressive tax hike elsewhere to offset a major slash of corporate tax, preventing a shift of tax burdens from rich to middle and lower classes.     Well, it would be if drug dealers received $550 billion per year in taxpayer handouts, then spent some of that largesse on propaganda to convince us that drug addiction is beautiful and patriotic.    Less capital intensive firms have a higher labor incidence, even if you use the Harberger model.  Yet the trend is towards greater capital intensity, and has been since before Harberger.  We don't tax stock, we tax the income gained from holding stock.  We are discussing corporate income tax, which is an indirect tax on shareholder returns.  it would shift burden from low   middle income individuals to high income individuals.   Only if shareholders bear little or no part of the corporate tax burden, yet they bear much or most of it. Any tax cut for them is paid by someone farther down the food chain.    Most of the corporate tax incidence is already on non-supervisory labor.  For Walmart, yes. For Facebook, definitely not. The future will bring more companies like the latter. And there is no question (Harberger, etc.) that shareholders generally bear *much* of the corporate tax burden if not most of it.  The reduction in net distortionary costs is large enough that a fairly small increase in the top rate of income taxation would be sufficient   Except that the issue here is taxing wealth, not income. Shares are wealth. Substituting top-bracket personal income taxes for corporate taxes would simply shift burdens from the elite to the upper middle class.   Utrecht has a population of 331,000; Nantes has 283,000. That's not much larger than bike-friendly US cities like Madison, WI, with about 245,000.  In the States, the [most bike-friendly cities](http://guide.bicycling.com/ride-maps/featured-rides/2014-americas-best-bike-cities) tend to be larger university towns. Seems odd that none made the list.          Sure, but those systems began as means to create larger tax bases, not as ways to shift burdens from rich to poor. Very different, that.   True, which is why none of these companies are American. BTW, ALEC *is* the Kochs.   Perhaps, but beware the means to that end. Do you think the US, for example, would readily embrace a wealth tax, or large raises in cap gains or estate taxes, to replace the corporate income tax? If not, abandoning the corporate income tax would simply shift still more tax burdens onto the middle and lower classes. Try that and you'd quickly see just how fast a strong political left can rise in this country.             Nice answer. Interesting that you should mention Suncor, however, which is conspicuously absent in this group--along with all the US majors and the worldwide nationals.   We agree! Hysteria serves no purpose. However, healthy concern does, and that was what led to the successful cleanup of rivers, to the Clean Air Act, to the Montreal Protocol.   Now we have a far larger challenge before us, with much harsher penalties for inaction. Yet, as you may have noticed, a third of the population and half of our leaders insist that it is no problem at all. How do we motivate them without pointing to the dire consequences of this?    No, but the issue here is Federal subsidies and mandates, which only apply to US crops.   Encouraging palm oil is not an issue in the US, but oilseeds such as camelina are. They rotate well with other crops, especially dryland grains.      Okay, corn-based ethanol didn't work out and should be retired. However, biodiesel definitely does work, often without displacing food crops, and it accounts for nearly 20% of biofuel production. It's worth keeping that baby while tossing out the ethanol bathwater.            It's Rupert Murdoch's WSJ. I'm surprised they didn't add horns to Kerry's helmet.   Precisely why conservatives so often want to leave decisions to the states and counties. Lower-level representatives are more easily bribed. Media oversight is poor. The poor are more easily ignored.    Mark Lynas, is that really you? If so, thanks for "Six Degrees"!   Imagine the cost savings if America returned IRS funding to operable levels in order to catch more tax cheats.    What is more political than the distribution of money and rewards? If anything confuses me, it's economists insisting that this discipline exists in a plane far above politics.   Precisely. Reminds me of a Tea Party-infested town hall meeting I once endured in a moribund, small, Western city, where all proposed economic solutions came back to the way tax cuts would supposedly attract major businesses because land was already cheap (because no one wanted to live there). Meanwhile, no one seemed aware that the area's largest employers were the Federal and state governments.  Brownback-style grandstanding definitely serves the short-term interests of those who sit at the top of the tight local hierarchy. They may talk about bringing the world to Kansas, but they are really much more focused on keeping the world away, to remain the biggest fish in the pond.   Then again, God doesn't keep Inhofe in office. Oil money does.   "So, why are the Texas Three trying to cut funding to such a vital field?...they have chosen to punish the field that brought climate change to light and stifle future research in the discipline so they can sweep the study of the Earth under the rug (or just try to erase it from the record). They want to cast this as fiscal responsibility and prioritizing sciences but read it as it really is: political games that threaten the country and the planet.  Uh, they're from Texas, remember? They are bankrolled by the fossil fuel industry, which gives 85-90% of its political money to Repubs, with a bonus for *Texas* Repubs. They aren't playing games. To say they are whoring is an insult to whores, who don't endanger the lives of millions.   Time to face the fact that CCS was never anything more than a political boondoggle to keep U.S. coal states in the fold?  Ever notice that most coal-dependent states just happen to also be the most critical electoral swing states: Kentucky, Colorado, West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee, Montana, Ohio?   There's only one solution for this asshole: death by snowballs.   That's false equivalency. Cleaning up some rivers and smog decades ago doesn't reduce the urgency of the climate mess now. I'm optimistic that we'll solve this before catastrophe and warfare break out, but there's a significant and growing chance that we won't.       Jeb will *never* shake off that monkey on his back.    Considering that the world's largest industry consistently gives 85-90% of its U.S. political money to Republicans, we can easily replace "GOP" with "fossil fuels" in this headline.         Our Saudi friends are hogging all the suicide missions against us? It may take me some time to get my head around this.   ARGO data is both relatively new and decidedly sketchy, not only because the ARGO float fleet was smallish until recently, but also because the mechanics of the floats' measuring devices were imperfect. To further confuse the matter, some studies have lumped ARGO measurements together with the old bathymetric data that was even less reliable, demonstrably erring on the warm side. That created the likely false appearance of a flat or even cooling trend.  http://www.skepticalscience.com/cooling-oceans.htm   A RICO suit against the fossil fuel industry and its allies? Yeah, it'll probably come to that, and the bastards at Exxon, Koch, Chevron, Peabody et al have been fully aware of it for years. But this will make the Big Tobacco suit look like a picnic.   Leave it to the Globe And Mail to shill once more for the Canadian fossil fuels biz.   Chris Mooney nails it again. And what a chart!  Who knew that Jehovah's Witnesses, who almost totally reject evolution, are among the more supportive of environmental regulation?       Your family member is simply reading to buttress his motivated reasoning, cherry-picking whatever data supports his preconceptions. He is [very far off](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/global-warming-ocean-heat-18905) with his statements about lack of excess warming in the oceans.   However, you won't change his mind, because his objections are entirely political, not scientific. (First clue: rants about "warmists".) Would this family member be politically and/or religiously conservative, by any chance?       Another way to look at this is to ask what we are *not* investing in, and why. That's often a better question in that most stock investors hold a broad basket of stocks, so it's the missing pieces that are most telling.  For me, the largest missing chunks are:   Energy: all energy stocks are in for a long, rough ride as carbon regs loom and low-cost oil producers like the Saudis liquidate their assets while they can. That will continue for decades. Meanwhile, coal is a dead man walking, shale gas is coming under growing scrutiny for both methane leaks and groundwater pollution, and all energy sources--even renewables--are being whacked by the oil liquidators.    Banks: more regulation, higher reserve requirements, and a global abundance of capital with nowhere to go.   Tobacco: nasty business with little upside.                            I think you're on to the core issue: many of the world's young now identify as members of the global community at least as much as they identify as part of a given nation, tribe or religious sect. That's especially true in wealthier countries.  Chalk it up to globalization, pervasive electronic media, the spread of English, the advance of science, and the long worldwide outbreak of peace and prosperity.   Studies (Haidt, etc.) suggest they are acting more from fear and tribal loyalty. Cultural conservatives in many cultures tend to recoil from scary stimuli and violations of social norms. There is actually [strong evidence](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2011/09/07/your-brain-on-politics-the-cognitive-neuroscience-of-liberals-and-conservatives/#.VWinSGCkJG4) that this is linked to differences in brain structure itself.               Not much different from previous generations. Except that they had employer pensions to cover retirement.     "The study also notes an 'increasing acknowledgment that religion is not consistent with scientific understanding' could be driving adolescents away from religion."   Bingo. The author could have gone straight to this without all the bogus speculation about selfish social atomization.   And the time period studied is also more than a little suspect. The U.S. went through a major religious revival in the early 1950s, so using that as a starting point will show a decline in religiosity in *any* subsequent decade.         Renewables are already profitable. See: FirstSolar, Sunpower, Tesla, Vestas, etc.. Most of those stocks have outperformed Exxon over the past three years.  Exxon has repeatedly vowed to stay out of renewables because, unlike tobacco companies buying pot businesses, renewables do not *complement* oil and gas; they directly compete with it.   Yes. Basalt floods, large meteor impacts and Milankovitch cycles (the Earth's orbital cycles that drive ice ages). But we understand the latter very well, and our species hasn't been around long enough to experience either of the former two.   Is a Google search too difficult?   http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/indicators/weather-climate/heavy-precip.html   Notice that Goddard does not cite his graph's source. It completely contradicts those from [The National Climate Assessment](http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/heavy-downpours-increasing) and [NOAA](http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/indicators/weather-climate/heavy-precip.html). (That NOAA page was down so I linked an EPA page showing the NOAA data.)   Unsurprising. Despite no background in science, Goddard/Heller is a regular with fossil fuel front groups Heartland Institute and the Science   Public Policy Institute.   Yeah, and those renewables will eat *Exxon's* revenue stream, so Exxon works to keep them down.   We have met the enemy.   Bias? In ranked lists of city rainfall stats?             skepticalscience.com has most of what you seek.   It's Texas. They're clinging to the fossil fuels industry that defines the whole state and its sprawling, gas-guzzling ideal.   Of course, because the economy's size and complexity aren't increasing at all.   "This doesn't work. At the very least it destroys your EROEI, forcing you to extract more and lower EROEI carbon.   Hey, it sure works if you're an oil exec desperate for a climate solution that brings you still more subsidies.   Unfortunately, this is just a pivot from denying the climate problem to insisting that the best way to solve it is to spend an ungodly fortune burying fossil fuel exhaust, handing yet another massive taxpayer subsidy to oil and coal companies. The much, much cheaper solution is to outlaw fossil fuels, but that would also outlaw Shell, which, like nearly all other fossil fuel companies, has dropped any serious effort to develop competing energy sources because those would cannibalize their core business lines.   https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?cycle=2014 ind=E01  http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/blog-uploads/2012/11/list-countries-co2-per-capita.png      Yeah, but Repubs had more *room* to move to the extreme due to the unfair and increasingly antique extra voting power allowed to rural areas and sparsely populated states, which have become more conservative as the educated and secular young have moved to the cities.    Okay, it's 90% Republicans who are guilty of this. And the fossil fuel industry gives 90% of its political money to Republicans; what a coincidence.         Thanks, although I see that free-marketeer downvoters have already passed judgement on the headline alone. Figures.  The article does seem far-fetched, but I love the peacock tail analogy, and it's likely that competition will continue to dominate economics for that reason: the selfish desire to dominate rivals and attract higher-value sexual partners won't vanish from the human species anytime soon, and financial striving is the main proxy for both desires, so competition will always edge out cooperation until our descendants devise a way to better themselves (which they or their machine creations probably will, but not in my time).          broken link   "Okay, I admit that I'm trashing the climate, endangering millions of lives and heaping trillions in costs on your grandchildren, but you'll have to pay me plenty to stop."         *If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.*  Substitute "political party" for "State" in the above, and it appears that not much has changed since Goebbels' day.   Bingo. Republican Party leaders aren't *blinded by* echo chambers; they *use* echo chambers to keep the rank-and-file blind. The leadership is all too aware of how real the climate mess is, and what a threat solving it poses to their oil and coal industry sugar daddies. They simply play dumb while knowingly screwing the world's poor and vulnerable.   Well, you've partly answered your own question, in that you've identified temperature as something other than atmospheric CO2 that has a long trail of ancient evidence. Is your friend familiar with things like the fossil record?  As for temperature trends since the 1850s, the slope of the rise has been [steadily steepening](http://jennifermarohasy.com//wp-content/uploads/2009/06/hammer-graph-4-us-temps.jpg) (with some "noise" along the way). And temps now have likely exceeded the heights of the past 10,000 years, which is particularly striking because until now, the trend has been towards [steady but gentle *cooling*](http://www.skepticalscience.com//pics/Holocene_Temperature_Variations_Marcott_500.png) over the past 8,000 years.   Your friend is hugely ignorant of the facts on this one. There is abundant and reinforcing climate data that extends far beyond recorded history. Air bubbles trapped in 600,000-year old ice; fossilized coral growth rings and tree growth rings; fossils that reveal varying distributions of climate-sensitive species over many millions of years; ancient plant stomata; populations of benthic forams, etc..   In the US, gas taxes pay for less than half of road construction and maintenance. General fund taxes pay about the same share and taxpayer-funded bonds pay nearly all the rest.  The trucking industry is the real freeloader here. Trucks do more than 90% of road damage yet pay only 30% of fuel taxes and a much smaller share of other taxes.         Just another attack on cyclists by conservatives.  First, most road taxes are paid by general funds and bonds, not gas taxes, so drivers have *no* special right to the road.  Second, trucks account for more than 90% of road wear yet pay only 30% of fuel taxes, so *they* are the freeloaders here to the tune of $50-60 billion per year nationwide.  Third, cars and trucks contribute to the climate crisis while cyclists help solve it.   Etcetera. But logic has nothing to do with this finger to cyclists.     The difference: we need farmers.   Goodbye television? Uh, no.    "todays forests are going to be subject to continued increases in mortality rates that will result in substantial reorganization of their structure and carbon storage.  Translation: another warming feedback.   [Already happening.](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2015/01/150120-thermos-like-passive-homes-heat-up-in-the-us/)         Among other things, staying within 1.5C is possible only if rich countries will pay poor countries to do it. And why shouldn't we? We, our parents and grandparents caused most of this problem, and we each still pollute at many times the rate of the world's poor. Yet we cannot even meet our promises to fund the measly $100 billion Green Climate Fund, which is the only substantial step taken to date.      http://citizensclimatelobby.org  http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/   Not really. The difference between fossil fuel pollution costs and externalities from other industries is that the former have been extensively studied and quantified. This IMF paper simply draws upon those many refereed foundations.          Unfortunately, I doubt that polite appeals will move rich countries to keep their promises.    [Related article.](http://www.rtcc.org/2015/05/21/green-climate-fund-says-its-funded-and-open-for-business/)         "Technically possible" but politically impossible until the rich world takes the [Green Climate Fund](http://www.rtcc.org/2015/05/21/green-climate-fund-says-its-funded-and-open-for-business/) more seriously.   So progressive college towns are more bike-friendly than big cities. Count me unshocked.  Interesting to see Minneapolis as the only real city on the list, however.    He says that 97% of publishing climate scientists don't know what they're talking about, and then he accuses *them* of intellectual arrogance?   Only from a Bush.   Wrist-slap fines, and no one has gone to jail.   "Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that human activity has led to climate change. Ninety-seven percent. But Jeb Bush thinks they're wrong. Who's being intellectually arrogant now?" said Holly Shulman, DNC spokeswoman.            "Hypothetical costs"?    I admit that including traffic accidents seems a stretch, but that's a very small share of the total cost, and the rest is quite well documented.   True enough, but I doubt that changing the source of taxes would influence the sprawl problem one way or the other. However, paying from general funds *would* eliminate one of our most regressive taxes, and it would also kill the bad but pervasive argument that bicycles have no right to the roads because they pay no gas tax.            http://www.energypost.eu/historic-moment-saudi-arabia-sees-end-oil-age-coming-opens-valves-carbon-bubble/   That, and the unpalatable fact that smolders at the heart of the disconnect between rich and poor countries...  ...namely, that we richies put nearly all of the excess CO2 into the air, profited from it, and each of us still pollutes at 4-20 times the rate of those in developing countries, so people in those poor countries will continue to pollute until we pay them not to. And try selling *that* to your Tea Party neighbors.   Oil prices likely won't recover. Low-cost oil nations are dumping their product while they can, before carbon pollution regs kick in. SA alone has decades of production left in major fields like Ghawar, meaning that they'll keep pumping until the world says they can't.   "Warning shots". Good one. On the same night of August 2, the US launched: 1) a commando landing in North Vietnam, which resulted in a firefight; 2) a CIA bombing raid on North Vietnam; and, 3) a US ship incursion far into North Vietnamese territorial waters, firing on North Vietnamese boats when challenged.    How about we just pay for roads the way most countries do, through general funds, or triple taxes on the trucking companies that cause more than 90% of road damage while paying only 30% of fuel taxes?   Vietnam has not "admitted they initiated the attack on the Maddox" on August 2, and there remains abundant dispute on this point.  US Defense Secretary McNamara himself later admitted that the second "attack", on August 4, never happened.  However, there is no dispute that North Vietnam claimed a 12 mile territorial limit, in line with South Vietnam's claim, the former French claim (20km) and the claims of most nations at the time, including the United States. Yet the Maddox was ordered to within *four miles* of the North Vietnamese coast on August 2, and may have gone closer still. And this was at the same approximate time as a botched US commando landing on North Vietnam's coast *and* CIA bombing of eastern North Vietnam, from bases in Thailand. All that is "legal monitoring"? No, it is not. These are acts of war, they were all conducted in concert and in secret, and the result was a giant lie and millions dead. George Ball also admitted as much. Face it: the only justification for the Vietnam War was the U.S. desire to swing a big dick, which failed miserably. You'd think we'd have learned something from that.   "It's estimated that a further increase in sea level of one foot - just one foot - by the end of this century could cost our nation $200 billion," Obama will say.  Unfortunately, the consensus estimate for sea level rise this century is at least double that, with a strong possibility of being much higher still, and the financial damages of higher levels are exponential, not linear. And let's not forget that the last time the Earth had 400 ppm CO2, as it now does thanks to us, sea levels rose to around *65 feet* higher than today.   More like provocation, sailing into Vietnamese territorial waters and back out again to draw fire. There is *no* evidence that the Vietnamese attacked first.   Sure, that was worth [millions dead](http://thevietnamwar.info/how-many-people-died-in-the-vietnam-war/) and an indelible stain on American honor.    Um both are distorting markets though.  Yeah, but, as the article says, renewable energy subsidies distort markets in order to *solve* a gigantic global problem while fossil fuel subsidies distort markets while making that problem worse. Bit of a difference there, but one should never let facts disrupt a good false equivalency.   They might. But in this hypothetical, Myanmar is a strong military dictatorship, so its neighbors might decide a few dying forests aren't worth a war. And most of the countries impacted by its climate engineering are at a considerable distance.   It's a Weitzman paper on how to control the "free driver" problem, which is explained a little more [here](https://books.google.com/books?id=2KIpBQAAQBAJ pg=PA39 lpg=PA39 dq=weitzman+free+driver source=bl ots=Gksyfg77Wy sig=UaOUXbzsCn7c9T_j3oouCPC4CME hl=en sa=X ei=Aq9cVYfTJ8ODsAX_u4CICQ ved=0CFEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage q=weitzman%20free%20driver f=false).   http://scholar.harvard.edu/weitzman/publications/voting-architecture-governance-free-driver-externalities-application            C'mon and grow a pair, Economist. It's not *energy* subsidies that are cooking the climate while distorting markets, it's *fossil fuel* subsidies.  Still, OP, thanks for posting this.   Perhaps brother George's rush to invade Iraq *was* due to faulty intelligence: his.  	200
 Here are two older instruments that are kinda similar:  The Foto Player: http://youtu.be/U0JZszqC7mk  (featuring the ever-excitable Huell Howser!)  Hupfeld Phonoliszt Violina: http://youtu.be/oQMhFJ14hik    This is the beginning of a six month trip I'm taking across SE Asia. I wanted to start in Hanoi, spend some time in the north, then head into Laos and travel the Mekong river (roughly) and end up in HCMC by the end of September.   I was supposed to start in June, but life kinda got in the way so I had to push it to September. I know it's not an ideal time to go, but is it bad enough that I should spend September somewhere else?  Thanks a ton to anybody that responds; I haven't had as much time to plan as I was hoping, so I get the feeling I'll be asking you guys a lot of questions in the next month!   Helmet's fine, I bailed at just the right time. Half a second later and I'd have been in the same tree!  Watched a little of the gopro footage, my face when I realized it was still rolling is priceless!   Couple of bruises, nothing bad. The Gopro footage is crazy! I'd post the video, but I'm still on the road with no computer  	4
 Congrats man, it's really great work. Can't wait for The White Donkey!   Speaking just from my experiences, I definitely felt that way during my first time in China. Most of the people I've talked to who lived in China were students who studied there for a semester (like me) or maybe a year, or English teachers who were there for a short period of time. Since most know going into it that it's just temporary, it doesn't really feel like the "real world" of work or putting down roots.   In my case I (along with 20 others from my school) were only there a semester. Classes were a joke, everything was super cheap (early 2000's), and we had tons of free time. So I had half a year of no real responsibilities or expectations, which definitely made it seem unreal.    I'm meeting with an ANG recruiter later this week but wanted to get your opinions on 2 things: 1. Joining enlisted vs officer? I've heard varying opinions on pros/cons for both. I've got a masters in public policy fwiw.  2. If I do go the officer route (which is super hard to get into I know) would I go through OCS/AMS and then a tech school? Or is there a different way that officers obtain the specialized knowledge for their field?    Sweet, I think I'll wear this to BMT and point it out to the instructors to let them know how hardcore I am...   Ha, glad to see so many other Persona fans here.   Ha when I was a kid my dad had a book about being in the military and it said something like "the military provides a soldier with everything they need...food, shelter, clothing, etc." So I just assumed there would be some huge warehouse of clothes and supplies and you could just stop by and take whatever you needed when it wore out....   How was the food?   Tbilisi is great. Lots of cool little shops and places to explore. There's an old castle and trails to explore which was fun. The food is by far the best part. Khachapuri (cheesy bread) and Khinkali (meat-filled dumplings) were my favorites.      I love the red stars on their helmets too...great attention to detail!   Sounds like a hell of a guy.    Wow that's a good point, I didn't think of it that way.       What did you have for dinner?   Probably all the cool flavors of packaged food. Shrimp chips, honey toothpaste, spicy hot pot Lays potato chips...  Now that I'm back in the States I still swing by the Asian grocery store to pick some up.    Oh awesome, it's getting ready to shoot!....oh, I guess not :-/   I love that the US Coast Guard started [using the racing stripe in the 1960's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard#Service_Mark_.28.22Racing_Stripe.22.29) and it just became a thing for coast guards worldwide.    Time to buy that flamethrower I guess...      Young kids. Like Hope from FFXIII or Eiko from IX. They really just annoy me and I feel like they take away from the story.    Well they just defaulted on their debt in July, the second time in less than 13 years. Several agencies have also stopped accepted Argentina's official statistics on the economy since they are pretty clearly falsified.    How funny, I'm in the middle of that book right now! On page 261 he says:  "I tear at my body armor and get it opened. With my right hand on the the sleeve that holds my five-pound front armor plate, I grab the insurgent's hair and ram his head forward, jamming his chin into his chest. He's pinned in place now. All I have to do is finish him.  I beat him with the inside of my armor plate. I smash it against his face again and again and again until blood flows all over the inside of my shirt. He kicks and flails and screams. Every scream gets cut off by another blow from the plate..."   "Alright, we need to take this hill....OMAHA! OMAHA!"   Yeah I'm pretty sure that's what it is...right?   Woo Minnesota!    Tell him the original soundtrack to AOE1 is amazing! I wish I could find it somewhere, my old computer is long dead.    Wow as if I didn't already feel like a lazy sack for doing nothing this weekend...kudos to your dad on keeping up with it like that. Good motivation for me to get my ass to the gym.   Ha that's pretty awesome   Damn Libya, share the wealth...   Detroit's airport actually has a [cool tunnel too.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/LightTunnelDetroit.jpg)  [Another shot](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-o84M9A9SFnc/TxCUsPqtewI/AAAAAAAABOU/_Vx7ZlTb4g0/s1600/IMG_0132.jpg)   It's also [Armistice Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_Day) which was the end of WWI so many countries in Europe and others who fought in it, like New Zealand, celebrate it.       God that would be awesome to have....   I have the Skyrim station and an overall "Videogame music" station that I use.    That's really badass.   Anything to calm tensions is good for the populations of both countries.       I don't think so, largely because of the USSR. Stalingrad was in 1942-1943 and the Nazis were retreating from the East following that. The Soviets did get a lot of help and goods from the U.S. Lend-Lease so that might have taken a hit if Germany's navy was improved, but the Russians would still been able to supply most of their troops without it.  Still, I think the Nazi's would have eventually been beaten, or at least forced into a stalemate, it just would have been more drawn out and bloody.      Man that "slow motion" part at the end is just crazy   What was the hardest part?   Agreed. Like we use Starbucks packets of grounds in our office, but we get them from an office supply vendor who handles concessions for our whole building.    The [USS Torsk](http://www.historicships.org/torsk.html) is in Baltimore. I just did the tour last week.   Exactly and that was after he got a waiver for past drug usage AND an age waiver that allowed him to join at 42! Must have had good letters of recommendation...   That's badass   I can see that. There was an article (that I can't seem to find now...) about drone pilots who were having a hard time with killing targets. When they interviewed them they said that sometimes a drone could be assigned to monitor a house for days or weeks, and the pilots would see their whole family life, when dinner was each day, when the kids played in the front yard, etc. And then one day they would just get the order to fire on one of the people who was confirmed to be a terrorist. Takes a psychological toll, even from a thousand miles away.    The content of the article is one thing, but it needs an editor badly. Font size changes, unfinished sentences, misspelled words...it was hard to focus on what it was actually saying.    That's a good point...I was just wondering about the kind of people they accept. Like if they only pick a few and they are all prior-service and security cleared, than maybe I should work on building up my qualifications a bit first.   From looking around online, the only people I could find that were accepted into the program were Jeb Bush's son, Joe Biden's son, and the Mayor of LA...   Nice! Now I can't get that theme out of my head...   I was wondering if anyone on here had any experience with the DCO reserve programs? I know these spots are tough to get (although it seems like a lot of politically connected people got them...) but I'd love to give it a shot.  I'm non-prior, masters degree, and 10 years in research analysis and project management. My recruiter said being non-prior was probably my biggest detriment.... I was just wondering if I should go through the long application process to give it a shot, or if would be better to enlist and work my way from there?   I was wondering how others who joined the reserves handled the time off with their civilian jobs? My work is client-based so even though I'm protected from my company firing me, my clients could choose to leave...  Just wondering if anyone had any tips or advance. How was reintegrating after training/being deployed?    Haha my first thought too   Love the trigger on the briefcase handle.   I remember when the were having the debate about the the new Offshore Patrol Cutter a few years ago, some people said there were considering a design with an [X-bow hull](http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2013/April/Pages/NewCoastGuardCutterSparksFierceCompetitionAmongShipbuilders.aspx) that looked pretty far out...     Helpful to know, thank you!    What is the little white square on the display that moves around?   Totally agree with you guys. I'm constantly stressed out at work because of people and events that are totally beyond my control. I'd love to just say "Oh well, out of my hands" but I still feel stressed/responsible all the time...   That's actually super interesting, thanks for posting.    I always thought Yatagarasu (the three legged crow) was pretty awesome looking.   Poor bastard...he's probably done it 1000 times in practice and the one time he fucks up it has to be in front of the Commandant.    Looks like a pain in the ass to set up.   We didn't start the fire...   They were in Baltimore just a few weeks ago and I'm surprised there weren't more car accidents. Everyone just slammed on the brakes and was rubbernecking out their windows to see them flying overhead. But as a pedestrian it was awesome to see.    I'm prepping to get a grad degree and Calculus is a prerequisite for most of the programs I'm looking at...   I've used Courser and Khan Academy to build up my knowledge, but it would be great to find an online course that I could get credit for to satisfy the prerequisite. Anyone have any suggestions or good experiences with a specific program?    Combining my two loves: Mexican food and french fries ..   Thanks!! I've been unplugging my second monitor like an idiot every time I want to PrtScr my main window up till now.    Some of the A-10's being used against ISIS seem to have the shark faces like [these.](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-01/a-10-warthogs-final-fight-off-to-war-against-islamic-state)   Wow super cute!

Some places can make you a copy for a fee:  [http://corporate.discovery.com/contact/viewer-relations/ ](http://corporate.discovery.com/contact/viewer-relations/)  Or you could go on YouTube and try contact people who have old Discovery videos and see if they would know.

 Thanks   Thanks haha   [Monstercat Visualizer](http://marcopixel.deviantart.com/art/Monstercat-Visualizer-for-Rainmeter-1-2-1-486330771)  [TextTime](http://rainmeterhub.com/skins/textime-1-01/)  I can put up a skin theme when I return from school  Basically I set up eight visualizers. Mapped the frequency ranges. And colored them. Also edited the smoothening variables.    Yeah figured that out , the high end frequency on each visualizer is in changeable though:(   Time=TWELVEFOURTY   stayed up till #time# making this   I know haha it was a joke LOL. 1998 here, poor af family, grew up using these things.  Woah there didn't notice the visualizer-bar thing...good eye.  Thanks! :D   I might be a little addicted to changing my desktop...      OMG I'm Austrian too, VIE, you made the monstercat visualizer I'm living on that!!   didn't know this was you, your work is dope.   please enlighten me, how did stop monstercat from smoothening??          You're good mate ie is great. No joke   Music correct! Rap not really more like progressive rap(edm typish rap)  	16
 just shooting in the dark here, you a psych major?   He deleted it! What was it?                  I was young, silly and had some problems. I couldn't stand to hear more than 10 minutes of a Beethoven symphony and would just want to run outside the concert hall. I think it might have been because of my youthful impatience and naivety. I did however, one day stumble across my grandfather's huge collection of classical music and played  some Schubert on the record player which made me feel emotions I never knew existed in me. Needless to say, after that moment my entire perspective was changed.   Love how "The Nation" implies we're all American.    Assuming the camera was super advanced and could take clear images of our streets even.      I'm assuming that if it could, the minute would be different than here on Earth. Thus are we viewing history?   I found a dusty collection of Karajan conducting the 4th on my grandfather's shelf and am going to play the recoding tonight. :)   Thank you soo much for your detailed post! I've just heard the piano quartet and the third Symphony that you suggested and it is absolutely remarkable! Your comments on him really opened my mind to his music and i'm currently trying to appreciate him more. Thank you once again.  Schumann really is a unique gem!   I'm currently listening to his "Gesnge der Frhe" and it is to say the least, intriguing.    I know! The final passages of the third movement just strike home for me!    As someone who hated classical music with a passion a long time ago, learning to appreciate it made me realise that it is the things that we find boring and incomprehensible that often holds remarkable beauty and wonder. To extend on that, I once hated Mozart and Bach but over the years have come to love them! With Schumann, I feel the same and simply wish to love and understand him more.   He's just... incomprehensible to me. The way he writes his music and structures it is just.. foreign...  I think this work really sums up what I mean. It's gorgeous! But at the same time, I don't understand anything!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcmO4AKmeDc   Hello everyone! I'm currently a student studying Geomatics Engineering (accredited) with geology and CS on the side as minors and am worried about my career options. Most posts i've read here say that GIS is mainly a desk job, no field work, etc. and quite a few posts expressed disdain in their jobs. While I still enjoy doing GIS related projects in class, if all else fails, do I have any other options?  Just for clarification, some things covered in education include:  - Engineering Computation (Basically programming with Matlab) - Engineering math, calculus I,II,III, linear algebra - Engineering risk analysis - Database Systems (Programming with SQL) - Python, C++ and Java - GIS, GIS and more GIS - Some remote sensing  - A handful of geology courses   I apologise for any inconvenience I may cause but thank you in advance for offering your insight!   As a student who's doing a GIS focused degree (Geomatics Engineering) with geology and CS on the side, i'm worried..   Update please   I've been listening to him my whole life and have played a few of his works including his Kinderzsenen, Kriesleriana, Piano Sonata no.1 and Symphonic Etudes. However, I cannot for love of god appreciate and love him as much as I do for other composers like Schubert, Liszt, Beethoven, etc.  Any advice? He's an amazing composer that I know but what am I missing here?   It's basically a field that focuses on spatial analysis and visualisation and uses stuff from GIS to remote sensing.   I'm gonna do an engineering degree with a fair bit of CAD, ArcGIS and programming work like Matlab. I'm also an avid gamer and would love to be able to play demanding games like Deus Ex Human Revolution, Far Cry 4, GTA 5, maybe even Fallout 4 when the time comes? Just wondering whether the specs of this laptop would fit the bill. Thank you for your time!   - 15.6-inch 10-point touchscreen IPS 4K UHD display - Core i7 processor and NVIDIA GTX 960M - ZENBOOK aluminum uni-body design - 512GB PCIe x4 SSD and Thunderbolt connectivity - Premium sound design with Bang   Olufsen ICEpower   Oh! It was on my flair! It's called Geomatics/Spatial Engineering!   I mean my engineering course isn't really the standard like EE, CE, SE, etc. and while I do graduate with a few engineering accreditations, is my field really an "engineering engineering" field?  	25
 Lawrence of Arabia number 118?  How can you look me in the eyes and honestly say that Hot Fuzz is more favored then Lawrence of FUCKING Arabia      A Clockwork Orange (1971), Stanley Kubrick   A clockwork orange has three very different acts and I think they all work pretty well in the grand scheme of the film.  	4
 Today I'm going oem, but as soon as I have a few extra bucks I'm buying the piece listed above   Thank you so much, just bought a replacement plastic one since I'm in a pinch.  Will probably buy this one soon.  This is exactly what I'm looking for.   Yes Sir   06, 6 cylinder   3 piece plastic park pressed together.  The original lasted me 90k miles, now I'm replacing it due to total failure once a year it seems.  Can anyone suggest a quality part to replace it with?      Sounds about right, I knew ours was a couple.   The machine?  No, but I can ask.  I can however twach you how to you is.  It's rediculously simple.  I hadn't even thought of using it for homebrew.  Genius.   Meh.  Imperial Sweet stout made at 7.8% by an awesome brewery..... No fucks given.   Negative. S2E15 We met both of Lois' parents played by Cloris Leachman and Robert Loggia.   Or do I keep missing something?  The first episode I notice it being mentioned is the Christmas episode of season 3 in which Francis spends Christmas with Grandma.   Very true on the "Get what you pay for" stance.  I planned on going Paugcho with a 21' up front.  Please let me know of all the misc shit that comes up during your build.  Much love to an HD brother.      Let me know how the switch goes.  I'm saving up for a Softail standard (or custom) and want to make the springer switch.  Like most project I know there's going to be a lot of odds and ends that pop up while working on the project.  Keep us posted.   It's solid, I can dig it.  I do like the black and chrome contrast.  I saw you said you were going to go all black and those were expiremental pieces, but I like it as it.   What all do you have left to do   May be the best title in this sub.  Well played   See.. /u/Sheiko19 gets the humor of driving in Dallas traffc   So does that mean we can drive 85 now?         Upvote for title   Yeah, but I had a guy who was a reg at the dealership I used to work for (HD of Dallas in Allen TX) who could do it on a stock drive train with a 96' with a six speed.  No bored out jugs, no top end kit, no new cams.   Or, you know, when you shoot the springs out the top of you for tubes.   So I know this is the worst thing you can do to the front end of your bike.  Harley' are not made for wheelies.  But I still really want to know how on a bagger.   Be upfront and honest before hand.  Do what's natural.  Don't over think anything.  Sometimes don't think at all.  Have fun.  Be respectful.  Don't hurt yourself or anyone else. That's what I got for ya.   I have had ladies thank me after getting them off.  I thought it was cool.  Made felt like I did a good job and knew what I was doing.   1) have fun, don't be drunk, don't over think it.  2) high fives for the metaphore, just be upfront honest and direct  3) it last as long as it lasts  4) no clue, I have a penis   Different from woman to woman, that's one of the great things about them.  The one thing I would share.  Is if they feel rock hard or don't spread out or sink into herself when she lays on her back, they are fake.  Rock hard boobs are not always the case with breast auentation, but it's a sign of bad ones.   Well, it comes down to a few things.  The over all size of the guy and gal really.  If he's a very large guy and she's a very petite woman, vaginal death grip can occurr.  If he's small and she's a bit of a naturally larger woman in the lady parts area, he may not feel much.  But if both kind of mesh up in body type and size it can be tough to maintain stamina.    You are right though, frequency or masturbating and style of grip can affect things.  It could also be the amount of time a guy has been masturbating with out having sex that could cause him to not be able to climax, with a virgin or not.  You just get used to how our own hand feels any thing else may be tough to get to finish with.   Agreed, and I hope they do.  I'd love to roll on a new street glide one day.  Have the ad ons planned out in my head and everything.  Just wish they had just stuck with the cable system.   Agreed.  A 110' engine with a six speed transmission is A LOT of power.  My old man has an 07 Ultra with a 96' and a six speed transmission.  As heavy as it is, that thing still flys.  If you put another 14 cubic inches of displacement on a lighter bike you'll be able to outrun most of your friends on older bikes.  If you throw a 120r on it, you'll be excited for a while, and dissapointed later on for a long time.  EDIT:  Don't be afraid to look into a used or older Street Glide.  The touring models over the last few years (3 I think) have had quite a few recalls.  They've switched over to hydrolic clutches and electronic throttles.  They've been running into a lot of failure problems.  Ive had two different bikes, one am 07 street bob, I've never had a problem with the cable throttle and clutch.   I never felt that Theo Rossi' acting tanked.  Charlie Hunnam's accent from time to time......   I wouldn't assign hate to Jax, I just see at as a total downfall.  For me it's more interesting just seeing how he's fallen apart without assigning emotion to it.   I'm hoping I'm just stating the obvious and you already made the connection, but it's a reference to the reaper.  And it being on the end of a M16 references the clubs roots being that of Vietnam War Vets   It's l I keep a game of Snake when you eat your own tail, but with cum   Meh.... things are coming back around   So the next question is do you take off the excess skin when you are 50lbs away from GW or wait until you hit the GW and be even lighter after the procedure?    Got it, upside to belts on HD's, graraunteed for life and almost no maintanenece.  Downside, loss of power.  That's all I really have.   Not cleaning and oiling a chain every 500 miles is nice   Too lazy to read everything (ironic In this sub I know)  But if you elect to get surgery to remove all you excess skin once you reach your GW.  How many pounds of skin do you think they'll remove?   This may be the most helpful post on reddit ever.  Good job sir!   I like that handlebar set up a lot more with the taller risers, good pick!   Yeah, I've heard.  And riding next them they sounded horrible.  Lots of creeks and squeeks.  One of the guys I rode out of Arlington TX with, his primary wasn't even properly aligned and he had no idea.  Couldn't figure out why it was so loud and squeeky  (more so than a normal 3 inch BDL, I'm aware they can be loud and slap a little)  He was another guy who loved bikes, had a ton of cash, but no actual working knowledge.  No judgement to the guy, but it's a bummer to see someone drop so much cash on something that wasn't built with any respect or love.  Even though the guy spent his $ at his own ignorance.   Are you asking more, "Why do some models have belt drives on the left and some on the right?"   Met and rode with 2 different guys who bought and rode OCC when they first hit their hight of popularity around '02 or '03.  Both said it was the worst $80k they've ever spent.  I thought of a lot of things I felt were wrong with that statement.   I love MDK, didn't know this was still a thing.   It's possible.  I thought the same.  The only reason a small bit of me was doubting it was a bot was the profile had 4 or 5 pics of the same woman, none of them professionally taken.  Most were solo pics, no selfies, only 1 or 2 with friends.  But fishy was the first thing I thought.  Also possible that it was a real person and just drunk late on a friday.  All of this started going on around 1am my time.   So I was about 80% certain this was a bot or someone messing with me.  The fact that a 25yo woman couldn't even spell masturbating right was was a pretty strong give away.  Not worth wasting time on.   She's an angler apparently   Yeah, thought did cross my mind.  I was about 80% sure it was a bot or someone messing with me, wasn't really going to waste time on it.   Jugs   I am a male, female sent me that message   That was actually the first thing I noticed, don't think it bothered me as much as it did you though   "All of them babe, you're so fucking sexy"   Also, apparently I don't know the difference between to and too...      John Wayne Gacy, American Serial killer, in the 70's I believe.  He targeted teenage boys, 3 of which were buried in the crawl space under his house.  For secondary income he would dress and perform as a clown at children's parties.  The clown character, which he named, "Pogo the Clown" was considered to be Gacy's second persona or alter ego.   Saving Private Ryan   Umm... The Interview?  The only "The Interview" listed on netflix in the US is the Seth Rogan film.  Please tell me you were referencing something else.   Man, what I wouldn't give to fluff her sleeves   This is correct   Over all its better for your body to take in nutrients through out the day.  Your body will get rid of whatever it doesn't need at a certain time.  Similar to water, a lot of people say you need to dri m 8, 8oz glasses of water a day.  It does your body no good to drink 64 oz. All at once, once a day.      And they cost 10 cents a piece, and we couldn't stop people from sending them to use racking up our bill!   Well played sir, well played   Rawr   It's one of our many graced   Probably just to say he was there.  I don't get it either.  I really wish The MLB office would actually enforce the 12 second pitch rule, I think more people would be in the stands if it moved faster.  Looks like this lady was just trying to get to her seat.  But yeah.... The fans need to be more active and support their teams.   /r/trampolines is pretty fun   Most exciting seats ever.  MLB wants to make the game more interesting I say drip all the nets   Why did the retard cross the street?  Cuz Nate fired him. (We fired an unpaid intern [he was actually that bad]  The next morning we found out he had heavy learning disabilities we didn't know about.  We thought he was just am immature ass hole)   Former employee here.  There was an incredibly generous side to him.  I had both seen and experienced first hand.  There was the dark side though.  I'm surprised the article didn't mention the sexual harassment lawsuit of 2010 and hardly mentioned the pending lawsuit coming this summer.  After certain interactions with him, I came to realize a lawsuit was one of his greatest fears (I still don't know why specifically)  What really dissapointed me I'd he really didn't know limitations and was master of reinvention.  If he had lost this lawsuit, I'd bet he'd be the person that could lay low for a while and rebuild a new empire later.      One of the many, Many benefits of having a beard is avoiding these situations.  I highly recommend growing one   If you want to spend A LOT of time working on it and A LOT of money in machine shops to get proper parts made go for it, go for it.  I know this is absolute heresy in this sub, and I may be casted to HD Down vote hell, but a mid 70's Honda CB750 may be a better project bike if that's the style and era you're going for.   That may be the most honest and real thing I've seen on reddit.     Wow, I really wish the original comment wasn't deleted.  Out of context this is amazing    Charitable and generous givers   I'd like to see a statistic in relation to divorce rate and couples who had stripper bachelor/ette parties that went to far.   Not exactly.  We (The United States) currently provide South Korea with armed forces to secure it's boarder against North Korea.  We are not in In a state of physical conflict with North Korea, just guarding its southern boarder.  Think of it this way.  You're a parent and your child gets beat up on the way home from school daily by a kid twice his age and size.  You'd like to teach your child to stand up for himself, but the bully is far bigger and a fight would result in a bigger beating for your child.  Instead, you just walk your kid home yourself, to deter the bully from starting anything.    Poor Richard's in Plano at Avenue K and Park   Wow, 3 whole people on the internet don't like the fact you don't like duck dinasty   It's what cream dreams are made of   How about, "Cass Blumpkin"?   Oooo!  "Citizen Dick Bag"   Amen   I feel the same way.  There's a lot of people coming to the family which is great, but seeing the same 883, 48's time and again doesn't do it for me like seeing the classics.  There is so much beauty in the classics that people put time, work, and heart into.   Did not know, thank you   You're not crazy, that theory is pretty popular (Brook's mother) my favorite fan theory is that the homeless woman is the Angel of Death.  Every time she appears it is right before  (and in one case right after) a major death, even appearing in Ireland.  She still may be the ghost of Brook's mother, maybe both.   It might be, the bridge kind of leans that way, the rest of the track kind of goes back to his more ambiguous style of writing.   Just like rain on your wedding day isn't Ironic, it's just tragic   Horse s**t.  It's about the consumerism and over consumption of bottled water destroys development in third world countries.   Most his are.  He gets pretty inventive in creating imagery with his lyrics.  But some of his songs seem fairly direct in his writing.  Be aggressive is about rough, forced oral sex and Flash Back (Tomahawk) is about child molestation.   Just make sure you use a solid bushing in your risers and you'll be good to go   Very cool   Yes   I was 16 when I saw it, 15 years ago   Keep it up!   You really need to repost this to /r/MURICA The fireworks and zebra cakes made my day   A friend showed me this picture on an old site called www.phun.org, thought it was funny, kept looking around, not really that "wtf"      Keep it going! Stay commited, stay strong, stay patient      Just repost post it, that's the easiest imo.  When you put up a title just make sure to put "x/post funny" somewhere.  Some redditors are dicks about calling out people who dont   Ohnplease, please x/post this to r/creepy   Inbred...  Ftfy   Any time   The picture alone is a good candidate for /r/creepy    As they say in Vermont, Gracias   Am I still the only one who is dissapointed the article doesn't even say what the motto is?  Still waiting in suspense   Huh, weird.  I always thought from the bottom of my knee to the top of my ankle   I think I can hear my bangs growing   Wish I could upvote this several times      Agreed, the guy's an arrogant drunk.  No matter what this situation is of a Dallas sports team, his comments are always patronizing or condescending.   As far as his public opinions, all he's doing is taking the popular high road.  None of his thoughts are ground breaking.  I agree with him most of the time, but he's such an ass I hate to admit it.  	113

I don't know the laws, if any, that exist for this scenario, but I would assume patient privacy laws of some sort would be be on my side.   You see how monolithic, slow, burdensome and unresponsive our federal government is. How in the hell could you possibly think that letting some jokers run the whole world would be anything but an abysmal failure?  As much as I like the idea of a completely free world where everyone has constitutional rights, I dont trust the government to keep their promise. Its great in concept but in reality, I think if it were attempted to be applied, we would get a much different point of view that turns out to not be such a good thing. I dont think the guys that wrote our Constitution had that much faith in government either, which is why a lot of the things in the Constitution were written specifically to limit the role and the amount of power that the govt had.  1.) It would inevitably become perverted, corrupt, and totalitarian, no matter how it started out.  2.) It's much better to have a variety of government policies for the diverse cultures of the world than one single set that everyone shares.  3.) If a one world government was in place, it's not for the benefit of humanity. The elite, those above the government, these people you never see...presidents and other politicians are controlled by them. They only have their own benefit in mind. All they want from us are the power of our thoughts, our money and fruits of our labors, controlled and manipulated through media, entertainment, military and education.   Depends, did I look good?   Only the hired militants and sociopaths will turn their guns on fellow citizens.  I don't for one second believe the majority of police officers or military personnel would turn on our country or our neighbors.   Until something personally affects the daily life of the average citizen, they don't pay it much mind.  They don't get all worked up over things they read on the internet or the game-of-the-week played out by govt. politicians.  People can see the patterns, see the direction we're headed in.  But until it touches them, it's just not relatable.   Perhaps you generalize 'Us Americans' too broadly.   A declaration of martial law would change things drastically.  There are far more people opposed to the very concept of this than you can imagine.  Some authorities would be very surprised at the response they would get.  This country is heavily armed, by good guys as well as bad guys.  If I was in government I wouldn't want to give them all a reason to unite against me.  100 million people united in a cause could make serious changes to their status quo.   Apollo 13   Holly.

I would go to Japan and destroy every whaling vessel in the country.     Fruits.  I'm snacking on cherry tomatoes as I type.   When you're on live tv.   I watched a video once where they took a bunch of plants and divided them into two groups.  They separated the two and hooked the second group up to electrodes that measured their electric impulses.  In an area separated by a wall, they chopped up a plant from the first group.  As they whacked away, the electrodes recorded highly increased activity in the plants that were separated, as if they were screaming whenever the plant was cut.  Weird stuff.  Also, the movement of plant roots as they grow seem to be purposeful movement and always head towards the nutrients, crowding out non-relative plants to the point of their deaths.  Some plants send out distress signals to predator insects while being eaten by certain insects, so that predator insects will come and destroy the insect that's eating the host plant.  Daughter vines can "smell" the type of plant they want to attach to, so my question is, how do they do all this without a brain?  It's purposeful behaviour.   One that sticks out in my mind is "Flawless" with Robert De Niro and Philip Seymour Hoffman.  PSH was exquisite in his role as a transwoman.

Jut click the link directly above their comment on their comment page. /u/happytappin   There are so many things in your comment that I disagree with, but I'll comment on this one:   "Society cannot correctly set and achieve it's goals without the direction and vision of government because it is controlled by the ignorant horde that we know as the masses."  Do you not understand that you are also considered one of the ignorant masses?  Societies can't set or achieve goals *because of* governments like you're suggesting.  Politicians of any sort aren't ones to be trusted with the common good, just the opposite.  They enjoy their corrupting activities and having control.  They're egomaniacs who have only their own best interests in view.     If you mean in private messages, you can't.   The Lisa Nowak story was pretty weird.

[Link](http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/02/05/space.love/index.html?section=cnn_latest)   I'm confused on what you want to see.  You can see what anyone posts by clicking on their name.   Politics and religion.   I don't see much of that here.   "creationism is mocked and disregarded", I'm afraid that's what you'll get here, as well.   The notion that respect must be earned first, before being extended.   "religion makes people easier to rule".   I can't agree less on this point.  "I don't want to directly force religion onto people because that causes the masses to resent authority".  People resent authority, religiously oriented or not and you cannot force religious belief at all.    "via, evolution God's means of creating etc" You cannot force someone to mentally accept what they do not agree with.  "government should be geared toward the advancement of human intelligence and ability".  No, this is not the responsibility of government, it is the responsibility of society.  It is generally agreed that the most important single function of government is to secure the rights and freedoms of individual citizens. Thomas Jefferson asked:  "Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with his wrath?" Government becomes primarily a mechanism for defense against bodily harm, theft and involuntary servitude. It cannot claim the power to redistribute the wealth or force reluctant citizens to perform acts of charity against their will. Government is created by the people, for the people, not for an oligarch.   It's so weird how things like that happen in slow motion, time just slows down.  This guy had head injuries too, unfortunately, they were too great to sustain his life.  People in too big of a hurry take so many  chances with other people's lives than they're aware of.

My dog because he might be too stupid to get out on his own.  The cat would be out in a heartbeat.   It's death knell.    "Do you agree that the hyper-liberalism that is American liberalism will lead to a state of nature, and that though too religiously oriented and restrictive, American conservatism is more conducive to progress, simply because of it's ability to ultimately maintain a civilized society better than American liberalism in the long run?"  No, neither are conducive to progress, only to eventual self-destruction.  A completely new paradigm would be needed for "progress".

If martial law were to ever be declared, if the government ever seized our financial assets in some way or if some other country decided to invade us, I would bet highly on armed conflict from people country-wide.  There are many reasons this country would fight back and fight back mightily, but, I don't think politics is one of them.  We'd all have to be affected personally.   I would want that person to be required to work with 55% of his/her salary given to the family of the murder victim for the rest of his/her life.   It's not any more or any less acceptable.  Who makes your rules?   That gives the impression that she's divorced from him and now married to someone else.  Early husband or first husband implies divorce, not death.

 Made a room and tried to wb with a friend. Both using android and its stuck on searching for ally. Is it still buggy from SB update?   I just bought the phone off someone and the software is still at 4.1.2. I tried to manually update it from the RUU provided by HTC website but my phone gets stuck at the 'loading bootloader' and causes the phone to disconnect from my laptop, ending the updating process. On top of that it gets stuck on a black screen that just says HTC and the only way to restart the phone is by pressing power and volume down button. Is there a way to fix it or something or am I doomed to forever use 4.1.2 (I had Verizon's HTC One M7 at 4.4.2 and I love the UI and the personalization feel of it)  Note: Phone is not rooted or anything   I use to do it every day whenever I have tickets, now I'm just whatever still in bronze...

If you are researching if a company has credibility I would use BKR Tiel. Or the bigger american company's Moody's or Standaard and Poor's. Your embassy can help you out also and if you are client of the bigger accounting firms; PWC, Ernst   Young (EY) or KPMG they are widely represented in the Netherlands. Good Luck!   Hi Docs,  Is it ok for a patient (me) when I visit my doctor to come up with some diseases I found on the internet? But very well thought out so all symptoms fit and I did a lot of research. I'm currently in a situation where my doctors also don't know at the moment what is going on with me exactly, but they do know something isn't right.   For example I had a hypophysitis but we only found out because I had done research myself and noticed that all my symptoms where the same as Addisons Disease or low cortisol and I informed my doctor and he drawed some blood and from there on all the doctors did the rest off course  and I also failed the stimulation test by the way. Luckily with the proper treatment this is 100% gone now.  But do doctors hate this? Or do doctors see this as annoying?   I'm asking this because I want a good patient/doctor relationship.   making dragon ball Z character themed websites for fun with dreamweaver and Delta Force land warrior.

That would be terrible, although I think he will just go to work tomorrow, he should be way to happy with the new job that something like this shouldn't knock him out!    No it's not clear, first he says he wants to be nice, then he gives him one subject "reddit", the new guy obviously hasn't got any clue what OP interest more. My guess is that the new guy is very shy or just is trying to be nice.   The best thing OP could do is just say Hi I like more stuff then reddit, for example basketball or baseball or what so, or he would be honest and say we started of the wrong foot.  What OP did now is fucked up, obviously his co-worker is reading this TIFU and he or she will feel ashamed tomorrow or will be straight off pissed or he doesn't give a shit.  Great way to welcome your new co-workers!   Last 10 years it has become much and much nicer with the new train station and the Zuidpoort!  Well at the cafe's and bars the coffee is most of the time pretty decent.  Glad you enjoyed it!    Born and Raised in Delft checking in. Where did you get the good coffee?   I remember the post! Congrats!  From those two I would pick Amsterdam, but if you get the chance to go to Leiden I would choose Leiden, It's close to Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam but it's all personal taste. Maybe you should visit both cities before you make a choice if you have the possibility.  Good luck!      Dude just share more about yourself, he really wants to talk with you but he has no clue about what. Don't act like such a dick head and show some interest in some of your co-workers.    Why an intern for you marketing position? It's probably gonna make or brake your whole company especially in the beginning the marketing department. Find a good companion or a more experienced marketing employee.  but back to you question, did you tried twitter/linkedin/Instagram? Maybe here on Reddit? Approach NYU directly not only looking around on there website but call them and ask them if they want to put your company in there database for students.  Maybe there is a blogger in your city who is blogging about your profession or product category. If you have done market research you would probably already know a couple. Ask them they probably have friends how need some internship.  You still have Columbia and Berkeley College in NYC and a couple more. So there is a lot of opportunities here.

 I'd advise you to goto one of the folk-music seminars/camps like the Plovdiv seminar, Ross Daily's thing,  Macedonian pearl seminar,  Amala School, etc... Without connections or language skills you'll have  a very difficult time arranging things on your own in only 10 days.    In america speaking 3 languages is the equivalent of a PhD   DOWNVOTED. Here's why User "Kristinchen" only shares links from this website. The Article says:   ITS NO LONGER ABOUT PORTRAYING AN IMAGE THROUGH EXCESS AND LOGOS. MODERN DAY LUXURY IS ALL ABOUT INTEGRITY.  Well then why is Absolut's 'handcrafted hard to find luxury Elyx brand mentioned at every turn?  THIS IS AN AD.   Read this. Everyone has slightly different needs but this article is pretty good. http://michaelkammes.com/audio/prepping-and-exporting-for-post-audio-in-final-cut-pro/   I'm in NYC   Thanks for your help! It's a doc so there isn't really much subby material so I think I'm probably fine in that dept unless I'm overlooking something? Theater speakers are full range and the LFE is literally for LFE(?) Is there crossover that I'm overlooking and need to account for?     Room isn't treated but I have a pretty good understanding of its deficiencies. Mixing LCR so 5.1 minus 2.1...    Hi Folks,  I'm mixing a film that got picked up for a festival. My small room is loosely calibrated to -79dB on my nearfields. When I print the stems I want to make sure this thing is going to translate decently to the theater. Are there any steps I can take from my room to make absolutely sure there aren't any surprises when it gets to the theater?    I've rarely had a problem with my big guerrini which I know fits perfectly in the overhead of a large transatlantic flight. That said I know professionals who will actually take the instrument apart into its two halves and have separate cases for each.     Chalga. Love it? hate it?... or love it after 2 drinks?    Fish sauce and shallots.   np- still learning the basics myself.  If you can't find kafir lime, you can dilute normal lime juice with a little mayer lemon.   You want the little fresh or pickled "bird's eye" peppers used in Thai and Indian food for CHILLI PASTE.   However what you are making is CURRY paste, which is different. For that you're best bet is **dried** puya peppers. You mash them up in a mortar and pestle with all the other stuff. Some trouble-shooting tips for 'ya are:   * When making your curry, first sautee the paste alone in oil for a bit until fragrant to cook all the raw shallots/garlic/other stuff.   * You are correct to add sugar. Best bet is to dilute **palm sugar** (not white granulated cane sugar) in a mixture or lime juice and fish sauce. Then add that to the pot to incorporate it into the paste.  Add coconut milk after.   * The boxed coconut milk is better than the canned.  * finish it all off with some unsweetened coconut cream once your protein is cooked (not cream of coconut or creamed coconut).  *I've never used it since my city has access to thai stuff, but you could try http://www.templeofthai.com/ for ingredients. I'm guessing you may have also been missing galangal and lime leaves too which makes a world of difference.        I do it all the time for live theater, and have never had a problem with hair noise. I usually use 2 toupee clips, hiding the cable under a part of hair, securing a loop of cable to the back of the neck with skinprep+transpore. The mic sits centrally right at the hairline, best situation are bangs to hide it. You can match the cable color to the hair with shoe paint, just be sure to cover the element with a little e-tape first so you don't mess it up. You can color the element itself with a paint marker.    Mic + pot of hot oil + something frying in it.       There are a bunch of video on youtube of how to do it. I just seasoned mine yesterday and it worked fine:   Basically, scrubbed the waxy stuff out of it with warm water, detergent, and a scouring pad. Then I heated it up on my range  REALLY HOT. Next rubbed oil all around in it. Then burned that in occasionally rotating it around to hit as much of the surface as I could- you're going for a smooth burnt black finish on the inside.    I've heard of an alternate method using salt to get the same effect but I don't know much about it.    Could it be some kind of metadata or a copyright marking trick?   actually paying far under the stabilized rate   According to NYC housing code my landlord is legally obligated to renew my lease after it expires. He also never disclosed that the apt. is rent stabilized and I found it out later (illegal although I don't really care). Should I continue to bug him to formally renew it, or in the eyes of the law am I safe and still covered. (see below)   The catch: My lease has a clause that it's good for a year (which has passed) and "thereafter it shall become a month-to-month tenancy."  Later it says, "TERMINATION: After expiration of the leasing period, this agreement is automatically renewed from month to month, but may be terminated by either party giving the other a 30-day written notice of intention to terminate. Where laws require "just cause," such just cause shall be so stated on said notice..."    Am I safe from sudden eviction or is he legally permitted to kick me out after a months notice? (a bad situation to be be in)   CHEESE!  	22

 Sorry if you felt misled--the article is centered on NEWS SUPPRESSION IN THE UNITED STATES...(the term is in the first sentence)  PBS is definitely quite dependent on foundations which don't want ruffled feathers...the Ford Foundation also has CIA ties...  Here's a [**IMGUR**](http://imgur.com/gallery/5vxh8im) I made if anyone likes the Moyers quote...  EDIT: Happy 81st Bill...   AWESOME...I think people really give Roger Stone the shaft--he's a gifted writer with plenty of colorful stories which unmask the personalities of LBJ and Nixon. One of his books (in free pdf) is posted at r/TSBD   THINK about what you would say if a Chinese or Russian newspaper merely regurgitated allegations with no On the Record comments--and zero verifiable proof of the damage. Most likely, you wouldn't even read about it--because the US Corporate Media wouldn't even print the allegations.  FEAR is good for the US economy--last year the FBI-DHS both announced large increases in their budgets for fighting international hackers.          The Saudis have had a cozy relationship with the CIA since the 80's--they even helped fund the Contras...most likely the Saudis supplied the patsies and some funding...the head of Pakistan's ISI was in DC at a meeting with Bob Graham and Porter Goss on the morning of 9/11--one week later he was forced to step down after a newspaper from India published an article which claimed there was a $100,000 money transfer from the ISI chief to Mohammed Atta.  You can also find a fox news report on youtube which raises serious questions about Israeli Mossad agents being arrested on 9/11--if you look hard I think you can even find interviews with NJ cops who actually arrested the Israelis.   I think NIST said 2.5 seconds--hitting freefall for any amount of time should be a huge red flag which ought to be prominent in any investigation.   I also think it defies logic to have nearly symmetrical downfall from asymmetrical damage.   I noticed that in the guardian's story--they quoted both AP and Reuters...but, as usual, not one On the Record comment. The timing is also key--with Sec. of Defense Carter making aggressive statements about China's building an island to use as a military base in the South China Sea. (at least China didn't invade/overthrow a country to acquire a military base which is what the US seems to do)   The larger subreddits are officially part of the Military-Media-Industrial-Intelligence-Corporate-Congressional Complex*...either jump on board with WAR, INC. or be shadow banned.  (MIC)^2 Complex            I watched this the other day:   [Taliban offers to hand UBL over if the U.S. can provide evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5401gaR7fIk)   WAR, INC. has taken over--the MIC has now officially grown into the Military-Media-Industrial-Intelligence-Corporate-Congressional Complex...  The Corporate Media sees bombings and articles teaching us how to hate are GOOD--while actual photos or articles exposing the destruction are BAD.      Agree--sad how many Americans today don't have any care that many now claim over 3 million deaths in the aftermath of the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan + Iraq after 9/11.   props to the history channel--thanks for sharing...      FUCK--awesome find OP...seems to be pure "raw" intelligence.  I wonder who's handwriting that is and who assembled this.  I also don't know why this would be removed from r/conspiracy.   After taking a plea deal, Drake has claimed the NSA should have prevented 9/11 and criticized the runaway, expensive programs.  ------------  [Written Statement of Thomas Drake before EU PArliament](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201310/20131001ATT72162/20131001ATT72162EN.pdf)  ----------  [Speech before the EU Parliament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02ljBDNr100)--16min 45sec  -----------  [NSA Insiders Reveal What Went Wrong](https://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/) January, 2014  -------------    ------------  [Written Statement of Thomas Drake before EU PArliament](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201310/20131001ATT72162/20131001ATT72162EN.pdf)  ----------  [Speech before the EU Parliament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02ljBDNr100)--16min 45sec  -----------  [NSA Insiders Reveal What Went Wrong](https://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/) January, 2014  -------------          "OOPSIE!!!

Nixon has been dead since 1994...Kissinger should be prosecuted.   funny how r/politics won't take any of washingtonsblog.com article--"rehosted" content.   never heard about that...   I checked...not sure why but I could only find short clips on youtube (except for 1 very bad version)...  I'm a truther , too...I think Bush/Cheney didn't want any suspects on U.S. soil because they knew they couldn't control the cover-up under normal U.S. court procedures. It's completely absurd that the 9/11 Commission was only initially given $3 million--yet the SSCI initially funded the Torture Report Re-write (in Dec. 2008) with $40 million off the bat. This was so CIA-approved attorneys could shred the Torture Report from 6,300 pages down to 400 pages.  And, Yes--it's definitely infuriating.         Israel apoligized by agreeing to take BILLIONS upon BILLIONS of U.S. Military Aid...  BTW: did you know that Allen Dulles was called "Allie" by his family? read it in Stephen Kinzer's *THE BROTHERS* (pdf at r/TSBD)   Chris Hedges touches on this quite a bit--he says the U.S. has experienced a "slow motion corporate coup d'etat" where economics trumps politics...he also goes into Inverted Totalitarianism.   I think Mitchell's company billed the CIA (and us taxpayers) for $80 Million   https://news.vice.com/video/the-architect         you're welcome--tried to sticky FINAL JUDGMENT (it won't let me for some reason).

We have spent $4 TRILLION in Iraq and Afghanistan--for nothing.  UBL was in Pakistan...remember???   $40 BILLION to kill 1 terrorist...so???  the FBI never even charged UBL with 9/11 either...  Even more atrocious is the 3 million people who have died in Iraq + Afghanistan since 9/11.   The U.S. is just an exposed bully fighting to keep its over-extended Empire at this point. Obama has committed War Crimes as well--over 1,000 drone strikes. I'd assume Obama also gave the wink to NATO before Libya was thrown into chaos.   The U.S. has spent $[**4 Trillion in Afghanistan and Iraq to catch UBL**](http://jfkfacts.org/assassination/uncategorized/the-exorbinant-cost-of-the-war-on-terror/#more-12113) and his partners who planned and carried out the attacks of 9/11...if there were 100 terrorists who planned and facilitated 9/11--that means the U.S. has spent $40 Billion to capture or kill EACH of the 100 terrorists.

The first book I read from the Russian side was Antony Beevor's collection of Vasily Grossman's writing titled [**A WRITER AT WAR**](http://www.antonybeevor.com/index.php/previous-books/a-writer-at-war-vasily-grossman-with-the-red-army-1941-1945/).  I've also been looking into the root causes of the Cold War--which was much more a manufactured product than many Americans can wrap their heads around. Antony Sutton dug a bit too deep into Stanford's research collection and revealed that 90% of Soviet technology was derived from the West--certainly made the Establishment (aka the profiteers) uncomfortable.

Harry Truman dropped 2 nukes on Japan--supposedly there would not be deaths due to radiation after the initial blast...More importantly, Truman signed the [National Security Act of 1947](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Act_of_1947) which renamed the WAR DEPARTMENT into a much more appealing Department of Defense. The National Security Act also created the CIA--which was supposed to be "an intelligence gathering arm of the President," but which turned into an out of control agency which some have pegged responsible (directly or indirectly) for up to 30 million deaths. The failure of Truman to control the drawdown of WWII eventually blew up to become what Eisenhower would call the Military Industrial Complex.  Harry Truman also created the [Truman Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Doctrine)--which threw the Cold War into high gear. The CIA brainiacs decided to give former nazi SS Eastern Front Intelligence Chief Reinhard Gehlen $5 million to start an intelligence agency in West Germany--this lead to many deaths in Eastern Europe as Gehlen's men were often double agents and even sold the CIA completely bunk information...Pay people millions of dollars--and they will tell you what you want to hear! The CIA has also infiltrated U.S. colleges/universities, but, most importantly, the MEDIA. Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Guatemala, Iran...etc...We are now sold wars on the basis of "spreading democracy"--and most Americans have no idea (or care) that there have been 3 million killed in the Middle East since 9/11.   Even Truman's Marshall Plan (which was intended to help fund the rebuilding of 16 cities in Europe and Asia after WWII) indirectly was responsible for many deaths: The CIA pilfered at least 5% (about $600 million) of the $15+ Billion Marshall Plan to fund their dirty operations around the globe. The funds were diverted to buy mansions for station chiefs--but mostly to buy weapons and to act as political slush funds iaround the globe:  Greece, Italy, France--even Japan. NATO was formed in 1949--the CIA and the intelligence agencies of western Europe created Operation Gladio (insert many more deaths).  Astoundingly, Harry Truman was also indirectly responsible for the death of JFK--he even wrote an [editorial in the *Washington Post*](http://www.maebrussell.com/Prouty/Harry%20Truman%27s%20CIA%20article.html) which ran on 12-22-63. The editorial stated that the CIA was supposed to be an intelligence gathering arm of the President--not a runaway operations and dirty tricks squad.  Truman wrote: "For some time I have been disturbed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas." cough cough.  Anyone who has read *Legacy of Ashes: A History of the CIA* knows that often it is not only the president who doesn't know what the CIA is doing--sometimes the director of the CIA doesn't even know all the different operations going on inside his own agency. The "War on Drugs" should also be thrown in--the CIA and the military have been connected to drug running and laundering of drug money from Vietnam to South America and, yes, even the Middle East...(Afghanistan's poppy yield in 2001 was virtually eliminated--today under U.S.-Taliban control it is the world's largest supply)   Israel said "SORRY" by accepting BILLIONS upon BILLIONS of U.S. Military Aid.

If you pay "consultants" billions upon billions, year after year--they will eventually tell you what you want to hear.

Yeah, sorry...my french is bad so I figured anyone would just slam my translation:  approximately: "In your opinion, which nation contributed the most to the defeat of Germany in 1945"   Besides the obvious rampant militarism--Hollywood and the Pentagon have literally turned [**WWII**](http://www.les-crises.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/sondage-nation-contribue-defaite-nazis.jpg) upside-down.      WRONG--the current system of allowing rampant secrecy makes it impossible for WE THE PEOPLE (and our elected representatives) to hold the agencies ACCOUNTABLE for their actions...we now have a broken, corrupt system of oversight of the CIA-NSA-DIA-DoD (etc.)--these agencies (and their contractors) can torture, kill, bomb, drone with impunity--because they know the POTUS will never be held accountable either...  POTUS and the Three fucking Letter Agencies KNOW they can endlessly stall investigations...there is ZERO oversight at this point--where does this ugly road end?   I included the bit about the bombing of Wall Street because I have: 1) read the book...and 2) it is one of the oldest series of files which remain kept from the public that I know of...I have heard there are even files from WWI which remain unreleased to the public--but I have never studied WWI   [Defense Intelligence Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Intelligence_Agency)   There is no valid reason for not releasing documents which are 95 years old. Some of the docs may be from private investigators--but all the docs produced by U.S./State/local agencies should be released to the public in full and without redactions.  I would even make the argument that ALL documents which government agencies produce should be released IN FULL and without redactions no later than 4 years after their creation date.    Neither...it's the DIA which, to quote John Judge, has "10 times the budget and 100 times the manpower of the CIA."         **Q**: How can we *know our own history* when so much of it is kept secret from us for decades?   Some examples:   + Even much of the early funding for the CIA was kept secret from the public for about 50 years. The CIA pilfered at least 5% of the Marshall Plan funds--at least $680 million out of the $15 Billion+ which was supposed to go to rebuild 16 cities in Europe and Asia after WWII--instead went to fund CIA operations.  + There are still plenty of WWII records NOT RELEASED--check Operation Paperclip...  + Yale history professor Beverly Gage wrote a book in 2008 about the 1920 bombing of Wall Street--yet she couldn't get any files released about the event almost 90 years later...Gage wrote about this in the appendix to her book *The Day Wall Street Exploded*.  + John Stockwell noted in the mid-80's that the Church investigations of the 70's had taken the time to count the number of CIA Operations--they found that in the first 25 years the CIA had run about 9,000 small-scale operations and 3,000 large-scale operations...      As if the DoD needed even more ways to cause Death and Destruction.  We all know who the Biggest Bully on the Block is.  How is the U.S. considered "peaceful" when it is the only country to ever use nuclear weapons in war, openly admits to torture after 9/11 of hundreds (if not thousands), have committed thousands of drone strikes, and spy on almost every person, business, agency and government in the world--including their own citizens and politicians.    [**WAR PROPAGANDA: U.S. CIA-DoD PLANTING STORIES IN THE NEWS CHAIN**](http://www.globalresearch.ca/war-propaganda-planting-stories-in-the-news-chain/5451318)...      Last week Frontline proved what a waste of your time they are with a vacuous "investigation" of the Decade Old CIA-Pentagon Torture--there was absolutely nothing new in the Frontline report (except for a couple of scraps about the CIA feeding info to Hollywood...which we already knew).   PBS/Frontline is following the TRAITORS of the entire corporate news cabal--the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC, FOX--they have all FAILED to investigate and print the TRUTH.  They have all sold their corporate souls and allowed the POTUS and the Pentagon to give them permission to print. Rather than defend the freedom of the press, these corporate prostitutes have settled for PROFITS over TRUTH.   As we saw with James Risen's investigation of the Patriot Act--the NYT was all too willing to hold back the story for 18 months. It was only after Risen went out and got a book deal that the NYT finally printed his report (which won a Pulitzer). Even when these TRAITORS report on a story--you should know it is filled with Pentagon Propaganda and Half-Truths.  It is Useless to watch Frontline anymore--unless you want to expose yourself to the CIA-Pentagon Propaganda Wurlizter.         there's also what could be a Mobile Command   Control Communications Center parked at the corner...  http://www.jfkassassinationgallery.com/albums/userpics/10001/Towner1_Life_1967.jpg      Glad you enjoyed it...pretty funny how the two were completely befuddled by a possible cover-up by the Rockefeller commission (the Rockefellers have long-standing CIA ties which go back into the OSS WWII days)   Thanks for the input--glad to see you questioning things!  -------------------  "It is the first responsibility of every citizen to question the government."  --Benjamin Franklin, Conspiracist     I've been wondering since Belzer said that...it would be very interesting to take a peek at released/unclassified British intelligence files on what Allen Dulles was doing during WWII (and beyond)...we do know quite a bit of background on the Dulles family and their involvement with Sullivan   Cromwell...they were even involved in the post-WWI settlements...In Stephen Kinzer's book **Brothers**, he points out that one of Allen Dulles' ancestors actually helped arrange the overthrow of the Queen of Hawaii in 1893...(it was a bloodless coup...Hawaii wasn't a U.S. state until 1898)   **Richard Belzer**: "...not wanting to go through with the Bay of Pigs and wanting to get out of Vietnam--that's why he was murdered. Because there's so much money that was made in Vietnam--tons of money--and that prolonged the war without reason. Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex and Kennedy understood it. He came in office and inherited the Bay of Pigs from Eisenhower and the CIA and some of the people in the military lied to Kennedy about what would happen in Cuba. So the reach of the CIA has gone beyond it's charter. He fired Allan Dulles, the head of the CIA. He said I'm going to shatter the CIA into thousands of pieces because they went beyond their charter. **They're supposed to be covert**--they're not supposed to be starting wars. Even Harry Truman was appalled at what was going on because some elements of his government were getting nazi war criminals into our country illegally--subverting the will of the Nuremberg trials--because we wanted the neo-nazi scientists. There's a lot of dark stuff--but it's in the public domain. There's thousands of pages that can't be released until 2075. But there's an interesting thing in 2014--England's statute of limitations on certain things can come out. And what we're going to find out from that is Allan Dulles--who was the CIA head fired by Kennedy--was later on the Warren Commission...Allan Dulles should have been hung for treason for what he did during World War Two. He worked for the nazis throughout the war--hid money for American and English bankers. He was one of the most contemptable people ever--Allan Dulles." (last 3 minutes of 15 minute May, 2013 interview: http://www.politico.com/multimedia/video/2013/05/richard-belzer-book-tackles-jfk-conspiracies.html)    certainly would have been a much different discussion if they were going over the Zapruder frame-by-frame and Brugioni could comment as the film rolled...i still think Brugioni coming out is a very large step which points even further towards a cover-up. One of the best insider accounts we could ask for in terms of an actual upper-level CIA-approved insider speaking out.   sorry--couldn't decipher that...lots of people seem to be leaving reddit--but that's what the corporate heads want...a safe zone where uncomfortable facts don't get in the way.   Don't bother with the FACTS...just degrade the film and keep on believing that Warren Report BS.  You put forth no logical argument--just negative attitude.   Understood--didn't want to violate any rules...but thought this was a strong report that deserves to be seen!  Hopefully a few people will check it out--it really shows how these GA politicians prostitute themselves. (other states are alluded to as well)      why are you attacking the films I post with just CHEAP PUT DOWNS instead of attacking the CONTENT???  Obviously, it's much easier for you to resort to cheap shots than actually put forth a logical argument.   the "shitty doc" you refer to used primarily Corporate news reports which have never been followed up on--what is wrong with continuing to ask questions when the USG and the intelligence agencies have so obviously stalled and obstructed the 9/11 investigations? Even the [**9/11 Commission Co-Chairs wrote a letter**](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/) to the *NYT* stating their investigation was obstructed by the White House and the CIA. One former 9/11 Commission member was asked if we need another 9/11 Commission--he stated that "We need at least Fifteen 9/11 Commissions."  In *The Zapruder Film Mystery* Doug Horne, former chief analyst of military records at the Assassination Records Review Board--from the NATIONAL ARCHIVES actually has found several of the men who worked on the Zapruder film for the CIA over the weekend of 11-22-63.   If all of you quit with your knee-jerk reactions you might actually learn something someday. I have a feeling you are too fucking brainwashed and think the USG is a benevolent association which bombs the world for democracy. Good Luck with that--someday our children will be paying for all these bullshit fucking wars (maybe us, too)...all of that may happen sooner than you think as the world switches off the PetroDollar--it may turn out our only friends only liked the U.S. because we had money and a gun pointed at them.  -----------  well--I'm glad there are at least a couple of open-minded people out there who appreciate the film!!!      twitter it   facebook it  text it  post it  spread it like icing on your birthday cake!!!

John Stockwell referred to the Church Committee investigation which counted CIA Operations between 1947-1972: 9,000 small-scale operations and 3,000 large-scale operations--every one of them secret, every one of them, by definition, a conspiracy. As the fucking CIA has now been around for almost 70 years--you can Triple these numbers: 27,000 small-scale operations and 9,000 large-scale operations which the public has virtually no information about. The files we are given access to are also heavily fucking redacted.  We know the CIA and the DoD are extremely secretive and extremely compartmentalized. During the Vietnam War, Daniel Ellsberg finally read the Pentagon Papers which clearly showed that the U.S. would have to commit 500K to 1 million soldiers to control South Vietnam--yet, this remained SECRET (even from the President) with only a few traitorous fucking generals knowing this info.

Senior officials at the NSA were even read their Miranda rights."](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/10/02/the-nsa-and-me/)      First of all: According to John Judge--the DIA is supposed to have 10X the budget of the CIA with 100X the manpower. The DARPA program is the fucking Boot Stomping on your Face that Orwell warned us about.   There was a program in the 90's which was updated around 2000 and became DARPA. (I can't find the links--but cryptome has both of the reports on their site).  Before 9/11, the DoD (under which the DIA operates) ran an OPERATION DARKHEART which ID'd at least 4 of the 9/11 hijackers 16 months before 9/11 via "open source intelligence". I think DARKHEART was a TRIAL which was meant to be further refined and put in place once more funds became available after 9/11.   The DoD cannot account for $8.5 TRILLION since 1996...It's also fucking scary that the DoD has no restraints when it comes to running OPS on Americans who are in the U.S.  I didn't watch the whole video--but knowing that the DoD and CIA regularly work in lockstep with Hollywood and the corporate news sycophants...this is just another step towards 100% Totalitarianism: a corporate-fascist state.  America has sold itself to corporate overlords...you own tax dollars have paid for this runaway train. All that's left to do now is to sit back and watch WWIII as the U.S. takes over using the 650 military bases on foreign soil to attempt to: 1) save the U.S. economy and; 2) control energy and other vital resources by plundering the countries under U.S. control...enjoy the show!!!

Below are two excerpts from [*INSIDE THE COMPANY: A CIA DIARY*](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/comments/30oi1g/inside_the_company_cia_diary_by_philip_agee/) by Philip Agee (1975)...just THINK about how much the CIA and all the other agencies have grown since then--in 1990 there were 11 intelligence agencies, today there are (at least) 17. after 9/11 the intell agencies and their contractors grew exponentially beyond anything Agee could have imagined in 1975...   ---------  When I joined the CIA I believed in the need for its existence. After twelve years with the agency I finally understood how much suffering it was causing, that millions of people all over the world had been killed or had had their lives destroyed by the CIA and the institutions it supports. I couldn't sit by and do nothing and so began work on this book. Excerpts:  --------------  Even after recent revelations about the CIA it is still difficult for people to understand what a huge and sinister organization the CIA is. It is the biggest and most powerful secret service that has ever existed. I don't know how big the KGB is inside the Soviet Union, but its international operation is small compared with the CIA's. The CIA has 16,500 employees and an annual budget of $750,000,000. That does not include its mercenary armies or its commercial subsidiaries. Add them all together, the agency employs or subsidizes hundreds of thousands of people and spends billions every year. Its official budget is secret; it's concealed in those of other Federal agencies. Nobody tells the Congress what the CIA spends. By Law, the CIA is not accountable to Congress.  -------------   I'm sure you can go to archive.org and look up the Church Committee and find the actual figures they released in the report...or you can listen to [**John Stockwell**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3ioJGMCr-Y) (a former CIA Operations Director)...  it's not worth my time to do the research for you because I don't think you've even bothered to watch the Tom Daschle video link above--where he clearly states that Dick Cheney asked him on "several occasions" NOT to investigate 9/11...     Body Language 101...   FBI director Louis Freeh wasn't with the program--so he resigned and was AWOL for about 6 months leading up to 9/11...ABLE DANGER was a TRIAL to be put in place after 9/11--not an attempt to actually catch anyone...  The anthrax scare was used to bully politicians and the press/population into obedience...leaks about this could be dragged out at anytime--to distract if there was a HOT story...likewise the constant threat level (orange, red, etc)...  The press began reporting possible Torture by the US in early 2002 (Feb. or March)--this could be leaked to STOP a hot story as well...  wikileaks, CIA torture, Snowden--they are all battles worth losing to cover up the Largest Crime ever on American soil...there have been NO budget cuts--and if there were the DoD can switch funds easily (there are no audits)...no one was ever Fired from their jobs, either...  the DoD-CIA know that the farther away in time we get--the less the public cares (and the less they will remember)...     At the time, Cheney-Bush claimed it was "because we were at war and couldn't afford to distract resources". But, I think it was far more devious than that:   1. [**Cheney-Bush asked Senator Tom Daschle NOT**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pTt2cQvUww) to have the Senate-House of Representatives Intelligence Committees Investigate (this was known as the "Joint Commission")  2. Cheney-Bush Stalled the formation of the 9/11 Commission and underfunded the Commission once it was finally formed--the 9/11 Commission was initially funded with only $3 million. For reference, the investigation of Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinski cost over $40 million...in 2008 the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence funded the Torture Report with $40 million--this was to EDIT a 6,300 page report using only CIA-approved attorneys (not to write the report!). The 9/11 Commission would eventually receive about $14 million in total--about one-third of the cost of the Torture Report (Re-Write).  3. Cheney-Bush attempted to place Henry Kissinger (CIA-insider) as Commissioner of the 9/11 Commission. [**HK met with some of the victims' families**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmHPfXemf10) in his office--they asked him if his law firm would disclose a list of clients (to make sure there were no potential conflicts of interest). HK wouldn't disclose and turned the position down.   4. The eventual Commissioner would be Lee Hamilton (and Thomas Kean)--who had served on the Iran-Contra hearings with (guess who?)...Dick Cheney...In 1989, after they successfully shut down the open Iran-Contra Hearings from revealing too much--Dick Cheney was awarded by the new president, GHW Bush (former CIA Director), with a nice step up: Secretary of Defense (even tho Cheney had taken 5 deferments during Vietnam)  5. The 9/11 Commission was given a tight timeframe: 16 months (compare that to the 4 years which the Torture Report rewrite was allowed). In addition, the 9/11 Commission office in DC was in a CIA managed building...(remember the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence scandal last year in which the CIA was SPYING on the SSCI)  5. The first thing Cheney did in office was to hold his secret Energy Task Force meetings--the ACLU and the press demanded to know info about the meetings but was denied. [**Eventually--2 years later**](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2003/07/18/cheney-energy-task-force-documents-detail-iraqi-oil-industry.html) the ACLU was able to get a few pages of their meeting released (one of the pages was a map of Iraqi oilfields along with what companies were under contract). Cheney and the CIA also planned for [**Regime Change in Iraq**](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4499540/scott-ritter-claims-regime-change-us-policy-goal-towards-iraq-1990-2003) since the 90's...  6. During the 90's--after the fall of the USSR, the US defense and intelligence agencies were hurting from budget cuts and scandals--and, even  worse, could no longer yell "COMMIE!!!" and receive Billions. After GHW Bush left office, Cheney went to Halliburton--but one of Cheney's last acts as Sec. of Defense was to fund a study examining the potential for privatizing some functions of the DoD.  7. Ultimately, YES, 9/11 was a long-planned, super-compartmentalized DoD-CIA operation with a goal to give the US a new Super Villain and thereby revive the defense and intelligence sectors. For those who think hundreds or thousands had to know--that's BS--the CIA-DIA operates in extreme secrecy. In the mid-70's the Church Committee took a look at CIA operations: [**the CIA had run 9,000 small operations and 3,000 large operations**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3ioJGMCr-Y) between 1947-1972...every one of the operations was the definition of a conspiracy.  8. In addition, Cheney-Bush shut down the SEC investigation of the stock market profiteers who placed PUT options on United on 9/11. The Patriot Act was forced down the throats of Congress, [**the intelligence agencies**](http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/) and the defense contractors expanded exponentially. Booz Allen (which the Carlyle Group would buy) even began getting millions of dollars in  September, 2001.  9. After the victims' families and the press finally pressured President Bush to testify before the 9/11 Commission, the President of the United States finally agreed...but only if it was NOT under oath, NOT in public and NO notes were taken...The President also demanded he be allowed to have Dick Cheney hold his hand, too. Bush-Cheney had screamed "9-11" from the rooftops on a daily basis--but couldn't even officially testify in public and on the record to the 9/11 Commission. As a bonus insult, Bush held a [**5-minute "press conference"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bnuvtRo8b0) afterwards in which only 6 questions were asked. Odd that C-Span has deleted the press conference--9/11 researcher Jon Gold posted it for us on youtube (otherwise we might not be able to see it). Please watch the "press conference" for yourself and note the words and body language--is this man telling us the full truth? Notice he can't even say he "testified" and has to say "I had a conversation" with...  --------------  EDIT:  what many of you are Failing to comprehend is that America is a CORPORATOCRACY--it is no longer a free republic and there is NO "democracy"...if you fill large office buildings with people and pay them six-figure salaries they will tell you what you want to hear...One example is the [**Cold War LIES**](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2fnykt/q_its_1961_the_height_of_the_cold_war_the_us_has/) that the USSR was ahead in nuclear capability--the Pentagon and CIA and the RAND corporation advised the President the Soviets had more missiles--when, in fact, the US was well ahead of the USSR. The [**DoD can't account for $8.5 TRILLION**](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/85-Trillion-Unaccounted-Should-Congress-Increase-Defense-Budget)--yet every business, every citizen and every government agency is by law required to submit to an audit every year (except for the DoD and the Three Letter Agencies)...the Military-Media-Industrial-Intelligence-Congressional Corporate Complex will sure as hell do what it has to do in order to ensure the Billions upon Billions of dollars keep flowing.

There's also this excellent [article by Washington's Blog](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/05/no-wrongdoing-here-just-6300-corporate-fines-and-settlements.html) which describes some of the 6,300 settlements the corporations have been able to negotiate--most of them with no actual prosecution. Prosecution is importrant--when an average citizen is prosecuted for a small offense there is often probation, educational classes (etc.) and the convicted is held to a higher standard while under probation.   I reposted it because the bankers have been "negotiating" their deals with the SEC.  I think it drives home the point: if you are a banker with millions to spend on fucking attorneys--HEY, no big deal...no one has to go to jail even though BILLIONS have been STOLEN from both the public and private traders which the companies handle deals for.  meanwhile, if you are poor and black or hispanic in the U.S.--you better watch the fuck out because you can be harassed/arrested/killed at any moment.            both democrats, both women, both have been on Intell committees, both have been around a long time...but I guess there are no similarities.         (article)  ----------  In an unprecedented move, the parent companies or main banking units of JPMorgan Chase   Co (JPM.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS.L), Barclays Plc (BARC.L) and UBS Group AG (UBSG.VX) are likely to plead guilty to rigging foreign exchange rates to benefit their transactions.  The banks are also scrambling to line up exemptions or waivers from the Securities and Exchanges Commission and other federal regulators because criminal pleas trigger consequences such as removing the ability to manage retirement plans or raise capital easily.  In the past, waivers have generally been granted without a hitch. However, the practice has become controversial in the past year, particularly at the SEC, where Democratic Commissioner Kara Stein has criticized the agency for rubber stamping requests and being too soft on repeat offenders.  **Negotiating some of the waivers among the SEC's five commissioners could prove challenging because many of these banks have broken criminal or civil laws in the past that triggered the need for waivers**.  Many of the banks want an SEC waiver to continue operating as "well-known seasoned issuers" so they can sell stocks and debt efficiently, people familiar with the matter said. Such a designation allows public companies to bypass SEC approval and raise capital "off the shelf" - a process that is speedier and more convenient.  Several of the people said another waiver being sought by some banks is the ability to retain a safe harbor that shields them from class action lawsuits when they make forward-looking statements.  The banks involved are also seeking waivers that will allow them to continue operating in the mutual fund business, sources said.  At least some of the waivers at issue in the forex probe will need to be put to a vote by the SEC's five commissioners. No date has been set yet, a few of the people familiar with the matter said.  The plea deals could be announced as soon as next week, two of the people said, adding that not all the penalties had been finalized yet.  Peter Carr, a spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department, declined comment on the timing or reason for a possible delay of any agreements. Citi, JPMorgan, RBS and UBS did not respond to requests for comment. A Barclays spokesman declined to comment.  The Justice Department has been negotiating with the banks for months over how to resolve allegations that **traders colluded to rig rates in the largely unregulated $5.3 trillion-a-day currency market**.  If the parent companies of U.S.-based JPMorgan and Citigroup plead guilty as planned, it would be the first time in decades that a major American financial institution has done so.  Last year, when Swiss bank Credit Suisse AG (CSGN.VX) pleaded guilty in the United States to helping wealthy Americans evade taxes, it became the largest institution in over 20 years to admit criminal wrongdoing. It was soon followed by French banking group BNP Paribas SA (BNPP.PA).  Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday night that the U.S. Justice Department voided a 2012 settlement with UBS related to interest-rate rigging.  **Citing current and former government officials, it said the negotiations were expected to result in deals next week in which UBS would pay a fine of about $200 million and plead guilty to allegations that its traders manipulated the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, before 2012**.  -----------------   Reminds me of when Defense Secretary Robert McNamara said that the attorneys told him it was OK to coat Vietnam with Agent Orange.

The George H.W. Bush administration collected documents possibly related to the 1980 events and shared some with the congressional investigation, including the Haig talking points.  But Bushs operatives  trying to protect his reelection chances in 1991-92  engaged in **delays and obstructions of the congressional inquiry**, which finally agreed after Bushs defeat by Bill Clinton in November 1992 to say that it could find no credible evidence that Reagan and Bush had orchestrated a delay in Irans release of the hostages. The hostages were finally freed on Jan. 20, 1981, immediately after Reagan was sworn in as president.  ----------------            Wow--so proud of the *Chicago Tribune* for their dedication to investigative reporting...

       Even if she might harm her immunocompromised patients?   Freakin Typhoid Mary...   "There is an unspoken understanding that you probably should be on your deathbed if you are calling in sick, one anonymous emergency room physician commented on the open-ended essay section of the survey. and [it] makes me look bad to do so (like I am weak or something). It is much, much less stressful to suck it up and come in sick than call out.   Good point. Although some of the quotes from the physicians really got me. The idea that they'll risk a patient's life so they won't "look weak" is a big problem.

There's a triceratops and a stegosaurus. I expect every intelligent person to know the difference between the two but, just in case you don't [here's a handy explanation](http://dinosaurs.findthedata.com/compare/255-278/Stegosaurus-vs-Triceratops). Right. So my desk-mate pointed to the triceratops this morning and asked if it was a stegosaurus. Rather than smacking him for not being a paleontologist, I gave a super dank explanation:   "No," said I. "It's a tricerotops. Cuz it's got tri, three, ceras on its tops!". So witty. So cool. That's why I'm the king of the workplace.  Meanwhile, another coworker walked by. He said, hey, thats what my Dad used to say when he was describing tricerotops. Now, a social adept person would have heard the phrase what my Dad used to say and figured there might be more to the story. Not me.   Hey!" said I. "Thats awesome. Your Dad is awesome. Lets invite him to the office! Why has he never been here before? Cant wait to meet your dad!! He rocks.   My coworker just stared at me sadly and walked away. Turns out his Dad is dead, and the triceratops thing was a fond childhood memory, not an invitation to remind him of his loss. Oops.  TL;DR Invited coworkers dead father to the office. Ruined a happy childhood memory involving dinosaurs. Clarified stegosaurus vs triceratops once and for all.

And I would play it with ALL participants of ANY gender.   Cuz even in the 90s, I was progressive.   OP is most definitely not with the FBI.    Here's the original study: http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms8346  Abstract: "Evaporation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the natural environment and a dominant form of energy transfer in the Earths climate. Engineered systems rarely, if ever, use evaporation as a source of energy, despite myriad examples of such adaptations in the biological world. Here, we report evaporation-driven engines that can power common tasks like locomotion and electricity generation. These engines start and run autonomously when placed at airwater interfaces. They generate rotary and piston-like linear motion using specially designed, biologically based artificial muscles responsive to moisture fluctuations. Using these engines, we demonstrate an electricity generator that rests on water while harvesting its evaporation to power a light source, and a miniature car (weighing 0.1kg) that moves forward as the water in the car evaporates. Evaporation-driven engines may find applications in powering robotic systems, sensors, devices and machinery that function in the natural environment."   Can anyone find the original paper for this? It's supposed to be in Nature Methods, but I don't see it...   Can flying fish fly?   Here's the abstract from [the original study](http://www.nature.com/srep/2015/150611/srep10768/full/srep10768.html): "Microscale soft-robots hold great promise as safe handlers of delicate micro-objects but their wider adoption requires micro-actuators with greater efficiency and ease-of-fabrication. Here we present an elastomeric microtube-based pneumatic actuator that can be extended into a microrobotic tentacle. We establish a new, direct peeling-based technique for building long and thin, highly deformable microtubes and a semi-analytical model for their shape-engineering. Using them in combination, we amplify the microtubes pneumatically-driven bending into multi-turn inward spiraling. The resulting micro-tentacle exhibit spiraling with the final radius as small as ~185 m and grabbing force of ~0.78 mN, rendering itself ideal for non-damaging manipulation of soft, fragile micro-objects. This spiraling tentacle-based grabbing modality, the direct peeling-enabled elastomeric microtube fabrication technique, and the concept of microtube shape-engineering are all unprecedented and will enrich the field of soft-robotics."

 I feel the same way about this movie !. After watching it I was very underwhelmed. It was clever, unique, and visually impressive. But when it finished I also did not get the hype. I think the hype comes from the director ( Wes Anderson), the dude has a cult following.  	1

I used to pluck them but then my hormones got really messed up and now I have to shave in addition to taking birth control and spironolactone since I have an excess of testosterone.

Generally people leave a bunch of broken furniture and garbage and we're supposed to CHARGE THEM a cleaning/dumpster fee, but my idiot co-workers usually move them out of the rooms without actually checking to see if there are NINE mattresses in there (yes this actually happened) and I am a girl so I managed to get like 5 mattresses out by myself before I threw out my back and had to get two of the guys to get the rest of them.   figure out how to use your damned debit/credit cards   yes they are truly digging to the bottom of the barrel   well obviously rabid albino squirrels.   then again the whole kissing thing was creepier and giving off an incest kind of vibe    I thought he saw her as a daughter figure.

Vitamins and my uv light help.   I have seasonal affective disorder, it's very bleak in winter and I get horribly depressed. It's finally spring so I have been sunning myself in moderation with adequate sunscreen on. In the winter months I have a UV light that helps, especially when it's dark out when I go to work and dark when I come back home, sometimes it feels like I never see the sun. I live in Pennsylvania but ideally would prefer to live in Florida or the southwest where it is usually 60 degrees year round.   Also I would have to go outside to use the ecig anyway because our district manager made it clear we were NOT allowed to vape in the store so it was just easier to go bum a cigarette.  There are many cities making it illegal so you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.   I tried e-cigs for 6 months. I quit smoking and it was awesome but then I got a job and didn't have time to sit around waiting for batteries to charge and everyone at work smoked so I went back to smoking, for almost a year now.    Did he have surgery? Poor fella.   Just wanted to add I had a bunch of tiny fibroids, not one large cyst removed. Not nearly as satisfying, they just lasered them out.

 The NI ban is heading for a [Judicial Review](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/26/northern-ireland-gay-marriage-ban-first-uk-civil-partners-win-judicial-review) so I imagine it will end up happening the same way as it did in the US.   The last assembly vote was 47/49 against with four SDLP members failing to vote despite the whip. After the Irish referendum minds will have been changed - as I said its a question of when not if.   Aside from Keke Rosberg (far from mediocre) who won only because the other contenders died racing, can you point me to these mediocre drivers that have won the WDC?   Looking through [the list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_World_Drivers'_Champions) I can't see a single one.   Edit: Pironi was appallingly injured, Villeneuve died.   The most dominant car/driver combos in F1 history (in order of percentage of victories in a season). Your point stands as this only looks at car/driver rather than teams - but its interesting non-the-less:-  - Ascari's 1953 Ferrari 500 (75%);   - Schumacher's 2004 F2004 (72%);   - Jim Clark's 1963 Lotus 25 (70%);  - Vettel's 2013 RB9 (68%);  - Fangio's 1954 Maserati 250F A6GCM (66%);  - Schumacher's 2002 F2002 (64%);  - Jim Clark's 1965 Lotus 33 (60%);  - Vettel's 2011 RB7 and Hamilton's 2014 W05 (57.89%);  - Fangio's 1955 Mercedes W196 (57.18%).       They have had several close votes in parliament, but the executive has decided not to press ahead with legislation, mainly because they really do have much [bigger problems](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/02/northern-ireland-crisis-talks-fail-resolve-stand-off-welfare-reforms) to deal with at the moment. But there is a majority in the assembly for same-sex marriage so it isn't a question of if, but when.   If you want split hairs about the status in the UK then have your claim, its wrong, and all but a small amount of the population have access to same sex marriage, but there you go.      It didn't. We've had civil partnerships nationwide since 2004, same sex marriage in England and Wales since 2013, Scotland and the Pitcairn Islands since 2014. The only laggard is Northern Ireland where same sex marriages in performed in the rest of the UK are treated as Civil Partnerships.  Also notable that it didn't take the UK Supreme Court to decide the issue, our democracy (mostly) did its job.   I didn't realise it was them - I could never get a good enough look at the logo without attracting unwanted attention. Have they rebranded?         No. The type of leaflets and magazines they hand out are.  There are so many people involved, and the quality of the leaflets is quite high, I've been wondering where the funding is coming from.   Is it me or does there seem to be some kind of Christian Fundamentalists outside every London train station during rush hour?   The two who stand outside my local station sing (not very well) - not the most conducive addition to the morning commute               People simply aren't that original. Examine any online password dump and you'll discover that much.   Personally I see this tension as the core of the issue.   There are groups that want to view marriage as a purely religious construct and therefore their rejection of LGBQT marriage or anything associated with it is a matter of personal freedom of choice and therefore protected - but that simply isn't the case and it hasn't been for a very long time because of the depth of legal status of marriage in national and international law.   Attempting to limit access to marriage denies fundamental freedoms to LGBQT people - freedoms so fundamental that most people barely think of them or realise that they're even there until they don't have them.  Ultimately everyone is free to accept or reject LGBQT marriage in their personal lives, but they don't' have the right to impose their beliefs on other people in society and thereby limit other's freedoms for no good reason.   Why wouldn't a baker, for example, that doesn't wish to service LGBQT couples simply put a sign in their shop window to that effect? This would save everyone embarrassment! The reason is that they know that such a sign would hurt their business even among the straight community - in other words they *know* that there is a difference between their personal beliefs and the functionality of their work.  On the company issue, I don't have a problem with your position and I don't think it's bigoted, but I do think it's unrealistic. Can we really live in a society where the personal religious views of a company's CEO affect *your* partner's ability to receive part of *your* pension should you die? Equally if that is the standard then why couldn't a company turn around and refuse to pay survivor benefits to anyone regardless of their sexuality - these things cut both ways.    Your MP is someone who will steadily sacrifice all individual rights in an effort to defeat invincible encryption.  This is cynicism. You failed to even attempt to understand this person's perfectly reasonable position and dismissed it out of hand. I don't agree with her position, but I at least recognise it as accurate from a statist standpoint.  I say this as a 20 year IT veteran. *There is no privacy* the idea that there was at some stage some kind of privacy in our lives was a construct based on security by obscurity i.e. government and private enterprise was in possession of much data in paper or quasi-digital form but lacked the tools to centralise, regurgitate and mine the data in a meaningful way - obviously that has changed significantly.  Recently a security firm went out in Victoria Street in London and asked people for their passwords and email addresses in return for a free coffee or a chocolate bar - 78% of respondents provided those details - that is how little people care about their own privacy, security, and that of their employer.      Is there a real need to be cynical about her response? While I don't agree with what she has to say her position is reasonable and any party in power, or with designs on power, would hold exactly that position given the security briefings they receive and the diffuse nature of the threat.               Its a very big thing indeed - its all very well for people to argue that marriage is a religious status alone but that simply isn't the case in modern society - so many of our legal systems and international laws are built on conveying rights via the simple term 'marriage' that those without the ability to marry are quickly deprived of basic rights by simply stepping over an international border.  Survivor benefits could indeed be conveyed by contracts but there are a couple of big problems with that. Firstly it's within the discretion of the company - Apple will pay out, Hobby Lobby won't. Secondly when it comes to insurance its a matter of the legal term - legally they're only required to recognise the status of certain relationships and without a change in the law that doesn't happen because it would increase costs - this leads to LGBQT people paying more for certain kinds of insurance and having to have specially drawn up wills etcetera.     Yes to the former. The term 'marriage' is codified into so many international laws, treaties and intra-legal system recognition agreements that LGBQT couples literally need to be in something called a 'marriage' to obtain basic rights when travelling or moving overseas.  To be clear a same-sex couple with a civil partnership conducted in the UK could not emigrate to Canada as a married couple because the UK law isn't recognised there. If the same couple were travelling in Canada and were in a serious accident the partners would be unable to make medical decisions for one and other, and in some cases their family (if they disapprove of the marriage) may seek to prevent one from even seeing the other (sadly this has happened).  Re:survivor benefits - if your marriage isn't recognised you wouldn't be able to obtain life insurance payouts, death benefits from an employer, pension payouts etc. This leaves the surviving partners in a very tricky financial position.               I think 'came out in favor' is a bit strong, they punted - hemming and hawing, until it was clear which way the wind was blowing. Nikki Haley showed more leadership than every single one of them put together!   Have to say its also very convenient for everyone that the zeitgeist was about the flag and not the dead bodies or racist militias.   I'm aware of the irony but on level I'd rather pay into a system I do believe in even if it is, relatively speaking, expensive. I get far more value out of R4 alone than 12 quid a month could buy elsewhere.   Personally I only pay the licence fee for Radio 4 as I don't watch TV at all anymore.   I'd happily pay a separate licence fee just for radio.   Done.   The flip-flopping on the flag issue was so huge that you could hear the floundering splashes of the GOP candidates from England!  I agree on the marriage issue but punting it to the states is the classic get out clause. In world where married persons need their marriage to be legal and valid when they cross international borders and partner benefits can mean survival is that Libertarian position tenable?   If anyone is able to identify the buttons and controls visible I would be very grateful. /r/formula1/ also wonders if that is an early sequential shift or manual 'H' configuration with the gate removed for fast shifting.      It is. But...  Here in the UK Churchill (a lion of the right wing) didn't consider the NHS or Welfare State Socialist, and wrote as much. That's not a position that a modern Conservative in England would recognise. Our right has drifted further right in some policy areas to the point that in policy terms, thanks to inertia, there is no recognisably left or centrist party - I'm beginning to wonder if left/right is even a useful distinction.  In the US the GOP has gone *so* far right/authoritarian that it's practically a fringe party - but the Democrats are, as a function of that drift, being pulled further right in order to hold their electoral coalition together. So Obama's Democratic party are essentially occupying the same economic space as Reagan albeit with a much more liberal view of society and individual freedoms.  I don't know if this is a good or a bad thing to be honest with you.    galvanise them like crazy  Wild ride for sure, but these decisions combined with the confederate flag issue just force almost all the GOP candidates into the ideologically pure far/fringe right.  I can't see a GOP candidate being taken seriously in the general with any of the positions these guys are taking.   I'm curious why the liberal side of the court limit the ramifications of their decisions this way. Is there a strategy to the method i.e. they are doing it to satisfy a particular justice's preference, or limiting the usefulness of the president in future cases?   Big win! With the distribution of subsidies in the tax code any future president could have wrecked the law easily. Thanks to this decision, which specifically says the tax rule was not required, the Republicans are completely done and cooked - they can't attack the law even if they win the presidency.   Oil / brake fluid maybe?  I imagine it must have been pretty hot in there!      Renault takes a stake, perhaps the 25% it sold recently, the team work through the Mercedes contract and take the Renault PU when its ready.   Ok, show me the evidence in token spending rate that the problem is actually the freeze (this year there is no freeze) The teams are free to spend their tokens as they like right now, yet they are not doing so...   - Its a democratically accountable team led sport and has been since Red Bull broke up FOTA.  - The role you've outlined for FOM is exactly what it does already.   - The role you've outlined for FIA is exactly what it does already.  - The sport tried the arrangement you're suggesting and it was a disaster.  The only problem F1 has is that the teams cannot work together and can't agree on anything - and that has been the case since 1950.  F1 really only works when the FIA and FOM are aligned - Bernie then brings the teams together by fair means or fowl.      Mercedes made an offer of a deal on the 5th engine, the other teams did not agree with the terms, and therefore Mercedes would not vote for a fifth engine. *This is how governance by committee works*.  We had a FISA dictatorship, that lead to the foundation of FOCA and the FOCA/FISA war, the formation of the FIA, and that is what propelled Bernie into the position he holds today.      The strategy group **is** composed of the teams, FOM, and the FIA.   All that notwithstanding the 'golden eras' of F1 that the fans in this sub seem to lionise are all eras when F1 was a dictatorship.      Its the same every time the engine formula changes, it just takes a while for everyone to catch up, and we had great racing last year in any case.   Everyone is complaining about the engine regs, but, looking at the rate of token spend, the problems Renault and Honda have are way more fundamental than even unlimited development could fix. They can't make the systems they have work.  Also F1 is a business as are the teams. From Mercedes perspective they've invested four years and close to a billion dollars on that car - how is it then fair to ask them to basically cease their development and allow the other teams to catch up?   I don't think that, given the circumstances, this was an option. Whatever actually happened it was clear that trust had evaporated between Alonso and the team. Equally, with Kimi, it wasn't clear that his driving was a real problem for the team last year given the dog of a car they had produced for him.   If you look at Austria even the Mercs couldn't follow each other such is the dirty air pouring off the car 2 seconds in front. I agree with much of what you say but I think the front wing changes between 2014 - 2015 haven't helped the racing, and therefore engines are not the only problem.   Ultimately its a business decision - Raikkonen's performance issues have dragged the team's media coverage into negative territory for two season's straight - drowning out positive coverage of Ferrari's nascent improvement this year and becoming constant distraction for the team.  I say this as a huge Kimi fan who thinks he should have been a three time WDC winner. Kimi is a serious problem for Ferrari. He isn't delivering on track and he's not promoting the team well either - his 'fuck you' approach to media was refreshing when he was delivering in races, now it just looks foolish and unengaged.  Ferrari could get a more consistent driver which would do more for their image and performance elsewhere very easily. Bottas appears to be the obvious choice, IMO it should be Hulkenberg or Ricciardo, but at this point any of them would be better than the present situation (Sadly. Very sadly in fact.)   What the Police 'know' and what they can prove to a sufficient degree to make the information public are two very separate things.  Making the information public also makes the suspects scarper quickly.   I'd contact your local MP and cc their parliment.uk email on any email communication/complaint with the police. Letters with the portcullis logo on or emails that CC parliamentary addresses tend to focus minds.  Also find out the name of the chief constable and then contact them directly via email cc'ing your MP, the format is usually firstname.surname@domain.name (minus the www). Its surprisingly effective.   Yep, the barrier has been there in some form since the advent of colour copiers and printers.      But relative to wages (which are 1,418 lower in the North) the problem remains the same.   Telegraph and Mail took the same line.   No. That was Bernie's point about social media last year - the much derided Rolex comment. The point in plainer language is that engaging socially might be good for fans (and this isn't a reason why we shouldn't do it), but it can't provide the revenue or cashflow needed to operate F1.  Race fees and TV rights make up (50/50) $1.3 billion of F1's 1.6 billion revenue $1 billion of which is distributed to the teams. No amount of advertising or sponsorship on youtube or another streaming model will replace that kind of revenue.   Don't forget that the value of those TV rights is 50% of the prize fund that the teams rely on for a large chunk of their income.            In terms of HGV's, buses and coaches we actually already do upgrade the safety features - the regime being implemented for HMO's is actually built on the same framework.        Not quite - HMO standards are about implementing basic personal safety standards in housing, just as crash standards for vehicles are about implementing basic personal safety standards in cars.     I get the point, but applying the argument you're making to cars would suggest that mandating crash standards for vehicles is a bad thing because it increases their price.         Totally agree!   Mainly to stop negligent landlords from killing people - which happens all too frequently even in this country.   I very much doubt that you have any experience or knowledge in the sector given the crass nature of your remarks and total ignorance of the law as it pertains to contracts and housing.   What I said was that statutory protections for *tenants* would be a good place to start. Statutory Government safety standards for types of rented accommodation are *not* protection *of* tenants *from* landlords any more than the British Standards Kite Mark is protection of the consumer from harm - they concern quality standards and/or safety of product, not individual rights in a dispute.   The only way a tenant can fight a non-financial, eviction, or semi-financial dispute with a landlord is in the civil courts (you would know this if you knew what you were talking about). I really don't know why the SCC is so important to you - it offers a service to landlords for rent arrears and has little use for tenants.  Anyway this isn't a discussion, you're completely wrong in what you had to say, and saying it with crass embellishments just makes you sound dumb.    HMO works are a result of changing government standards which are enforced locally by the council.   Actually both the government and the councils are victims of increasing house prices and private sector rents as they have to fund the housing of the poor.   Umm, no. I can see you have absolutely no experience of such matters and a poor attitude - 'hand holding' - really? What an ignorant thing to say.  There are standards for HMO's, which in *some* areas have to be licenced and inspected prior to letting, and there are standards for private rented accommodation which *should* be observed but these are *not* statutory protections for the tenant with criminal penalties attached - they concern the council's relationship with the landlord alone and the enforcement is exclusively civil.   A tenant can complain and environmental health might turn up in 6 months and issue a letter to a private landlord requesting changes and threatening legal action if they don't undertake the prescribed work, but enforcement only takes place for serious multiple breaches and its a ponderous process. This does not affect the contractual relationship between landlord and tenant - it most certainly does not overrule the contract in the slightest which is an entirely separate legal document dealt with mainly by the county courts.  As to the small claims court you cannot take landlord/tenant (act) disputes to it, as it deals with money alone. You can pursue debts that way so it's of little use to tenants but very popular with landlords.   Not at all, if you know a little of computers and cars, the article is completely correct. It's distressingly easy to hack into cars - it has been for decades - and the problem is only getting worse.   Actual statutory rights for tenants (contracts are only worth the opposite parties ability to prosecute the contract in civil court), and a legal service that resolves landlord/ tenant disputes without dragging them through the county courts for years at massive expense to both parties would be a good start.  Protection from predatory landlords and letting agents, working environmental health services - the list is endless.    I think you can take that view if you wish but [experts in the sector disagree](http://www.propertyreporter.co.uk/property/could-tackling-multiple-home-ownership-assist-housing-crisis.html). In reality multiple home ownership isn't a symptom at all but one of a number of primary causes - lack of house building is another - all of which need intensive action.  We cant keep building to accommodate demand, land is in short supply, particularly in locations where people most want to live. In reality, there is plenty of property, but with some investors owning numerous buy-to-let properties, prices continue to rise making it impossible for first-time buyers to pull together enough deposit to make that first step. (Michael Riley, a former Head of Sales for Savills and Head of Operations for Romans in the Thames Valley)   That would be Bangladesh. We are [53rd in the world](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_density) by population density.      The idea itself is not so fanciful, its basically what we do with a large number of shared ownership properties in the social housing sector - short term tenancies are a disaster for many in generation rent, disrupt social cohesion, and a fix for that problem is badly needed.  And in fact he does get it. There is a housing crisis in this country - private let landlords have benefited and continue to benefit from [14 Billion in tax breaks](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/26/landlords-14bn-tax-breaks-buy-to-let-expansion-mortgage-interest) - they are a group that has grossly profited from their own shrinking of the housing stock which by turns pushed up house prices whilst pushing locals out.  Personally I'd much rather listen to some radical ideas on the topic than the baleful ignorance of Cameron and co whilst they plunder the working poor and disabled.                                       Fully paid is a bit of a stretch - there are bursaries available but most nurses don't get anything like their full ride paid for.   Presently we do train  20k nurses a year, but you're correct retention is a major issue and to be completely honest no one brings their kids up to tolerate the conditions in the health service.      You could argue the same thing about any trained profession but, as you say, retention is a huge problem within the NHS because (having half a dozen nurses in the family) many trusts treat nurses extremely poorly, pay is relatively low, and conditions can be dreadful. There is little flexibility so nurses like my sister, despite having the PhD level highly specialised qualifications required for top end intensive care nursing, end up in 9 - 5 desk jobs because the trusts can't think of a better way to handle her having a family.  All that said its also true, from a UK economic perspective, that people who receive degree level training earn far more through their lifetimes than people with lower skills qualifications and contribute more to the economy. So it actually doesn't matter if they stay in the profession the country still benefits economically.  Non degree average starting salaries are  17k compared to  31k for those with a degree.   If you think what they're doing in this area of policy is bad you should see the utter balls up Grayling is making of the criminal justice system!  I was hugely disappointed that there was no examination of the coalition's record in government during the election. Health is a mess, immigration, environment, education and criminal justice are very unfunny jokes.   There were 20k nursing places last year and over 50k applicants - we have plenty of people who want to be nurses we just don't have the commitment to education needed to train them because its expensive.  In the meantime a temporary solution to fill the skills gap has become the norm.               I wouldn't call it poor at all but it can be a little simplistic.         Bernie doesn't own the rights to stream anything, streaming licensing is organised at national broadcaster level e.g. Sky in the UK, RTL in Germany etcetera.  This is why a global streaming solution isn't happening. If FOM wanted to do this they would have to amend the terms of every existing F1 broadcaster contract and/or pay the broadcasters for the privilege of streaming their own race. Even that would only solve half the problem. FOM provides the TV pictures as part of their licensing agreement but it's the broadcasters that own the IP for the commentary and the would have to be paid for that.  50% of the prize fund that the teams get comes to F1 via broadcast rights, so you would also have to be careful not to hurt the teams financially when making the deals to put a streaming solution together.  TL;DR Streaming F1 races has nothing to do with Bernie or FOM because of the way the broadcast licences are organised.   Car hit a crowd gathered for an F1 event - many killed sadly.   Are his comments on German TV much different than in English? I've always wondered how much not speaking their native language affects what people like Lauda, Alonso and Massa have to say and how they come across in interviews.  Seb's generation obviously grew up speaking English from a young age and his command is amazing - he has colloquialisms, understands and uses sarcasm, tone, inflection etcetera - many other drivers don't seem to have as much depth. With Massa especially I often wonder how much we're missing of what he's really thinking.  *This isn't intended as criticism of anyones English - just an observation.*   I love that he's willing to get in the mix be positive and back people, too many of the older drivers seem to spend their time being negative about the current era and questioning if the drivers are any good.   I was honestly amazed no one else had posted it!  Thanks due to Ernie Black the F1 poet https://twitter.com/TheF1Poet/status/612249373511143424         Basically the safest most conservative strategy that would get the to the end of the race with the maximum result. In essence no stops and as little overtaking as possible with all the work done in quali.  That's really the problem and the reason we have to mix up the rules all the time - to increase the challenge and disrupt the team's data models.   All empires do - its simple inertia.    I completely see your point, but if there was such a point they would have found it already, we're about where we're going to get with degrading tyres. The real problem is dirty air.   Sure it is, but you saw the consequences of too conservative tyre choices in Canada - 1 stop races and long stints.   I don't disagree, but that is the way the sport has always been. Fangio's trick was winning at the slowest possible speed.   Moreover that's not the debate we have i.e. the debate in this sub and among fans is frequently utterly uneducated. All of the things I listed above are allegedly ruining the sport - only that wasn't the case in the 80s or 00s.  The only difference is people are more aware of what the drivers are actually doing.   The News summed up: 'Good Morning, here is a list of reasons why it isn't.'   You're going to need to explain that one!      Yet the sport has been there before and it was profoundly dull! There has never been an era in F1 where drivers were on the limit every lap.   Many fans claim the 80s and 00s were golden eras of F1 yet these are periods where tyre and fuel management really was to the fore, third placed drivers were often lapped, a small number of drivers won everything in sight, and the organisation of the sport really was a bi-dictatorship between Bernie and Mosely.  The more people know about what's happening the less happy they seem to be.    Some have run the power deficit numbers and say that the chassis is as good as Ferrari's.          Even Schumacher didn't care about the records, the top drivers really don't - they just love the racing.   When you look at her actual complaints it's quickly clear that the BBC were simply ahead of their time with reporting standards and language control - all of these things can be found in every modern news broadcast.   Eurosceptics have been conducting a public campaign against EU membership since 1992, arguing that they haven't had enough time to make their case is ludicrous.                           This is presumably why the No camp wanted a separate date from the other elections going on in May next year.    In this case we have [tracking data going back to the late 70's](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/11617702/poll.html) to back it up.   Whilst I agree, by the standard you're applying Cameron wanted the Scots to leave the UK.   Cameron wanted a straight up or down vote, Labour wanted DevoMax put to a vote, Salmond wanted the out campaign to be 'Yes' and the date. It turned out to be a very profitable deal for Cameron and Salmond.         Yes.                  Its a pity its yet another proboscis - the Mercedes nose looks far smarter.   Because they're human beings.   The people who come first on any housing list are those whose need is most urgent - homeless people's need for shelter is vastly more important than my desire to buy a home.   I have a roof over my head and a warm bed to sleep in, I certainly wouldn't take up any scheme built on the backs of people less fortunate than myself no matter their nationality.   Couple of things. For one many EU nationals that end up homeless in London are actually working homeless, they're just too poorly paid to afford housing even 'sheds with beds'. This is symptom of the housing crisis and there is plenty a Mayor of London can do about that.  For another many mayors when facing similar problems create repatriation schemes or stage advertising campaigns in other countries to dissuade people from coming to begin with.   I've (and many others) have said it time and again - the benefits to 'ordinary' working class people for free movement of people and more generally an open immigration policy NEEDS to be made.  I think most people especially in this sub, from the way 'ordinary working class' is routinely used, think of the working class as those engaged in un/semi skilled manual or industrial work and forget completely about the working poor. The definition is in fact those without the ability to live on accumulated capital. That includes increasing amounts people especially with the continuing housing crisis and the piles of student debt being accrued. You've got to throw down 5,000 to get a HGV licence these days on top of 2k to learn to drive a car - a near impossibility for many people at 18 no matter if you're working or middle class.  As far a the benefits of freedom of movement go for 'working class' people go, you have to be in a position to move to realise them.  Care workers, oil rig workers, IT workers and the like are all part of the modern working class can, and have, realised benefits by moving overseas where they are better paid or gain better quality of life - but the reality is that if you're on an hourly waged shift work job in a factory in Northampton freedom of movement is only going to put your wages under pressure. The only way to change that is to educate better and ensure access to education and skills training is freely available to all.           75% of the welfare bill is pensions, much of the rest is working tax credits which fill in for employers who want the staff but not the bill.   Employment benefits are not the problem and never have been (but they are an easy target) - Tory's like to forget this when making an argument about how undeserving the recipients of these benefits are - universal credit will only make the situation less transparent.      Indeed. But many UKIP supporters claim that the party is funded by its membership and that it is an anti-establishment party. Nothing could be further from the truth.   Nico was done psychologically after Spa last year - any time Hamilton can put him under pressure he cracks like an egg.   As you say, it's mostly based on sentiment rather than actual information and a lot of that is media desperation for heroes and villains style stories driven by near complete lack of facts or context.  The good stuff about Europe - the fact that its the only consumer regulatory force in the UK and the only force dealing with anti-trust, appliance energy ratings, tyre ratings, limiting the power of credit card companies, crash standards, road safety almost never gets any kind of coverage - very few even notice it actually comes from the EU.      It [isn't](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/11617702/poll.html) thats a claim based on one recent poll, and looking at 30 years of tracking data shows it to be a foolish claim.   Exactly right - it has been on the BBC London news though. It'll only make the national news if it's very big and something significant happens.  That said they allegedlly ignored [this protest last year](https://tompride.wordpress.com/2014/06/21/bbc-and-press-ignore-massive-demonstration-against-austerity-in-london/), only [they didn't](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-27962963) at all. In fact that march was also reported in the Guardian, Telegraph, and the Independent.  People on the right and the left always claim the BBC is biased against them, if they can't show intentional bias, then its biased by failure to report, or failure to give the story or story angle they see as important enough attention.  IMO it's mostly the bias of the person complaining showing, not the BBC.      Its the classic Es*sex* *Anal*ytics problem - filtering is hard. Trying to filter the web is a fools game.   Interestingly both Carswell and Hannan were born overseas, both spent most of their childhoods overseas, and both have one Scots parent.      - UKIP received 4,376,635 votes at the Euro Elections in 2014, a national scale election, but received 3,881,099 at the general election - a *loss* of 495,536 voters.  - In Thanet Farage received 16,026 votes, Thanet North and Thanet South together cast 28,123 votes for UKIP, but virtually the same area elected a UKIP council with 54,230 votes.  - UKIP was polling at 17% in January but only received 12.6% of the vote.  - UKIP didn't get a poll bounce from the leaders debate, and actually dropped in the polls immediately after the challengers debate.  - UKIP performed poorly in all 12 of its top target seats and was beaten into *third* by Labour in half of them.  - It actually *lost* vote share in four target seats based on its 2010 and 2014 performances: South Basildon and East Thurrock -4.43%, Croydon Central -24.45%, Rochester   Strood -11.6%, Clacton -15.3%  In other words Farage isn't nearly as good of a campaigner as people think, and the major UKIP donor Stuart Wheeler (who paid for the campaign) was correct when he described the election as "a failure". This is the reason why there was a leadership coup following Farage's un-resignation.   It doesn't need Farage to polarize it and looking at a list of UKIP donors the party is basically paid for by *The Establishment**.   Just look at yesterday's shenanigans in the House of Commons. Basically the Eurosceptics can't even agree on the rules amongst themselves let alone with anyone else. We have two years of this nonsense to look forward to and the public are already exhausted by the clap trap spewing forth over the issue.  * UKIPs main donors 2001 - 2013 (total, of which less than two million came from other sources, 9,554,314): Paul Sykes, Stuart Wheeler, Julian Blackwell, Sir John Craven, Lord Neidpath, Viscount Michael Cowdray, Lady Yvonne Vinson, Lady Yvonne Collin, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, Clare Barbour, John Malcolm Richards, Christopher Mills, Robin Birley, Crispin Odey, and Andy Brough. This is basically a list of bankers, brokers and the landed gentry - all of whom are seeking UKIP Peerages.                  This is how you advertise you're available in F1!         Hahahaha!  The lengths Kippers will go to in denying the facts never cease to amaze.  Its almost like you haven't read the news or followed whats happening in the party.   You've had the proof, you just can't acknowledge it.   You were done and cooked halfway through the argument - you haven't had a leg to stand on throughout.   Give up mate, it wasn't a misquote and you well know it.   The man is a former Express journalist and the party's communications director - he knew *exactly* what he was doing. The quotes were given in a deliberate interview which included similar attacks from a number of senior UKIP members.  Its very sad that you've allow yourself to become this deluded.   At this point in the discussion its up to you to demonstrate I'm wrong about O'Flynn and since I was right about his comments you can't do that so now you're simply denying reality.  You can't accept that the election result was actually a failure for UKIP.      Aww what a desperately cute effort. None of the argument I've made rests on the Farage / O'Flynn relationship.  Attempting to suggest that UKIP's GE Campaign Director, MEP, and Director of Communications, a former journalist has no relationship, or hasn't previously been supportive of the party leader is simply ludicrous.    Oh dear oh dear, is that the best you can do? What a pity.   What an utterly laughable claim you've made there. The man resigned over the attack!  I know kippers tend towards an alternate reality, but this is beyond the pale.   O'flynn said:- [Farage] Had become a "snarling, thin-skinned, aggressive man"  He went on to say  "The team around Nigel himself need to reflect why it was that Thanet voted in a Ukip council but didnt vote in Nigel as the MP for Thanet South."  Similar attacks were made over the leadership un-resignation and GE results by Diane James, Suzanne Evans, Stuart Wheeler and Paul Nuttall.  It is you who don't have your facts straight, and have a somewhat rosy view of the election result.         I think you need to read the article and the quote. Wheeler described the campaign as "a failure" in an interview, which I've linked to, in The Times immediately after the election. Patrick OFlynn launched an extraordinary personal attack on Farage at the same time - both over the poor execution of the campaign. Pretending this didn't happen or that Wheeler or O'Flynn don't fit the description of a senior members of UKIP is simply ridiculous.  We're taking the GE as a baseline for two reasons firstly its a comparable national scale election, secondly just about every UKIP shipper on this sub has claimed that the Euro elections were a predictor of UKIP's performance in the GE - they're right.   Labour's performance in the EU election made it look much more competitive in the GE than was the case. The only pluses from the Labour perspective is that it took every Lab/Con marginal, and the 7 most marginal Tory seats were decided collectively by 900 votes. The very most marginal seat went blue by only 47 votes! The next 20 most marginal seats were collectively decided by less than 10,000 votes. That means the Tories are highly vulnerable - Labour or the LibDems could easily call a by-election in a marginal they hold at the right time and sell it as a referendum on Cameron's leadership.  The whole GE was a great deal closer to a coalition than it looked.   Stuart Wheeler is a *very* senior member of the party, one of its longest members, and its largest donor - the UKIP equivalent of Lord Ashcroft. Patrick OFlynn was your campaign director - there are no two people in the party more senior save for Farage himself.  You're under the impression I'm criticising the party or its platform - in actual fact i'm offering an analysis of the result from an electoral standpoint - whine about the electoral system if it makes you feel better but the system we have is the system we have and UKIP must play that game.   The purpose of an election campaign is to convince voters to vote for you taking the euro election as a baseline UKIP actually lost votes, seats, and saw a 5% drop in national support.   Bluster all you want but it is the truth - Farage screwed the pooch.   Well, obviously you won't accept any criticism of what you perceive to be a major victory and confirmation that your position is well supported and valid. But the electoral truth is somewhat different, UKIP could have scored up to 10 seats, should have in fact looking at the tabs on the exit polls. There were back channel discussions with the Tories on this basis alone.  UKIP left the election red-faced and more importantly powerless.  But when one of your [party's major donors levels](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4440215.ece) an accusation like that at the leader's closest aide and calls for Farage to [face a leadership election](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/14/nigel-farage-facing-a-coup-over-ukip-leadership) because he fluffed the campaign, you would do better to listen rather than reject out of hand.  Edit: The paywalled Times interview above is the one in which Wheeler called the campaign a failure. Wheeler has donated close to 1 million to UKIP meaning he is solely responsible for 1/7th of the party's income since 2012.   Kassams detractors accused him of being a divisive Iago-type figure, dripping rightwing poison into Farages ear that harmed the partys chances of winning over moderate voters.  The accusation inside the party mostly exposed in the leadership contra temps post election was that Kassam pushed Farage too far to the right because he wanted a Tea Party Style campaign and this is what cost them the votes they needed to win seats.  Its been very easy for party supporters to blame the electoral system and focus on the national vote (UKIP after all loves grievance), but when you look at UKIP's performance during the campaign there is no doubt that the campaign cost UKIP votes - the polls show that.  UKIP lost a seat it had and should have won, failed in 9 other seats, lost 600k voters who were willing to vote UKIP (the hardest part is getting people to change their vote), and Carswell having received 59% of the vote in 2014 was elected with only 44%.  Thats the internal discussion inside the party - not the national performance, because the national performance doesn't matter in FPTP.   Indeed. I was mostly thinking back to the days when I lived on the Gorgie Road near Tynecastle stadium. Behaviour outside the grounds hasn't improved much though.  	197
 I probably won't get away with a pub crawl or sword, but I'll definitely try to do the Cochinillo!    Would some local sports team stuff work?    What kind of snacks would be appropriate for the plane? How much can I take on? They haven't told us if we would have any stops or if it would be one long flight.    Does this require a certain type of board? It looks like a higher flexibility would be ideal.    We're going to be in various cities for 12 days. The list says were visiting Madrid, Salamanca, Avila, Segovia, Toledo, Sevilla, Granada, and Barcelona. I think there's a couple other cities along with some free time trips where we can choose where to go.    In April I'll be going to Spain (and Europe in general) for my first time. This will also be my first time traveling out of the country. I'm going with school, so I'm a bit restricted on things I can bring and do. What would you recommend for things I bring for the plane and for the trip overall? We're staying with host families and hotels, and it's recommended we bring a gift for our hosts. What would you recommend as a gift? I've heard peanut butter is a good option, but I feel like a lot of students will be doing that. Any help is appreciated, as I know nothing about traveling.   Also, do they have kinder surprise in Spain? I love them but the US has a problem with them.   Edit: I'm going with my Spanish class, so language books are taken care of, but I will be looking into guide books!    Subway (sandwiches, not trains).   -This rule goes in general for most cashiers, most likely. If I've already rung in your order and am getting your change, please don't dig in your pockets and say "oh, I have 48!" The register just told me what to give you and it's in my hand, I'm not calculating your new change when there's a line. Keep your 48.   -Please don't shove your notebook or phone with a list of orders at me. I can't hold your grubby phone while making subs, and I know you can read. I don't mind if you come in with a list (I recommend this over a phone call!), but I can't touch it and i don't want to drop your stuff in the lettuce.   -We don't have $5 footlongs anymore. No, I can't change the prices on your order because you didn't know. Please stop yelling at me; I didn't make the price change.   -If you have a coupon, ask about it ahead of time. Like before you order. Nobody reads the coupons. Regular subs only. That doesn't mean a sub on regular bread. We're more than happy to help you with the menu-the new design is weird.   TL;DR: don't change your payment when I'm giving you your change, and read the menu and your coupons ahead of time      I'll definitely be starting with a conventional grip, then. The girls on my team that have a finger tip drill are on varsity, so I can always get the ball re drilled when I get to that point, right?    I'm serious; I know it's kinda ridiculous. I have dumb fears for every new sport I take up.   Are the rubber inserts necessary? All custom balls I've seen have them, but they look like an add on.    So I'm looking to get my first ball and have an idea of what to get. The problem is the holes. I've only bowled with house balls, but I've tried a couple of my teammates' balls and the finger holes just seem so small. And the rubber doesn't help. I don't want my fingers to get stuck while using it, and I don't want to dislocate my thumb after lofting it halfway down the lane. Anybody in the same boat at some point?    Blow outs are my biggest reason for going slow. And my ears are pretty thin and inelastic. Of course all of my friends who don't want to stretch have gorgeous lobes.    2g! Long journey, but I'll get there!   I was riding it the "wrong" way. I was using the tail as the nose. I'm glad I didn't mess anything up with my base. I'm also glad my bindings are an easy fix. Youtube will definitely be cheaper than a trip to the shop!    So my board has some problems. I told the guys at my shop that I was goofy, but I learned I'm regular. This happened because I was riding a plastic board from good will, so I sucked goofy and regular and picked one when I got a good board. I've been riding my board backwards. Is this a problem? I've seen it a couple times in videos, but I did it for pretty much a full season.   Then there's the problem of my board sat in a closet all last season. Was this bad? It didn't go into it with an end of season wax or anything; Id only gotten it waxed once on the first season.   My bindings are backwards. So, I'm assuming my stomp pad is now in the wrong spot and my safety strap thing is on the wrong foot. How do I fix all of this?   Third, and probably my biggest problem is my base. It doesn't look too happy. It has a couple scratches, which are probably okay. But I think it has base burn. http://imgur.com/a/3faxR  I scratched at it a bit in a small spot and it came off, so does it just need a good cleaning and waxing? I didn't know too much when I first got this board, so I wasn't too nice to it. I know a couple chips and scrapes are going to happen, but I don't want my base messed up this soon.   It's a 5150 Velour, but the bindings are 5150 Empress. I've never done my own wax job before, so I don't have an iron or anything. My shop charges $50 for the tune up and $20 to fiddle with bindings, so I'm hoping to be able to do this myself.   TL;DR: Please help me fix my board. It's backwards and burnt, and I don't know what I'm doing.    It looks around 8g, but I would recommend measuring it. 8g is about 3mm, so it shouldn't be more than .5mm off.    Although decades are increments of 10 so it doesn't work as much.    I had to start taping to make the 8-6 jump. It only took four weeks. I would do an inch of tape on the plugs every two weeks (changing the tape to keep it from getting gross every couple days). I would recommend going with PTFE and some glass wear Pyrex plugs. They're like $8 a pair on body art forms and their wearable is big enough so you don't have to trim the tape. At small sizes like 8, tape is finicky enough, so not having to trim makes it easier.    Also make sure to check local shops! They have great selection. The shop I go to is having a 40% off all jewelry sale.    That's what I was worried about. I don't quite know how placement would go or anything - Id leave that to the professional. Usually I test piercings with an old CBR to see how they look, but I don't have a spare industrial bar so I can't figure out if it would work. The only think I don't know about is if it would be able to go through the back of the forward helix comfortably.    Ah, sorry!    I've always liked the look of elf ears, but I'm not able to make the commitment to getting my ears sewn into a different shape due to not quite having a career path yet - and it's a big mod. I figured I could get sort of an illusion of elf ears with an inverted industrial. Kind of connecting an outer helix to a forward helix. Has anyone had this done? Is it even possible?    It looks a good half centimeter from where it was marked. Did he remark the placement and pierce there or just change the placement mid-piercing?    I'll have to try a pair. I thought it was a pretty heavy stone, so the reviews on BAF that called it light threw me off a bit. And it's price isn't too bad either.    Twisting a piercing is like twisting stitches. You want to heal that wound, not agitate it. Try to find an APP piercer, or one that had least taken some APP classes. I know not everyone has one locally, but it's worth a bit of a drive. This is a hole in your body. You don't want just anyone putting it there. I have some local piercers, but they're terrible so I waited until I could take an hour drive to an APP one. The mods here, and even many of the members would probably be able to point you in the right direction for a knowledgable piercer.    Which material have you found heaviest to wear? Not just stone vs wood, but stone vs stone and all that. I only have Quartz plugs, and they feel pretty heavy, but I don't have much to compare them to. When I get to my goal size, I want to wear heavier plugs to dead stretch a bit since some of my favorite plugs are double flare and I'll need the give. I'm not worried about price since I have time to save up, as long as it's not anatometal eyelets expensive.    I find that adjusting the water before getting in saves a lot of pain and hypothermia.    In the US, art classes tend to be only mandatory until 6th grade (age 12 or so). Leadership roles are everywhere, but students aren't pushed to innovate or create. There's a lot of pushing to take AP classes and Honors classes in favor of art. Also, arts funding is the first thing to get cut in schools. Some schools hardly have music programs.    He may have pierced her bigger than standard earrings, but not so big that she has to wear plugs. Most shops pierce at 14g for lobes, which is 2-3 sizes bigger than standard earrings. The jewelry might slide around a bit in her ears, but it should be fine. If the jewelry she has in now looks like it's about 2mm in diameter or less, she can just wear some smaller sized jewelry and downsize.    I've always had pretty thin lobes, and with stretching I've been worried about them getting thinner. I'm only going up to a 2g (at a pretty slow pace), but I'm stretching my second holes so there's less lobe to begin with. I know downsizing and going back up is a method to thicken up lobes. How effective is this? Right now my wearable is a little under 1/4 inch (going off of my earskins), so I need some help.    BAF also has great shipping rates. I think it's roughly $5 for USPS priority shipping and only $1 insurance on any order. I've never passed up the insurance yet and all of my orders come in under a week. I think they have a free shipping deal, but I don't know the rate on it.    Your lobes look great! I'm jealous!    Wasn't trying to be an ass, I was just trying to avoid the shot glass method.    I have a fresh conch piercing, so I want to avoid bumping my ear on a cup.    How exactly do you do a sea salt soak? I've seen salt:water ratios all over this subreddit but not how to do it. I've been using H2Ocean so I've been just spraying it on. I've heard of putting your lobes in a shot glass of the water, but my lobes aren't quite big enough for that. Bowl? Cotton ball? I want to make my lobes happy without spraying salt water everywhere.    I had to start taping to get up to a 6g. After 4 weeks, I was at a 6. I added an inch or so of tape every two weeks and was there in no time. My ears aren't very stretchy, so yours might tape up quicker. But make sure to take taping slow as well since you're still stretching your skin.  And keep them well oiled!    Yup. I got mine in a kit, but you could probably find some separately.    [meh.com](http://meh.com)    I always thought it was a goat with a pipe..   Where exactly do you plan on taking the laptop that you don't want the school to know about? They know your address. They know where libraries are. If you stop at McDonalds on the way home, they won't care. Chances are, the location tracking is to prevent theft and to track the Chromebook if it's lost or stolen. The tech department has more important things to worry about than looking at the whereabouts of teenagers and their school laptops. If you're worried about the thing having access to the webcam without your permission, cover it with a post it. Use it responsibly and you shouldn't have anything to worry about. It's a big investment for the school so naturally they have a lot of security measures in place. Use your own device to play around and do things you don't want your teachers to know about. If they take screenshots of you writing a paper or taking notes, then they'll just know that you're working.    Go naked over night and see how far that takes your lobes. If your lobes downsize to an 8 or so, just stick in some 10's and let your ears do their thing.    I'm getting kind of sick of wearing the same tunnels or captives in my 14g lobes. I've seen some amazing anatometal studs but I don't know how to get them. Are they just labrets or are they a custom piece?    If you don't have a gauge card, such as the freebies from BAF, you could use a caliper or a ruler to measure your tapers and match them to a gauge size chart. Some sizes will have a bit of deviation, but most are on target. In regards to neosporin, I wouldn't recommend it. Head over to walmart and pick up a bottle of vitamin e oil. Much better for stretching and much cheaper.    Ultimately, they are your parents, so their decision is what you want to go by to keep tension lo was long as they're the boss. My dad doesn't want me "gauging" at all, yet my mom doesn't care much either way. My goal size is 2g so it's easy to hide, especially at my correct 8g. I'd recommend talking to your parents and make sure to show your dad that you know the proper and safe way to stretch and be stretched and the consequences that come with stretching along with how you plan on dealing with employment (parents love to use that one). If your dad is still against it after you try to show that stretching isn't the end of the world, show cooperation and agree to downsize until you're an adult. If anything, he will see it as a sign of maturity and change his mind, especially as parents tend to see stretched ears as rebellion. Cooperation completely breaks that.   TL;DR: talk to them and cooperate with your parents. The worst that can happen is your dad doesn't budge and you have to downsize until you're an adult.    Don't just save coins. Keep low value coins (pennies for Americans, penny equivalent for those outside the US) completely separate from all the other coins. They take up a lot of space for not giving much value. Dimes are smaller than pennies and sure do cash in for more! Sorting the change is a bit tedious, but you get a lot more back at the change machine.    Too many customers answer "yes" to questions where it just doesn't work. Even worse are the ones who are staring at their phones and answer "yes" to "what kind of bread for that?"   Just waiting until the next size slides in is probably the best way to stretch! I only clean my ears with H2ocean when they're super irritated or the week after a new stretch. For taping, a common size to start is the jump from 8 to 6. I think it's the first full millimeter, so it's a bit harder for ears to adjust. However, when you start taping is completely up to your ears.    I've thought about if this could exist for convenience, but there's not much of a way this could be made with a safe material. Niobium is flexible, but their description made it should like they were trying to eliminate high cost. The closest effective thing to these would be Snap Plugs. The idea of an expanding plug is cool, but I can't think of how it would be safe.    Losing plugs sucks! I'll probably do the earskins or naked since earskins are water safe.    I'm going out to a lake in a few days and was wondering what type of plugs I should wear while swimming. I want to wear my earskins since they will float if they do pop out, but I don't know if they're okay for water.    They're nice and lightweight. I always give them a good rubdown with vitamin e before wearing them and make sure my ears are nice and oiled up. They're super comfortable to wear. I occasionally have to oil throughout the day because they do get a little dry and a little paranoia goes a long way with ears. I usually use holey buttr for that since carrying around a bottle of oil looks a bit odd. I'm definitely looking forward to more horn jewelry.    I've only bought one pair of horn hangers from Oracle, but they're amazing. They were great quality and a decent price. I have plans to save up for some pieces from One Tribe, but until then, I'll have to get a couple more from Oracle.    I find that Oracle is a quite good brand. They have some pretty reasonable prices as well, although are still on the pricey side overall. One Tribe has some great looking pieces and is pretty widely approved of as well.     Our store has a tip jar that we use to bring up the register when it's short. At the end of your shift, you count the drawer. If it's short on your shift, you fix it. I don't know if that's just us, or universal. A few cents is passable, but a dollar or more needs to be fixed. We know subway isn't a restaurant entitled to tips, so throwing that $1.06 in from the tip jar usually doesn't bother anyone. Our owner definitely doesn't mind when we keep the drawer even or above.    Veggies expire  (by subway standards) after two days, so they should never be sitting in the cooler 2 days before serving. Most veggies are prepped that day, though. Maybe a difference of a couple hours, but don't make an employee check labels because you want some fresh veggies. If you're the only one there and the employees seem like they're in a decent mood, they might slice a tomato or green pepper just for you. But don't pull that an hour before close. Chances are the back is cleaned up or close to it.    "I'll have the white cheese." Thank you. That has now narrowed it down to 4 out of 5 of our cheeses. Some continue to insist on the white one after I ask which one.    The employees control an alarm clock radio in back, broken radio in front. Usually a pop station, but sometimes I get the luck of rock or silence.    Has anyone set up a way for them to meet up yet? They would probably have some pretty interesting conversations.   I'll have to grab some next week. I knew my lobes were a bit on the thin side, but they didn't seem that thin. At least since they're clearing out they'll be nice and cheap!   I just got my first few pairs of earskins. They're amazing all around except that the wearable seems off. I got 5/16 since that seemed to be the common size and didn't seem too big. When I put them in, it seemed like they had a massive bit sticking out. In pictures I've seen of earskins, they're really close to the ear. Should I have gotten a smaller wearable or is this a common thing and I just have to keep them pushed back?    What is even happening in this thread anymore   Apparently when I was younger, I would never actively wake my parents. I would just tiptoe into their room and stare at them until their parent meter went off. Usually service was pretty slow.    Can someone tell me why we hate this?   Thanks! I couldn't tell if it was an orbital or a nicely placed conch. I was thinking of getting it for my birthday, but wanted to avoid having to pay for two piercings.    I'm thinking about finally adding to my piercings. I was thinking about getting [this](https://gs1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/8019B6/data.tumblr.com/6d8e5f3655b194ee6ce6fd889a48e600/tumblr_n5dznyV5PW1s7gqgho1_500.jpg) but I don't know if it's an orbital or a conch. I also don't know what size of captives to wear in it. It seems like it would be bigger than those you would wear in a septum diameter wise, but I'm not sure. Opinions/help from anyone with any knowledge on this piercing would be appreciated!   What is your current size? What type of tape are you using? Bondage tape and PTFE have different thicknesses, and your current size definitely matters.   I know it's too steep to ride. But it would be fun if it was rideable. It's just a massive rail that at first glance seems fun to ride.    Some subways have drive thrus, so this might be the case (not likely though). OP either visited an extremely low standard subway that barely passes inspection or OP works at subway and did it for the karma. Hell, there isn't even herbs on that herb and cheese.    I can agree with this. No subway employee is this sloppy. And there's no reason for the bread to have been mutilated as it was wrapped. Granted, the sandwiches aren't usually like the picture, but they're not horrible either.    I'll have to post there too, thanks! I couldn't find a subreddit for spots so I figured here was broad enough.       TIL I'm a guy.    So it's a real placenta? I was hoping it was just some really good latex work...   No problem :)   If you really want to see if it will look good on you for yourself, pick up a cheap captive bead ring and stick it on your nose. I did that to test septum and lip piercings. And since CBRs are common in septums, it was pretty helpful.    After hearing this, I'll definitely be getting some wood plugs for my goal size. My problem ear absolutely hates anything that's not a good long soak in vitamin e.    I'd say you should pick up a cheap bottle of vitamin e oil or stop wearing the tape while you don't have access to your usual oils. That way everything stays oily and lobes are the one place that's okay.    PTFE becomes transparent with oil. A trick used to make it go in better is to oil until it's relatively transparent. It's not thinning or dissolving or anything. That's just the tape absorbing oils and getting clear. Like toilet paper or something. PTFE is also a very drying tape because of it so try to oil it more than thoroughly.    Cheap steel is bad steel.   I'm not able to downsize because all of my tunnels started rusting; that's why I switched back to my CBRs.   I've only been wearing steel from BAF; these piercings have yet to see acrylic   I have both my ears stretched to 8g, and my left ear is fine. My right ear, on the other hand, became really irritated a couple days ago. I've been at 8g for about two months now so it's not due to a recent stretch, and I'm wearing the same CBR's I've worn in the past. It's red and slightly painful, almost dry, although I use vitamin e oil on both ears. I haven't changed any care that I've been doing. Maybe I slept on it funny? It doesn't feel like a tear. Has anyone else had this and possibly know how to fix it?   Ah, thank you   I looked at the site (been looking for some labradorite) and one of the options is wear size. Is this any different than the other size option?   I've been using the immersion reading feature on my kindle with a book for the past couple weeks, and this morning I turned on my kindle to return to my book and the feature was just gone. I can access the ebook and audiobook separately, but the option to use the audiobook with the ebook is no longer available. My kindle is relatively new so it's still under warranty, but I'm hoping there's an easier fix than sending it to get fixed.    Comfortable stretches is always great! I've been hearing surgical steel everywhere but glass seemed like it would be safe as well.    I'm in Wisconsin, so I've been looking for a material that's a bit less chilly.    I've been using steel tapers and single flare tunnels, but I'm wondering if glass is also an option since it seems a bit more comfortable and nicer looking than the steel.    I have zero experience with McDonald's excellent customer service.    I had that fun moment at 12g. One of the best moments ever. It's like becoming an astronaut after wanting to be one since age 6.  	89
 Gov. Schwarzenegger  ^^wait ^^a ^^minute...   This is relativism, and is the laziest, most unhelpful form of reasoning. Basically what you are saying is 'it could be worse, therefore fuck it.' Yes countries exist where quality of life is much worse than in America, but that isn't the issue at all. If a situation is so poor you have to resort to this logic, it must be pretty fucking awful.    A friend of mine who I knew from Kindergarten age enlisted after leaving high school and was shot in the neck on Christmas Eve a few years back. He died after several hours. Remember, men do not give their lives for their country, their country takes their lives without thanks. Joining the armed forces may seem glamourous, thrilling or patriotic, but remember you are volunteering to allow men you have never met to risk your life for reason's that don't concern you.  Most importantly, please consider the effect your joining the armed forces have on your family. I daresay most in this thread will have know of someone or will themselves have lost beloved family member to the forces. Remember it is not only your own happiness you sacrifice by joining.  Please consider your decision very carefully, and don't buy into patriotism. Your country does **not** need you, and by volunteering you will not be safeguarding your country from darkness. I of course have only the absolute greatest respect for any serving men or women and veterans, but I cannot help remember my friend, the loss his family and friends suffered, and the terrible feeling of waste I felt upon hearing the news.  Thanks for reading.   Michael Jackson was a black man. His children all had blonde hair and pale skin. You do the math.   Back, and to the left.  Incidentally, I have looked into this as I found it a genuinely interesting subject. There are holes in the story, and big ones, but the points that generally are raised by conspiracy theorists are mostly entirely falsifiable. It does seem, based on all the evidence, that JFK was shot from the 6th floor of the Book Depository. The kill shot, as seen on that Zapruder film, is consistent with an exit wound from the back right, Kennedy's head moves the way it does because of the exit wound which blasts out the front of his skull causing his head to move back, towards the shot. James Tague (possibly spelt wrong), sometimes referred to as the third wounded man, was nipped by a fragment that could only have come from the direction of the Book Depository. 'The Magic Bullet' is also easily explained. Whether the shooter in the Book Depository was Oswald is unclear, but very likely. If it were just for these facts, there would be no conspiracy theory, it is clear that Kennedy was shot, using Oswald's rifle, from the Depository. Where it gets interesting is Jack Ruby, Clay Bertrand, the reaction of the police when arresting and interrogating Oswald, dramatic change of Kennedy's policy under LBJ, and the fact that many of the secret documents and evidence, including Kennedy's brain, has disappeared. Literally: it is unaccounted for.   Building 7   For those that don't know, Dave Grohl played drums on this song in the studio version   A Hard Rains A-Gonna Fall - Bob Dylan   Thus spake the newlywed   Tonight I had the Burg-As Bro  Little Beer Quarter  *Beef and lamb patty with pork belly, fried quail egg, aged cheddar, chilli-onion jam, pickled beetroot, Tuatara APAioli and lettuce in Pandoro bun, with chips and dip*  Easily the best burger I've had so far, the patty was beef and lamb, which I thought sounded like a weird combo before I tried it but tasted awesome, the pork belly was perfect, and the aioli set the whole thing off nicely. I thought a few crisps with a sour cream/mayonnaise dip instead of chips was a nice touch, and the bun wasn't too heavy so it didn't fill me up to fast. Honestly couldn't find a single thing to fault it, even the beer was nice!!  10/10 - would definitely eat again!   If anyone was interesting, the music is ['Sail - Awolnation'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaAWdljhD5o)   '*It isn't exactly a traditional foetus*' - Best line in the film   Sounds more like a Japanese swear word to me   Easy there Cletus    I emigrated to New Zealand!

EDIT: Downvote all you like, you won't make it any less true   '*Emigrate*' means to move from a country, '*Immigrate*' means to move into another country. Both are applicable in this sentence.

What kind of lens did you use?   An entire story in a single word. This is brilliance.    You're more than welcome, I'll be rooting for you!   Don't go *anywhere* without travel insurance. Seriously. Also, spend more than $10 on it.   I empathise with your plight friend. I of course won't say 'I know what you're going through', because I don't and that is a cliche. I know how it feels though to be silently in pain, and to feel like a burden. Small things make huge differences, allow someone, be it a friend, parent, sibling, anyone, to understand what is causing your behaviour, or why you are unhappy. It seems daunting I know, but this is the first step to getting better, and it's important.  Most important of all though, is you need to show people how strong you are. Endurance is the greatest trait a person can have, because without endurance and your ability to endure pain, strength is meaningless. Remember that you *will* break through this, no matter how hard it is now, not for anyone else, but for yourself. Because you are strong enough to endure it, and once you have proven that to yourself nothing can hurt you, and one day you will be so proud of yourself that you came through a very dark time with your head held high.   No, no I'm not.   It is morally certain that everyone of european decent reading this thread is descended from Charlemagne. It is equally certain that everyone of central or east asian decent reading this will be descended from Genghis Khan. There is also a fairly solid chance that European redditors will be related to at least one of the Caesars.    To all those arguing that the practice is in some way medically beneficial and not linked to religion or sexual repression, consider first that circumcision is not only forced upon men, but upon women also who suffer an even more ghastly and humiliating procedure. There is no justification for female circumcision, at all, other than cruel sexual repression of an infant by an adult, and should not be considered as anything but repugnant.   Consider this before you defend such a barbaric tradition as this, please.   Yes. The practice is a religiously inspired one, and the central tenant in all major religions is sexual repression, which of course is no coincidence. The purpose of circumcision is to weaken an desensitise the organ in question, thus discouraging its use, especially in girls. These are the facts.   Maybe he should have stopped getting his dick out and rubbing it in the sand?   Overweight women in corsets with far, far too much cleavage.   Have you ever read 'The Communist Manifesto' by Karl Marx? You might find it interesting. Throw the phrase 'Means of Production' in that comment and you pretty much have the blurb   Sectarianism. I see plenty of people saying 'religious differences' in this thread, and that is a fair point, religion does tend to be a divider. However, it is not the only one. Sectarianism takes many forms, be it religious, race related or nationality, to name a few. Anything that allows people to use the label "Us" and "Them", rather than "we". This is a primitive and primal instinct, but it is the last obstacle to be toppled before mankind may know peace.   Every single post in this thread is sexual in nature. How very Freudian.    Entropy. For the first time in history the rate of human population has started to increase at exponential speed. Before this present period in history the general population remained steady as life expectancy was far shorter and infant mortality was far more common. The world population only topped 1 billion in approximately 1810. Now there are 7 billion, a 2 billion increase in the last 20 years. This planet is an isolated system, we only have so much energy and as the population increases the energy becomes spread out far too wide and is rendered ultimately useless and finite. No new energy can be created capable of sustaining an exponentially growing population: the human race is, quite simply, unsustainable. The only hope is the discovery of a new boundless energy source (which on principal contradicts the first and second laws of thermodynamics), or extraterrestrial colonisation. It's going to be a scary century.  **EDIT:** Energy in this sense does not only pertain to electricity. Fuel in general is what is meant, be it mechanical, biological or simply food. Solar Power alone will not be enough to sustain humanity.   Not strictly true, I think what you mean is we know more about the surface of the moon or mars than we do about the bottom of the ocean. We clearly don't know more about the endless(?) space of the entire universe more than anything, mainly because a lot of it is unknowable.   The universe is either finite or infinite. Either way the mind boggles   Dude, too soon!   Not the point. These people need unconditional aid. Although American flags on bags of rice or grain do not demand anything from those they help, missionaries do.    Is it just me or are these the biggest aftershocks yet? If you are in an office or in CBD, **GO HOME!!**   Confirmed by Metlink   Where were you? That was easily the noisiest quake I've been in, all my windows were distorting and crunching.

Still feeling the aftershocks, one is going as I type!!   This is a man who sided with Ayatollah Khomeini during the Rushdie affair.

He can be just as fundamental as the worst in America when he wants to be   Actually, that's a common misconception! Yes Christians where horribly persecuted, particularly by some Roman Emperors, but no Christian was ever fed to the lions in the Colosseum! I did have the source for this but can't find it, I'll look it up later   You haven't been watching closely enough. The reason the violence is continuing is because a large islamic group who supported the now ousted president Morsi because of his radical Islamic beliefs have been violently continuing to protest, which has caused the military in turn to violently suppress them. There is politics and revolutionary sentiments obviously, but the reason for the continued violence is Islam, or rather An Islamic group protesting in favour of stricter Sharia Law and Islamification of Egypt.  This is a statement of the facts, with no opinion.   See my edit. Also, you are not of a different species to Hungarian people. A better analogy would be trying to learn to speak dolphin.   Add the juice! Otherwise it will be too dry, it should be a reasonably liquid final product! Experiment though, make it your own thing!   See my edit. Koko could sign enough to get what she wanted or identify her needs, but she couldnt use it to speak normally, as a person would. She had a cat by the way, not a dog :)   In all fairness, this is obviously new (no link older than 14 days) and is relevant to whats going on in the world, and none of the previous submissions gained momentum so most won't have seen this. Also, OP didn't give it a terrible and predictable title. The picture is clever, reasonably provocative and relevant. The repost is acceptable, in this case.   This actually only really helped the medical profession, which is obviously a huge help! Just for day to day use however using loads of anti-bacterial products will actually weaken the immune system. 'Boy in the bubble' principal.   Hugely under appreciated. Mankind has been searching for an effective birth control for thousands of years and it was only definitively discovered, made safe and universally available within the past  two generations   I assume you are american living in the UK? People are all different obviously, I think a general norm is a healthy person would only go to the doctors as and when they need it (maybe once every 6 months average, assuming they are mostly healthy). Dentist's are more of a routine, I would imagine its the same most places. once every 4-6 months, maybe.   It's not such a stupid question, don't worry. No that theory wouldn't work as human communication (in this instance sign language) just isn't natural to chimps or gorillas, their minds just don't work like that. If they want to communicate with one another or with their young, which they do, they do so through other means (i.e body language, eye contact etc). Though they are intelligent enough animals to be taught basic sign language, they can't actually ever use it to communicate efficiently, as a human would, because it simply doesn't make sense to them. It's like a human learning to climb a tree to get fruit from the top branches. Though a child might be able to notice the adult climbing the tree and understand why they are doing it, it won't actually improve the child's climbing ability.  **EDIT**: Okay, I'm getting lots of comments from fairly silly people who apparently don't understand analogies. Chimps cannot use sign language, no none-human animal has ever learned or used sign language in a remotely human function. Some very intelligent animals have been taught how to communicate very basic messages, such as "Look over there," "Give me food," "I want...," etc, but it is not in the nature of an animal to understand human communication, grammar, sentence structure and so on. Surely that is obvious. Monkeys communicate with each other through very different medium. A mother monkey may teach a young monkey how to sign something in order to get food, but this is no different from a human mother showing a child how to open a coconut or cook meat in order to get edible food. It is not language as we use the word, because monkeys do not use language, they simply do not have the necessary brain function to understand or use human-style language.  My climbing trees metaphor may be a poor example, but surely you can get the metaphor? The point I am making is a child cannot learn how to do something unatural to them, like talking to dolphins or building a honeycomb, simply by observing, it is something that has to be taught, because by it's nature it is not normal human behaviour. If you took issue with the statement because children can climb trees, you're an idiot.   Doesn't really matter. Chopped tomatoes are preferable, but if its whole tomatoes you can just mince them up a bit in the pan with a knife or wooden spoon   My Spanish Tomatoes recipe takes 5 minutes and is honestly one of the nicest meals I have ever had. Here goes:  1. Heat up a handsome dollop of Olive Oil in a frying pan, add a few herbs to taste.  2. Add chopped onion, thin sliced garlic, olives, a jalapeno or two, maybe some meat to the hot oil.  3. Allow the onions etc. to fry for a little while, then add most of a tin of tomatoes to the pan, making sure to stir thoroughly  4. add more seasoning, especially a good pinch of salt (sea salt is best), oregano or basil is good, maybe some more garlic or dried garlic flakes. If you have it add a good splash of balsamic vinegar and a cheeky few drops of red wine, stirring thoroughly.  5. Keep stirring and leave on a high heat for a few minutes, until the tomato juice boils off somewhat.  6. Serve! I like to do myself some fried bread with this, which is easy enough, just add a little more oil to the pan after you have plated the tomatoes and put a few slices of bread in the hot oil for a few minutes.  Enjoy! Extra bonus points can be achieved by adding some chorizo sausage and red wine with the onions, and adding feta or parmesan cheese with the balsamic vinegar. Once served sprinkle a little feta cheese and salt over it and you're ready to boogie!   **EDIT**: For those who are going to have a go, comment back with how it goes, especially if you try something original! Lots of people are asking for pictures, unfortunately I don't Instagram my food because I don't have the mind of an 6 year old girl, but if someone who cooks it could upload a picture it would help everyone out! Glad you guys like my recipe! Now go cook it for your friends and make out you've been cooking it for years and you just made it up one night!   Sounds good to me, let us know what you thought of it!   Who's checking out Burger Wellington this year?

People need to stop assigning their own beliefs onto their own version of God. Tutu will no doubt be praised for this, but it is just another example of a religious figure giving their own value to 'God' to either make a point of for political gain. Not cool.   It is conceivable that OP's girlfriend knows this person, it seems like a bit of a strenuous lie otherwise.   Ever so slightly off topic, but I'm English and I remember exactly where I was on 7/7 (The London bombings). I was on a school bus on a school trip to London Central Mosque. We turned the bus around, we thought going to the mosque might not have been sensible on that day.   Did...did you just call Vince a c#*t?   The Nepalese ran an expedition to clean the mountain in, I think, 2010. They filled up several skips and removed many of the bodies. The documentary you watched is probably out of date.   They are prayer flags. The mountain is sacred in Nepalese and Tibetan tradition, they are at the summit to honour the mountain, not someones junk.  This comment thread kind of makes me sick, all I see is a bunch of kids saying how easy this is because many people do it. You guys have the wrong idea, this is a hugely significant achievement, the reason you see pictures of lots of people summiting at once is because there are only a few days in the entire year with good enough conditions to summit.   Climbing Everest is still an immense physical achievement. Yes a few people have done it by now, but the huge majority fail every year. One in eight people die climbing Everest. It is a very big deal to stand at the top of the world, and one of the most physically gruelling things a human can do. It's isn't as though there is a stair lift the whole way, it takes several days and real strength to climb. Yes there are more challenging mountains in terms of mountaineering ability, but that isn't the point.  OP, your girlfriend is epic and deserves the highest of fives, bravo! I trekked to Base Camp a few years back, I felt privileged just to be there, let alone attempt a climb. Make sure you hang on to this one, she's a keeper!    They are prayer flags. The mountain is sacred in Nepalese and Tibetan tradition, they are at the summit to honour the mountain, not someones junk.    Change but the name and this story is about you.    An elderly woman sits down to her supper alone, for the first time.   Chiang Mai, Thailand right?   As it happens I have been round the world 3 times so far, the first time when I was 18 when I travelled alone, self-financed and unaided for 9 months. I was attacked by a cobra in Laos, had a close call with a tiger in Burma, and was nearly mugged in Kathmandu, although was able to defend myself. I have seen more death than many my age and have plenty of experience of the darker side of humanity. And I have never felt the need to carry a gun. Please don't lecture me on how the world works, I don't come to your place of work and knock the sailors cocks out of your mouth do I? Grow up a bit, and realise the world isn't out to get you. If you are not a complete idiot, you will never be in enough trouble to need a gun. If you are that much of a moron, carrying a gun will only put you in more danger than it will prevent. Grow up.   To defend yourself from what exactly? Just admit you carry a gun to feel more in control, or more masculine. Comments like the above just make you look like a paranoid dumbass, so the choice you have is to represent that facade to the world, or admit you are an insecure yet decent person with penis issues. If you are in law enforcement, or are being hunted by cannibals, you would have a point. But this is the real world, you are not the star of a movie, so please do yourself a favour and cut the action-hero bullshit, and maybe just stuff a few socks down there.      I would have a great deal more respect for pro-gun individuals, such as yourself, if you could simply stand up and say 'I carry a gun because it makes me feel safer and more in control/confident', rather than spew these ridiculous, hole-ridden arguments. A first aid kit is in now way the logical or moral equal of a gun. It is a moral certainty that no situation will occur in your day to day life that will require you to be carrying a gun, or that you will be somehow be able to 'save the day' or be in a better position than anyone else because you are armed, you will almost certainly only put yourself at greater risk. This isn't the movies.   The only exception to this rule is if you work or live somewhere where there are dangerous animals (e.g bears) or for self defence if someone breaks into your home, in which case it is permissible to own a small gun which can be stored in a safe place in the house. There is no reason to carry a gun in your day to day life, assuming you aren't a member of law enforcement, and it would be nice if you would be honest enough with yourself(ves) to admit that.   Why carry at all?   More paranoid than thinking it is in any way necessary for an ordinary citizen to carry a gun?  EDIT: **OMG LOGIC!! SHOOT IT!!!**   Compulsive liars of reddit, come forth!!

I haven't even seen the film, it might be wonderful, but it's called 'Gangster Squad'. Did a 3 year old come up with this name? I mean, seriously?   Fuck the plot, Salma Hayek!!!   If you read the original script by Alex Garland the ending is actually pretty awesome. I love the film personally, but I do think Danny Boyle made a few errors in judgement in how he shot the end sequence, but that is just my taste. In Garland's script each characters storyline comes full circle in the end, theres no silly punch-up between Pinbacker and Capa, and Pinbacker has a much more awesome (dare I say, fitting?) death.   I often think the older I get the more the world looks like a creme brulee   Fantastically written dissection of the film! I thoroughly enjoyed reading your critique, I would be interested to hear what scenes were deleted from the film which might have fleshed-out the character a little more or covered some of the plot-holes, any examples spring to mind?   Sometime, in moments of extreme stress, a persons mind will simply disconnect from its surroundings in a primal psychological attempt to escape. If, for example, a person were being tortured over a long period of time, their mind would invariably enter a make-believe state. These hallucinations can be extremely vivid, as though the person is living an ordinary life, or can be more like a fantasy, like driving a fast car. Time and reality can be constant or inconstant in these dream states, for example you may at one moment believe you are in one fantasy when your brain will suddenly jump to another, fabricating memories or circumstances to fit the hallucination. But the real world always eventually will force itself back in on the hallucination in order to bring the victim back to reality, be it noises, physical pain or, more commonly, the face or faces of whomever is present in the real world with the person suffering the hallucination. Other times, when these stimuli don't work, the mind of the sufferer will continue to point out the flaws in the fantasy, like waking up from a dream, to force the victim out of the dream-state and to wake up, as prolonging the hallucination may result in insanity, the sufferer must be brought back to the real world, you must WAKE UP   Our Solar System will have been destroyed long before then, by several billion years. Not to worry!   A day will come when the sun will rise on the world and everyone and everything alive now will be dead and gone. It will be a normal day, the sun will rise, and no one will care.   I sometimes wonder when I am walking down a crowded street how many of the normal, every-day looking people around me have committed murder or rape, or any other terrible crime. So many crimes are unsolved, so many killers or even serial killers walk free. They could walk past me on the street at any moment, dressed in normal clothes, looking like normal people. And I would have no idea.   that's utter rubbish and a total cop-out    Mallory and Irvines first failed ascent of Everest.

I'm not sure if this counts, but I have been present, as a civilian, at a number of mass-demonstrations and social uprisings, in Thailand and Nepal, probably being the most dangerous. The Bangkok riots (pretty sure they were on the news a few years back) were intense and turned violent quickly, no one could leave or enter Bangkok for several days as the airport was closed and the roads were jammed, and an unofficial curfew was in place. There was a huge military presence, lots and lots of guns and I even saw a line of tanks on Ratchadamnoen Klang, one of Bangkok's main streets. It was an interesting experience and the first time I heard gunshots fired in anger, but I kept my head down and after a few days was able to leave. An interesting few days they were though.   I travelled around the entire world alone when I was 18. I was completely self-funded and I managed to make my way across Asia to the Indian sub-continent and got AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness or Altitude Sickness) while climbing to Mount Everest Base Camp, among many, many other bizarre and awesome experiences. I am fucking proud of it as I see it as a major achievement, but it's impossible to talk about it without sounding pretentious or arrogant, so it never really gets mentioned. It already feels like it has become a private story or memory, which it shouldn't be, because it doesn't get talked about.

Seriously?   Don't panic too much, the reason we are having so many close together is there are literally tens of fault lines around wellington and through the cook straight. The quake on friday morning will have relieved pressure in one place but put more strain on a separate fault, like a domino effect. It is possibly a good sign that right after the 6.5 there was another 5.5, so maybe the pressure has been relieved. There is no way of knowing though, but don't panic!!

Things were falling off the walls here in Pukerua Bay, is the centre of Wellington okay? Any damage? Geonet now says it was a 6.5 followed immediately by a 5.5   Very hard to say, there are literally tens of them all in the cook straight, and the top of South Island. What has likely happened is one quaked caused another fault line to go in roughly the same area.  Where did you feel it? Any damage where you are?   The problem is there are so many fault-lines around Wellington and the Cook Straight, when one goes it relieves pressure on one fault but puts loads of extra pressure on a separate fault, like a domino effect. That's why we have so many close together.          Is everyone alright? It hasn't caused any damage in town has it? It felt quite substantial up in Pukerua Bay!   Immortality   	125
    Don't forget the impact of lead poisoning.                          What type of person goes on line pretending to be something so that they can make a group look bad.   A troll.  Unless they're getting paid, in which case they are, as you said, a shill.   Great bathrooms, though.   That's because this is the same form they use when you're making a noise complaint or whatnot.                                        No, no. Cut them in half, cover with a maple-dijon sauce, roast at 350.  Alternatively, if you like to saute things, saute with bacon until good and caramelized, let cool, mix in sour cream.   Same as you roast any other vegetable - cover with oil and spices and perhaps a sauce, toss it in the oven at 350 until cooked.   Well, all dark leafy greens, even those not related to the brassica family, do tend to have similar nutrients.    It's a myth. Is it true you guys boil yours instead of roasting or steaming them?   Nice. You should crosspost that at /r/infographics   Mustard, the condiment, is made from mustard seeds and other things. You'd want to eat mustard greens to get the benefits of kale without eating kale.   Yes you are. It's a root vegetable, like turnips (another brassica), but less peppery. You can eat it raw in salads, or you can roast it just like you would a potato (or turnip). It's very crunchy, with a mild flavor.   Mustard is certainly a brassica, along with the above list and also turnips, bok choi, and (more distantly) radishes.  If you see mustard greens in the market, you'll see they're similar to turnip greens and kale. And if you ever plant cabbage or cauliflower, you'll see the seeds are very similar to mustard seeds.   Wikipedia is the one in error if they don't list mustard as a member of the brassica family.   I made that same mistake before reading the article, to be honest.                                             Undoubtedly, but plenty of people don't realize exactly how many we've been involved in so far.   Didn't really think that one through, did they.

I'm always interested in hearing more :)               Indeed.    Not that different. Babylon 5 managed to have gays, and that's contemporary with Deep Space 9.   Is it still George Washington's axe if we replace the handle once and the blade twice?   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus  If you come up with a definitive answer, I think there's a Nobel prize in it for you.   Welcome to the wide world of discontinuity.  http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity  For example, pretty much everybody agrees that Threshold never happened. It's an awful episode. Throw it out the window!  http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Discontinuity/LiveActionTV  If you scroll down, they have a lot of examples of popular "nope never happened" occurrences in Star Trek.   If you have to stand around waiting for the paint to dry before you can leave, you're still painted into it for the duration.   Those episodes are at least female-centered, so I'm okay giving a half-pass. (Other opinions may vary, and this is okay.)   Buffy fans argue all the time. I mean, maybe not your mom, but on the whole.    It was the execution that failed.  I suspect that's the crux of the Voyager hate. I mean, it's not a bad series - not great, but hell, there are plenty of episodes from each series that are really awful. But when you compare what might have been to what we got... geez.      I don't like Neelix and Kes together  it works on paper, but they have absolutely no chemistry together.  You know, if they'd settled that issue properly, that would have made sense. Neelix and Kes hooked up because of the whole way they met and how she got rescued. This is not such an uncommon story, and oftentimes couples that start this way find out later that they're not suited for each other.   But they never resolved it properly, which means that instead of a proper story we have... a couple with no chemistry and you don't know why they stay together.    Paris works quite well, though towards the end of the series it's ridiculous how many things they have him doing or being an expert it.  Yes, it is. There's no reason they couldn't have fobbed some of that off on Harry, given him something to do besides lack any form of growth. Harry could've been the more or less competent medic, and we could have seen that all those Holodeck programs were the combined efforts of Harry and Tom together rather than Tom being a good writer and a decent programmer as well.  That's two complaints with one fix.   You know, Jeri Ryan is a surprisingly good actor. You keep thinking she's just male gaze eye candy, but she just keeps surprising you!   The Q episodes on Voyager are the only Q episodes I am willing to watch. (Well, other than the single scene where Q get punched by Sisko, that's great.) Which is good, because I utterly refuse to watch any episode with the Borg Queen, so it evens out.  Ugh, the Borg Queen. If she's going to be creepy and sexually repressed, I want to know why she doesn't just modify a drone to... well, anyway, those episodes make me cringe in all the bad ways.   The good episodes could be really good, and there weren't too many cringe-worthy clunkers.  Unfortunately, most episodes were just... eh. They weren't good, they weren't bad, they were simply watchable.  However, I will point out something I really liked, although it's hard to explain why. In one episode on Voyager, the whole crew is going crazy trying to solve this brain teaser puzzle. On TNG, a fad like that had a decent shot of being an evil alien conspiracy. On Voyager, it was just a fad like the last one Paris spread around - yo-yos! I don't know why, but that tickled me pink.    Can you honestly say you'd be entirely happy continuing the relationship?  Well, I'd be a little weirded out, but I like to think that I'm dating/married to this person for who they are, not how they look. If I'm not going to split up with them for getting into a car accident and losing a limb, or for growing older, or for suddenly developing an inconvenient allergy, or for getting cancer, then I certainly hope I'm not going to ditch them for a relatively minor cosmetic change!  How shallow do you think we all are, anyway?   Or 3 - Star Trek diverged from our universe somewhat earlier than previously supposed.   Actually, people do like them. Comics with Miles Morales *sell*. That's why they're introducing him in the main universe.   Buuuuut that's exactly what we're talking about - Peter Parker training Miles Morales as Spiderman. Did you read the article?   It's not making Parker gay. It's bringing Miles Morales into the main universe, and they're only doing this because stories with Miles Morales sell. I don't even *read* comics, I gleaned this all from my nieces, and it makes perfect sense to me.  They're doing what *makes money*. That's what they *always* do.   You do realize that the original Annie was a blonde, right? And that Thor was a frog for a while?   He's saying that Spiderman shouldn't be Miles Morales.                                          You're looking at a correlation and assuming a causation. There's no evidence for this.    How odd. I don't know how that happened, thanks for catching it.                           It's the context. People only ever say that to imply that so-and-so got the job due to their race or sex, and not on their merits.   Because people never say that in a vacuum. Instead, they say it specifically to non-whites and women to oh-so-subtly imply that *really* those people only got the job due to affirmative action and not because they are the most qualified.  It's all about the context, and just about the only context in which people say this is to insult those they believe - on zero evidence - should have let a white man get the job instead.   Worse news for the refugees, I should think.  The developed world is facing a population crunch. They're going to have to either accept more refugees and immigrants or watch as their numbers dwindle into irrelevancy.  They're reluctant to do the former because they're worried about the new demographics, but the latter isn't actually a viable plan.      That's very close to 1% of the worldwide population.      You're assuming that DarthGregor wasn't raised by two men or two women already.  And yes, I would say that in front of my mother (or my father, were he still alive). I'd also say I'd be just as happy had I been switched at birth with some other kid, because I would be. Why not? I wouldn't know any different.  And don't forget, most gays  who want kids adopt. A child in foster care would be grateful for *any* permanent, loving family. This isn't an either/or proposition for them.   You are aware that half of all gay people ARE women, right?   We certainly can't if your response to people who disagree with you is "oh, I think you're lying, welp, best stop talking about it!"  Drives me batty when people throw these things out like we'll all agree, and then refuse to engage with people who don't.  The difference between you and me is *I know people who grew up in households headed by same-sex couples*. I also know people who were raised by grandparents, or by their aunts and uncles, and I know people who were raised in foster care. That last group is the only one that spends much time worrying they would have had a better childhood had they been raised differently, because *any* permanent family would have been better than being shuffled around.   I don't need to resort to hypotheticals, because I have observation on my side.   These people don't interact with the world in any sort of meaningful way, as near as I can tell. I know people who have grown up with gay parents, they're as happy and well-adjusted as anybody else. I know people who have grown up in foster care, they'd've been happier for ANY permanent family, no matter what the composition.   And I've got the studies to back up the observation of my life. These people don't, which is why they have to rely on random hypotheticals, because they apparently don't realize that there are people who already live their oh-so-scary lives and are just fine.   Probably would be if more people were aware of them. They're harmless, and they're reusable.   There are a few potential problems here, though. For one thing, not all women can use menstrual cups, and for another, those who can aren't all shaped the same way and a cup that works for one might not work for another.   They're reusable. You probably ought to boil them if you've had a yeast infection, and some women prefer to boil them every cycle, but you don't need to do so - simply washing with soap and water at the end of your cycle is sufficient.   It's not solely due to lack of funds. I mean, if that were the case I'd be glad to donate a freaking case of Divacups, but our damned punitive mindset... geez.         Sadly, it's normally racist.   About 3% of the population of the US identifies as gay or bisexual.   However, there is a glaring problem with this number, and that's the fact that it depends on self-identification. We just don't know how many people have same-sex attractions but are unwilling to admit it, even on an anonymous survey. Heck, some of them might not admit it to themselves.  Edit: Google suggests that the percentage of people under 35 who identify as gay or bi is slightly higher than 3%, this is consistent with my speculation above.   Alex, I'll take pointless hypotheticals for $1000, please.  If I had two dads, that would be my normal. I'd be okay with that. If i had two moms, that would likewise be my normal. If I was raised by my grandma, or by Ma and Pa Kent, *that would be normal to me*.  No matter how we grow up, that's our basis of comparison. So long as they're loved, children thrive.                                                    I think it's important to recognize people who have done great things for America. For example, I'm Jewish. I can't really name a Jew who's done something major for America, even though I'm sure there are buttloads.   Jean Lafitte. Albert Einstein. Jerry Siegal :P                                                            It's certainly going to be interesting to see how the maps get redrawn once this all shakes out. I mean, we're in for a long wait on that front, but....                                          At least, once they were taken to the edge of the valley and shown they weren't "real", they worked out that whoever programmed them probably made it so they'd never explore too far.   Have you considered a graywater system for flushing your toilet?   Into the ocean, mostly. It IS a closed system - but you and I can't drink salt water.   Like Sandy?    You're forgetting the part where coastal flooding will be *salt* water.   Most of the planet is oceans. Most rain eventually hits an ocean - not land. Once it hits the ocean, it mixes with the salt water there and becomes salty. You can't drink salt water. You can't irrigate your crops with salt water.   We are. But you can't drink salt water.   You skimmed, didn't you.   Picture group therapy.  On the one hand, a mixed group will have a lot of women who, understandably, may not be comfortable discussing their rapes in front of men.  On the other, you have men who as a result of their rape may be feeling emasculated or other things like that and might feel even more uncomfortable by the unspoken implication that only women get raped.  In this particular case, it makes sense to have two groups.   When you're stimulated enough, your body responds, whether you want to or not. A woman can certainly manipulate the penis until it gets hard or even orgasms. Difficult as it is to believe, there doesn't have to be desire for this to happen. There are many cases in war-torn places, for example, where men and boys have been forced to rape their sisters, daughters, or grandmothers. Obviously they didn't want to do this.  Women can also force cunnilingus or anally rape others.   In Sweden, or...?    Problem is if everyone is guaranteed basic income it'll never work, Inequality is practical essential for an economy to work  Citation needed.   Yes, and were replaced by other things. Where are the replacements this round?   Well, perhaps all that money does make people stupid.  	200
 Sounds like a condensed version of Ground Hog Day, only 100% creepier and -100% Bill Murry.   Sent shivers down my spine though. You really let the reader's imagination take the rest on it.    He's a med student. He probably did it cleanly and efficiently. Plus with 200K he'd get a sweet prosthetic.   Nice ending! I thought he'd be bulimic or something, but I didn't consider that!  	2

       Yea I've been thinking about stretching my budget and getting the heritage, was hoping for a $400 set with head and fork.  Suppose I could hold off on new wheels, just feel weird about putting my dumpster depot retrospec wheels on a halfway decent frame.   Thanks for the heads up about blb,  Don't really need anything save the frame fork headset and wheels.  Picking up wheels from velomine, and if I only get a frame I'll be getting the fork at retro-gression.  So I'm hoping to find something at cg.   Yea it's a great price for a solid frame, good luck with your beater build!      If you are dropping that much on parts and it's your first build make sure you don't forget the grease.    Beautiful contrast.  Keep it up!   Hey I got a gift card to citygrounds, and I'm looking for a cro-mo frameset, or frame.  I am never gonna ride track, and new England roads aren't good.  So I'm assuming aluminum wouldn't be my best best.  My only problem is their cromo selection isn't very good.  I'm not sure if it's just a weird time of year before the 2015s start coming in.  I really dig the blb lo-pro frameset, but they don't have any in my size.  I would buy the fuji feather complete but they don't ship.  The pake rumrunner seems to be my best option at the moment, but I'd rather get something double-butted.  Should I settle on the pake, wait, or does anyone have an opinion? Flexible on price, and I don't need anything immediately.           Yea I hate the fact that it's been in sale albeit in early access for what seems like almost 2 years, and it's still virtually unplayable.            I really hope so.      Samsungs is cheap because it's not worth it.  It has extremely limited applications bottlenecked by underpowered handheld devices.  Not to mention it has no head tracking opposed to stream vr/sony vr/Oculus.   At this point it's like every big release, of which we really haven't gotten many new console exclusives.   Nah, no confirmations yet.  Hoping it's under 300.            Wheelchair ass jimmy.   Panforte looks super, thanks for the list. Awful lot of all-caps though.   Currently at work in a print shop thinking "the printing press is my printing press.."  Good job to Wheeler though.   More polygons are more polygons regardless of resolution.  There isn't much of a crazy difference, or a noticeable difference.  Unless you are playing the same game on ps4 and ps3 at the same time on tv's next to each other.   Sounds good man,  yeah I haven't been home much the past few days so I haven't even seen the current state of the game, but I'll check it out tonight.  I have the same name on Skype, so feel free to use that and our pass it around if you have any artists that want to bounce around ideas.   86, probably Licensed to ill.  Not really into pre 90's rap though.   Let me know if you need any ui assets/menu pages.  Trying to build up a decent portfolio anyhow.   We'll see, he earned it regardless.  Although I don't see him doing the label and avoiding being a feature.   Nope, I could see a 1st person viewing camera for spectators at some point.  I don't see valve doing another tf, cs, or dota.  Their fan base just has way to much money invested in those games.     I like the concept,  But it gets a bit weird to read especially the u and v.  Did you think of maybe breaking the individual triangles into 3 smaller triangles so you would have a bit more placement options?   How did you wind up in your mom's cousins roommate's basement?  And why did this person have games in the basement?     Hmm would fall-out work?   The ps4 wasn't announced at e3.   good find, trying to check out. super slow      I'd like to see naughty dog doing something new, all though at this point naughty dog isn't really even naughty dog anymore.  After all the devs that left last year at least.   I used this tutorial series to make sliders for my interface ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzIV_c81ovk ), and I want to somehow link my vertical slider to control scrolling the room up/down.  Essentially my background is 1280X1400, and my view/port is 1280X720.  I tried something along the lines of if x is at bottom of bar move_to_position(0,1400,spd)  just to see if I could get the screen to scroll at all.  Instead the slider sprite just hopped off the bar and went to that position.  any help would be greatly appreciated..  edit : not sure if I could if (X=50%  of slider position.  move_to_xview, 0, move_to_yview,1400, spd) sorry new/bad at coding, and cant find anyone else that has done anything similar.   Because he is extremely popular.  Just about anyone who has a passing interest in rap music knows Kanye.  If 50,000,000 have heard his music and 1,000,000 think he is a genius you will hear these peoples opinions more regularly than some underground guy that might only have 20k fans that all think he is a genius.   Nice style for sure, but I'd chill with the floor boards.  Unless it's an integral part of the game.  Thinking Bastion where the world is shaping around the player.   Just maintain aspect ratio and run it 16:9 with black box's.  Don't see why they would allocate resources for something less than 1% of players want.   The 290 is pretty solid.  Personally I wouldn't go with an i3,  maybe look into an amd chip.  Not sure what your best bet is amd wise but they can be really solid and are generally much cheaper than Intel chips.   If you are remotely technically savvy I'd pay 4-500 for a pc.  If you want to strictly use your tv then you save on buying a monitor, and you can get a 360 wireless dongle which will support 4 players on wireless 360 controllers.  Plus buying games on steam will probably save you money in the long run.  Not to mention if you get used to putting computers together and trouble shooting after college you can reward yourself with baller computer parts.  Edit: a console isn't a bad option now a days if you don't feel like getting in over your head.  Both have their subscription plans with free games monthly.   It's a beautiful case, and you are paying 2k for a beautiful custom case.  It's a solid computer, but not a $2000+ computer.   I don't think this is the right demographic. Try /r/gaming maybe?   http://www.gamefaqs.com/vita/732136-monster-hunter-frontier-g/answers/377075-can-you-play-monster-hunter-frontier-g-ps-vita-in-the-us   Technically you could put the old break levers on the flats if you want it quick and cheap.  Riding drops might get a little scary though.   Heat is real bad about gun shots and quiet dialog, but I don't watch a ton of blu-rays so I can't attest to all of them. Figure I'd give a warning anyhow   Depending on if op is talking about pleveling or just leveling.  Either way if you are killing mobs slowly in torment 1 it's more or less a judgement call on trying for torment only legendary items vs working up to efficient torment farming.   You are killing more mobs faster on master increasing the opportunity for good loot to drop.   Microsoft should just force business owners into a subscription plan. (Kidding)  But really the company I work for has ~400 terminals with Windows xp.  I'm guessing that isn't an uncommon thing, they need to find a way to incentivize businesses to upgrade their software.  I think Apple as of the last few years is a crazy anomaly that hinges on consumers far to much.  I don't think either company is going away, they will probably even out in the coming years.  But man these past few years of witnessing the scrappy apple comeback has been crazy.   A. Internet speed=/= net neutrality.  B.  Replace old switches, or better yet run fiber lines.  Congestion problems are gone, and everyone gets faster service.  They have no problem charging a ~$5.00 rental fee for a 10 year old docsis 1.0 modem for literally ever, and they can't spend a dime on improving their offered services.   Couldn't you just play the mkv in your web browser and cast that.   Not my size, but good luck to entrants.  Thanks for the giveaway!   A lot of pros that have been playing cs for years are probably used to playing in 4:3, plus everyone has a position and is watching each others backs.  So they don't need to be bothered looking at the edges. Then a minuscule performance bump.  If you are pugging I don't see any true benefit to playing 4:3.   Apparently one can never not survive.   meh, in that case hearthstone is pay to win.  Pay for a booster pack that might have something nice.  I'm sure they will balance it if people are getting crazy amounts of guns.  Granted I don't need another zombie survival bs game so it's whatever to me, hope it works out for the people who were waiting.   http://www.designsbytue.com/-ezp-5.html  In the about us section they state "Ran Ban" Sun glasses a whole lot.   I saw that video where he was Jesus once.  It was dumb as hell.   None   An entire year? Really?   Edit: Destiny released the first day of 2014 in Adelaide? Sure..   I think it's a problem with your ssd.  I have a cheap 60gb Kingston from 3 years ago that hasn't had any of those problems..  Edit: you didn't format it did you?  Not that formatting one should cause that many redundancy errors.  Especially not for a decent modern ssd.   Longer inseam, smaller leg opening.  But I wouldn't expect them to stay while being active.   Neither of those pictures show someone riding a bike, or sitting.  You could try never bending your knees..   An expensive purse, individually hand made using top notch materials.  Generally loses value or maintains the same value once taken out of the store.  A knife made once and cloned however many times are deemed necessary.  Increases in value about 200% once taken out of the store.  I understand that they both serve a purpose, and are luxury items.  But any high fashion generally holds a value beyond supply and demand.  Such as materials and man hours.

    Yeah and Ring Around The Rosie is about the Bubonic Plague.   This is an Old Spice commercial waiting to happen.      Why the fuck did you kill Chris Farley?

The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins is a really enlightening book about the nuances of the theory of natural selection and simplifies the world into replicators (genes) and vehicles (organisms).

 Z3+/Z4 should've never existed (in the sense that this Z5 should've been the Z4. Sony shouldn't be launching mid-generation "flagship" devices with the main change being that it has a newer version of Android, which just means it will stop supporting the previous flagship faster).   And yet it will lack USB Type C...which could've been pretty useful, especially for charging such a large battery more quickly.  Priorities, Sony!          Every citizen can electronically vote on almost any decision and policy that concerns him  So you think hacking will not exist by 2100? That's probably the most optimistic thing you said.         By accurate do you mean "not lying"? Then, yes it is.   AirVPN seems to be safe:  https://airvpn.org/topic/14231-ipv6-leakage-and-dns-hijacking/#entry27633         What about using Microsoft's Passport tech (which apparently is being standardized for FIDO 2.0), which authenticates the user locally, and then authenticates him with a service, without that service getting any real information, like his password or whatever:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amBknB1nOYE  Also, I'd prefer fingerprint recognition to facial recognition. Much harder to spoof since you don't have your fingerprints all over the web, unlike your face.      What kind of nonsense is this not to include the cable? A cable and a charger is/should be part of the "whole package" of a smartphone, even more so than headphones.   Indeed. Denver would've been more interesting for emulating games with its significantly higher single-threaded performance, but it seems Nvidia has just scrapped it due to its poor choky multi-tasking performance.   I think Nvidia should try again to make its own core, but this time forego the in-order "software-based" design and instead do a regular 7-way out-out-order core with a low clock speed and on whatever  smallest process node is out there (Nvidia keeps using older process nodes in their chips when they launch them, which is unfortunate).  Even continuing to use ARM's cores (A72) with its own GPU, but using the latest node and without exaggerating with the CPU's clock speed, Nvidia could still show a nice chip for mobile.                                                                        It drops in performance with each new benchmark by the looks of it.   And I believe it was first reported by **Sarah O'Connor** at Financial Times.  It has begun. The Terminators are here and they're trying to cover it up saying it was just a "regular machine" that killed him, kind of how they always say in vampire movies that the victims got killed by a "wild animal".      This post disagrees:  http://androidandme.com/2015/07/news/lg-g4-performance-benchmarks-vs-reality/                        Fast chargers do it in ~1h.                        Hybrids will be about as successful as "hybrid PCs" - jack of all trades, master of none (yet still expensive).  Hybrids can't focus on maximum battery efficiency because they have to hold a whole other system in there (gas-powered one). Plus, you still have to do all the same maintenance as you do for a regular car. If you don't want a tiny battery (which is what all hybrids have) then it will cost you much more to buy and own a hybrid than a full EV in the same range.   Yeah, this shouldn't be more than 20,000 euro, otherwise it will have a problem beating the competition.                  That actually happens in the U.S. a lot too, with the Supreme Court just citing Uncle Ben from Spiderman recently, or other politicians arguing that "torture works" because they saw it does on "24"...and so on.   W...what?  Only in the USA. I wonder how many other criminals get a movie deal.                        I think the problem is that it was *supposed* to be made for dog-fighting too - so it already has those kinds of "compromises" (to make dog fighting possible) *built-in*.  In other words, the F-35 is a jack of all trades and master of none.         I'm sure they're only making a competitor to Model 3 not Model S. It talks about an e-Golf in the article.   Is Cabinet being actively developed? It's been in "beta" for a year.         Environmentally friendly in the "lower CO2 than petrol" sense perhaps, but it has a lot of NoX particles which can cause cancer.   Obviously there are some real transition pains to consider, but I believe ultimately they are a small price to pay when a country's institutions can use its own open source distro along with open source software and taxpayers money are used in an open way instead of filling American corporations' pockets by paying for software which could even be backdoored.  But other than that, I also believe Microsoft is a big obstacle in countries adopting Linux, both directly (heavy lobbying against it), but also indirectly (not giving OEMs a choice but to use Windows in most markets, and even if they want to use an open source solution, Microsoft might ask them to pay a fee anyway - patents, etc).   Unlike Sanders or Paul, Obama actually voted for the Patriot Act extension *before the general election* happened (as a Senator). Sanders and Paul have always voted against this sort of stuff.  Lesson here: vote based on their *track record* not on what they're saying alone (cough Clinton cough).   I think either Sanders or Paul would make good progress on *this issue*, so I hope the 2 final candidates are Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders. That way if either one of them loses, we still get another that's against mass spying.   There's another provision that says "they can continue to spy on people which are *under investigation*".  I imagine in these 6 months they will start up millions of "investigations", only so they can continue spying on them after USA Freedom Acts enters in effect fully.   Yeah, and Model 3 should have at least 200 miles, too, although I think initial rumors put it at 250 miles, but that may not be accurate.  Also, I think Tesla's official numbers may be more accurate, kind of how Apple's battery life numbers are (or at least were in Steve Jobs' days, now I think Tim Cook has started exaggerating a bit, or at least mentions the light usage as if it were moderate usage) more accurate than most laptop manufacturers' numbers, which tended to claim battery life numbers that were about 2x what you'd get in the real world (remember those 8h battery life claims with 6-cells in 2009 or so? Never true).  For instance, I saw a recent review of the Renault ZOE, and they said it has a 130 mile range, yet the reviewer put it more at like 80 miles (~130 KM, which is about 40% less).  So unless proven otherwise, I'd much rather trust Tesla's "200 mile range" claims than other car manufacturers' "200 mile range" claims.   Also, although not a foolproof way to verifty, checking the battery size should give a good idea of the range, too. For instance if Tesla will use a 60 kWh battery to achieve that 200 mile range claim, but VW will use a 40 kWh one, then it will be a lot more clear who's telling the truth.                                          NSA looking to tap into cables again?                                                                        What about the NSA? What if the NSA needs them? Think about the NSA!  Microsoft seems to think about them, at least.   Well no. The CAFC ruled that APIs can be copyrighted. The Supreme Court stayed the ruling.  HOWEVER, Google's case *per se* was sent to a lower Court to see if Google's "violation" was actually covered under fair use. But even if Google wins that one, APIs still remain copyrightable as per the last CAFC ruling.  tl;dr Google still has a chance to win the case, but the software industry is *already* screwed (unless the 9th Circuit Court overturns the CAFC ruling, but seems unlikely).   My problem with it is that it claims to be one of the most secure apps, yet it doesn't even provide end-to-end encryption by default. It leaves it to the user to enable it. Therefore for 99% of people or cases, it not's a privacy/security tool. It's just like any other IM app with HTTPS encryption.         I see what you did there.   And Snapdragon 810 :(                        Not connected to the Internet. Cars likely will be.   That's not all. The police will probably get "emergency powers" to stop a car remotely when in "pursuit" or whatever. Some politicians in the EU have asked for the ability to remotely stop a car's engine already.  Oh, and the NSA, or Russia, or China, or your local drug cartel could probably hack into your self-driving car and kill you while you drive 80mph on the highway.  Fun times ahead!   "But sir, everyone does it!"                        Which is great. But make it fully opt-in so users who "want that potential" can choose to enable it. Don't enable it for all unaware users.  It doesn't matter if it's "just an algorithm". That data will be stored on Google's servers so either hackers or abusive governments around the world can get that data.  You know how the OPM hacked happened? That could happen to Google, too (and in fact it *has happened* - [NSA hacked Google](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-24751821)).      Fewer jobs.                              Interesting, but "Google Now on tap" will still be able to see all the data within all Android apps on M, *unless* developers "opt-out" of that.   I believe they are able to do that by *reading what's on the screen* in those apps (or perhaps in RAM), therefore bypassing any transport encryption that app may have.   I think it's a very unfortunate thing for Google to do, especially when the default is *opt-out*, which probably means 90% of the developers won't even be aware this exists, let alone knowing how to disable it to protect their users' privacy.  https://youtu.be/gmgut7SR8p8?t=1m57s      It doesn't though. Look at Youtube and others. They may have the same width, but not the same height. The only way to fix this is to put a fixed background shape behind all of them, like Apple does it (and many Android themes/icon packs do too).   The new clock icon is by far the most annoying. So tiny compared to the rest.  By the way, I agree that iOS does it better and it looks much more elegant to have them *look* the same size, but the way iOS does that is by having a "background" of the same size for all icons.   Check the Chrome icon in that example. It has a background on it, which makes it *look* the same size as all the other icons, but it's not.  Personally, I wish Google adopted the same idea, too, because Android icons look "too messy".                           Does that mean it will get some of he privacy features Siri/Apple's photos AI got for offline/local mode?                                          I wish Google would also allow users to create a "new account", like you can do now in Lollipop, but one that is completely isolated from your normal account and has "root" privileges. Kind of how Windows has Administrator and Standard accounts.   Android accounts are by default "Standard" for security purposes - and that's great - but they should allow power users to have extra privileges on their phones, too, without having to resort to exploits in software.   I wouldn't trust any of Microsoft's products:  https://hexatomium.github.io/2015/06/26/ms-very-quietly-adds-18-new-trusted-root-certs/                                    Ugh, I thought this is some new confirmation or something. It's last year's news.   Or we could just send stuff through hyperloops over the ocean.  	200
 no problem :)   What game are you talking about?    yes you can buy ranks in the skills as if they were trained.   Yes you can :)  Hey I remember you from my [Lfg post](http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/1xn44v/online_star_wars_edge_of_the_empire_new_gm/) last week. Did you ever find a group that fit your schedule?   Hey man, I got your message. Are you sure you can't do Thursdays? I changed the listing to Thursday's because I'm now occupied for the the other days.   Hi, my name is Ryan. This is my first time GMing an rpg. I'm looking for new or inexperienced players, but veterans are welcome if you're willing to be friendly and patient with new players. For schedule I'm thinking weekly games on Thursday. Games would be about 4:30pm PST. Session time I guess would be a few hours, I have yet to try the system so I'm not sure. If you're interested send me a message with a way I can talk to you (preferably Skype) so we can discuss things and I can get to know you. Thanks for clicking and have a nice day/evening.   Edit: I changed the game date to Thursdays. As of now I'm just not able to do it any other day.  Edit 2: Party's full. Thanks for the help guys :)   He didn't, he was the property of Princess Leia. She just gave him orders to find Obi-Wan.   Sure. Could you message me some kind of contact info so we could talk more?   Hi! If I don't get any hits on this I might just GM one myself. I've never done it before, but there's a first for everything :). And if I do do that you'd be welcome to join.   Hello! I'm looking to be part of a Star Wars game. I've played a couple of sessions of 3.5 and Pathfinder so I'm not new to Rpgs, just this one. I have yet to try out the game but I understand the dice system and the character creation (apart from the obligation point system. I need someone to help explain that to me.) For Fridays I can anywhere from 4:30pm PST to late into the night. Sundays I can go from 1:00pm to 7. So post a comment or send a message if you'd be interested in having me. Thanks for the consideration and have a wonderful day/evening.  Edit 1: Friday is filled. Sunday is still open :).   What...   alrighty, I'll send a message on skype.   I think I could do that. Could you message me some contact info so we can go into more detail?   Hello! I'm currently looking to join a weekend Pathfinder group. I've never played Pathfinder before, but I have played a few sessions of 3.5 so I believe I have the basics down. I'm open to playing any role that I'd be needed in (I don't have much experience with magic but I'm willing to learn). I'd say anytime after 4:30pm PST works best for me, and for Fridays and Saturdays I can go late into the night (I usually stay up past dawn so if you guys are operating in Europe or Asia I can be available). So just comment or message your information, and thanks for the consideration.  Edit 1: For Saturdays I'm available from 12pm PST to whenever, if that helps :)  Edit 2: Alright so it looks like I've found some groups, so unless anything happens with them I think this post is done. Thanks for the help everybody :)   child PCs? You've had someone really roll up a kid to go adventuring?    They got rid of their entire history... Dick Grayson was never a Titan, Beast Boy was never a titan, and neither were Raven, Cyborg, or Starfire. In the New 52 the Teen Titans are a newly established group.  ...Also Beast Boy is now red instead of green.   They wanted a fresh start. But while the New 52 does have a lot of good things going for it, there's a whole lot of bad decisions like this. Don't get me started on the things they did to the Teen Titans.   Yes they abandoned his Origin story of trying to find a cure for his sick wife. In the New 52 he never met his wife Nora. Instead she's just a sick women in cryostasis that Mr. Freeze became obsessed with while working at Wayne Enterprise.   How old are you?   What's the most expensive thing you've stolen?   Tell me about your fence, the guy you sell your stolen goods too.   Why are you a thief?        Man I love that gif   a few B horror movies  Dude, she starred in Halloween 4 and 5! :p   But you're right, she is fine.   How old were your victims?   How did you kill your victims?   And to think I pay these people a thousand dollars in premiums!    I would't say Jack is a Redneck; he's more of a cowboy.   Carpenter said the film bombed because of bad marketing on the studio's part :(   Her mind and spirit must be goin' north and south.     This is gonna take cracker-jack timing, Wang.   You should only worry if you haven't paid your dues, Jack.   You press 'caps lock' to speak. You should she a little microphone icon pop-up in the lower left corner.   lol, everyone thinks my name is from Naruto. I just like killerbees... :p     To me this is when the series started to become great. Don't get me wrong, the 1st season wasn't bad, it's just surpassed by all the other ones. Plus I freakin' love Mr. Turner; I was sad when he left the show.   That's Humans. I think you're thinking of the place you grew up in.     no, no, no [Spoiler](/s "kids do talk like that, I'm in High School now and kids talk about the same things in the same way and act the same [besides the assaulting part :p] I just didn't really see the kids in the story progress into madness. I mean you had the pencil scene, the girl talking about her first time, and the fight... holy shit, you did see them go crazy overtime.  Now I believe the ending.")   I love Rage, but to me the ending is just... off. [Spoiler](/s "The kids all assult Ted, and that just seemed weird. But hey, it's memorable.")  	35
 Yeah i was having surgery the next day and really rushed through fixing that stuff.   "A Touch Of Sin" and "Animal Kingdom" are both like that.   More so "A Touch Of Sin" simply because it has much more violence. It's on Netflix and it's pretty great.   	2
    Seriously love your guys stuff, I'm actually in Raleigh!! Hope you the best and brightest careers :)   You have to die in or immediately after the act of murder.   I think so too, or at least, kids have very vivid memories. So even when they don't understand something, it will eventually click with some new thing they learn and they have that aha moment   Yea in my opinion, (granted I'm 22 no kids so I have no real experience) I would think treating them like an intelligent person and telling the truth is better in the long run even though it probably won't achieve the desired effect immediately.  	5
 Guns of icarus preffered,ill still check the offers    time travel is possible but only in our dreams.lol   Well there's some old art of PA carrying omni around,and I guess blink+heal works pretty damn good as a lane combo,ill try and get the pictures tommorow morning   Cheers and good luck    You should go to /r/buildapc think its the best one for this question         Some colour on it and it will look amazing!Howd she make it?   I remember a story from school that when it came to the space race,the American science team wasted valuable time developing a pen that could be used in outer space,while the Russians skipped that and just used an ordinary pencil and got the edge from that.While it doesn't sound 100% true,still an interesting story to hear      Oh i see,sorry for that one,my mistake   I believe shocktober is currently up,with horror/zombie games   Aye,ill prolly join in by tommorow   Looking mainly for a combination of Killing Floor+Garrys Mod+ Sweets if possible,if not some combination of either two games with something else  Cheers    Even though Rockstar announced that online issues have been resolved,I still cant get into online.I managed to get twice in for maybe 10 minutes,but after that its either time put freeze screen or random kick   Ill take this offer      Would you take 1 dota key for it?    Thats croatia   ako covek daje sajkacu za snajpera ima par karata od mene!    A spent a game talking to a guy on our team who kept trying to convince me to buy propane tanks.I dont want no goddamn propane tanks.   The episode in Digimon where one of them evolves all the way into its final Angelic form to fight an enemy.The details that stuck to me were the dark castle in the background and the digimon reverting back to its first stage.Thinking now,its been more than 10 years since i watched that episode and i still remember it   As a friend of mine once said,it has always been popular to hate the government. No matter how good it is,having a rebellious attitude makes people think they are more interesting.   Story time:   During a party at a friends place,one of the friends got really,really drunk.Like he didn't know where the hell he was most of the time.At one point,i see him wondering outside and tell him lets go inside and have you sit down.  But I have to find my brother!  At this point his brother was standing next to him and looking at me trying to figure out what was going on.So I tell him:   Your brother's right here,lets go inside,he'll go there with us.  Instead of responding to that,he gives me a long stare and gives me a slap across my face.Now if he wasn't a good friend of mine and half my size,this would have ended a lot different.So i pick him up,take him inside and lay him on the couch and tell him to stay there while i go get something for him so he sobers up.   Now,as I'm walking my female best friend walks up to me and asks me why i look angry.To which i respond by explaining what happened.Now the funny part.   She starts screaming at me.Direct quotes:   You cant be fucking angry at someone thats drunk!   But im not angry at him!   Yes you fucking are i see it in your eyes!   Im slowly starting to get confused here,as I would never hurt the guy even when he was sober. Dude Im just going to go get him something to sober up   No!Youre staying right here because you will hurt him if you go there!  At this point people are gathering around and laughing due to her screaming at me and me looking confused as fuck.Later on,instead of apologizing the only thing she said was We both made mistakes then.  Thats pretty much what caused me to stop hanging out with her for some time,but alas shes still the best friend i ever had.   Watch a lot of TV and read books. Thats pretty much how i learned English as a kid,and trust me,it ends up paying off much more than you'd expect it to.   Yeah,even though i think i watched that episode more than 10 years ago,I remember patamon evolving into a big Angelic digimon to defeat the evil one(it was some sort of a dark castle theme if memory sever right)and ended up deevolving(correct me if im calling it wrong) back to the first stage.No idea how that stuck so long in my head   Quick search says http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001B4EEW4 which is pretty cheap if you ask me.      Oh bro the batteries dont go there,they go in th case which you are lacking,give me a moment to take a picture of my controler   EDIT:Here you go http://imgur.com/CWtHaia   You should contact the person that sold you the controller,you either got screwed over or it was noted in the post   Hi!Could you send in pictures?Im slightly confused about the case bit in particular   I played a lot of From Dust as i happened to get it pretty cheap (5 pounds for a 3pack).Its a pretty fun game,albeit its a bit short.Its definitely worth checking out if you enjoy god games(Black and White in particular comes to mind).I havent played the other two so i cant really say anything about them   She just has small eyes,heres a close up of her face http://thesecurewalls.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/malena-morgan-awesome.jpg   Do you only draw your own ideas or do you do drawings per request too?

    Mediocre            Copyrighting so hard right now         Actual chills         The fella with the beard is at work and asked me to respond. As a bit of back story, we all initially began our training with beards- it was kind of a gimmick for charity. He was admirably the only one who kept his throughout, and we actually shaved it off together about an hour after this picture was taken. But here's his response:    "it definitely kept me warm on a relatively cold day. Disclaimer- Not advisable for use with summer training regimen in NYC and is generally incompatible with most models of girlfriend."  Anyway, thanks for the kudos!     Ha! Who is this?   Thanks. I think I'm still smiling now.    The entire thing was memorable. Even the people who were miserable were smiling because of the crowds. The three of us ran the entire race together so we had a lot of support throughout, and we did about as well as we thought we would. If I had to pick one moment, it was coming off the Queensboro Bridge into Manhattan. The crowds, which were already massive in Brooklyn and Queens, were ENORMOUS in Manhattan. It was such a cool experience. Thanks for asking!          TL;DR, My twin brother added "I want to come on your hard tits" to my final paper in an AP history class. Teacher was a feminist.    Some of my favorites:  Ill Bambino, Sanfords, Queen's Comfort, Junkos, Bartelino's            Two time reader here. The first reading wasn't so much difficult as it was disgusting. I've read some dark stuff, but this one got to me. It wasn't until the second read that I realized how amazingly intricate and beautiful the prose was. I actually sympathized with HH and thought of the book as some great story of love and loss. Every time I mention this I get weird looks, but it has become a favorite of mine. Keep at it.    	23
 What types of things are you into? It's good to find people with similar interests to hang out with.   Look, I've been a Dolphins fan since Marino's trip to the Super Bowl. I've shared your struggles. Your hopes. I've fucked the Jets.  If you're like me, you saw a lot in Tannehill that you liked and were hopeful that he was the answer at quarterback.  But the more I watch, the more I see a guy who is just really average. He holds onto the ball too long. He has opportunities to gain some yardage on the ground, but that clock in his head doesn't seem to be working.  Trent Green was annoying during the Bills game talking about accuracy, but it's an issue. He isn't very good at hitting receivers down the field. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but every time he chucks it deep I hold my breath.  Our receivers are not an excuse. Yes we have dropped balls, but we are far better off than many teams in terms of receiver talent. And the drops...well, some of them the balls are not ideally placed. Yes, they should still be caught, but Tannehill is a part of that as well.  I hate to say it, brothers, but I think we're in for a rough ride. Get ready for a couple years of mediocrity as the organization realizes he's not the answer. Then there's maybe a house cleaning again.  Downvote me if you must. I'll be very happy to be proved wrong. FTJ   He used all caps, how could you not hear him?   I'm a day late but hoping someone can help.  Here's my situation (Drupal 6). I have a content type with a number of fields, and views to display those fields in a table.  Let's say I have a field "Fruit" and a field "Vegetable", and a view "Food" that lists these fruit and vegetable fields in a column.  What I would like is php code at the top with would count the number of instances of each type of food.  For example, at the top it might show: Apple: 4 Orange: 5 Celery: 3 etc..  Essentially it is counting the number of times "Apple" appeared in the "Fruit" column/field within that view. Same for Orange and Celery.  Is there php code that would do that?  Any help is appreciated.   Interesting...I'll give that a shot   I have no trouble dodging chargers, super easy, and am always playing against others. It's that timing that gets me...maybe it's my perception/eyes, but it's like you have to swing when they appear to be too far away to hit. I can dead stop jockeys and hunters...so I dunno.   I've always been challenged by Charger leveling. I can do it occasionally, but I definitely don't have the timing down right. I have tried the Charger custom map where you select the weapon and a charger comes at you to attempt to level.  Any tips on getting that timing down to be more consistently successful?   What would form something like that?   Hate to burst bubbles, but it's dependent on the woman, not her age. I was married to someone 9 years older than me and the sex was good, not mind-blowing.   Now divorced and slept with someone 7 years younger who fucked like a porn star.   But different pipes go to different places!   I just think a lot of people don't find it to be a challenge.   Years? Lol! This whole thread just became meaningless.   I wasn't commenting about you, rather your teammates if you're getting overwhelmed. Pros can be overwhelmed if teammates are not helping.  That necessary level of attention is one of the reasons why I love the game.  If you ever want to play my username is Endif. I'm mostly on evilmania's vs servers and scavenge.   Sounds like you need better teammates :)  If other survivors aren't paying attention to their teammates then being overwhelmed can happen fairly easily.   That's actually my biggest frustration with multiplayer and this game. It's such a well done co-op that if your mates aren't helping each other you're doomed -- so newbie players can really drag the game down. This is why there are so many kicks. It's better to have a bot than someone not helping and doing their own thing.   This is a common tactic in the software industry, not just gaming. You release your product knowing there are likely things to fix, and your users help identify those.  On some level I agree. Companies should put in the effort to properly test and correct first. The flip side, though, is even then they wouldn't catch everything. Some ingenious gamer will find an exploit, or the sheer volume of players would identify one, or a glitch.  All that said, the melee buffer made the game more realistic and enjoyable IMHO. The game is very focused on balance, and infinite melee was an unfair advantage as seen by the majority of players.

Taking your time to write that was very cool.   Ok, Seddit, I could use some help.  First, been divorced for about a year, 38 years old. I've been working on "me" by exercising regularly which has helped me feel better about myself. In general, I do feel pretty good (at least I think so). I have a good job, intelligent enough, I've been told I'm attractive, and in ok shape (not where I'd like to be yet). I am tall and thin.  From my experiences with online dating so far, I feel there's a huge plus for men with interesting and exciting lives or hobbies, but that's not my life right now. I work, go home, exercise, eat, sleep, repeat. Due to the divorce I don't have much money for other things (even though I make good money).  Conversely, I really like spending time with women (sure, no fucking surprise there) and would be pretty darn happy just "hanging out" with a girlfriend. I don't feel the need for dynamic events or activities.  There's one woman I've been seeing periodically, but due to conflicting schedules I don't see her much. And given my desire for meaningful human contact, this can cause some anxiety -- but no way in hell am I having the "define our relationship" talk.  I could use a few things from the generous souls here. 1) A fucking pep talk. Not being with someone can make me feel pretty down, which admittedly is a part of my problem. 2) Some ideas for cheap but exciting hobbies. 3) Help me deflate my approach anxiety by giving me ideas on the easiest places and ways to approach women. If I start there maybe everywhere else will become easier.  Appreciate it gents. Endif   Weekdays schmeekdays. Why can't a man get a 2 dollar beer on a weekend anymore.   Where the hell can I get a $2 beer?   What exactly are we to discuss? Strategies?   I like that. I'm going to look into it. Thanks!    Burlington, Vermont.   Thanks!   Not quite, but nice try. I did decide to skip it. I'm not closed minded, just looking for something I'm going to like and is quality.  Careful with assumptions.   That one looks very cool. Is this a common configuration I could get elsewhere?   Thanks for the info.   I really appreciate everyone's feedback. I'm going to keep looking around as quality is important, but I'm really just interested in having some fun with it, so I want it to look fun to me...that may be "tacticool" but I'm still learning about all this.   Unfortunately I missed the memorial sale at Palmetto for the AR uppers (300). My intention was to get that and then a lower locally, but the uppers sold out.  Thanks again Redditors.    Ruger 10/22  I'm prepared for the downvotes, but that rifle just doesn't look like one I want to own. I know...I know...but I'd like something that looks cool to me.   Hi all,  I've never owned a gun and am considering purchasing this: http://palmettostatearmory.com/index.php/firearms/rifles/umarex-h-k-mp5a5-22lr-2245250.html  I'm not looking to hunt, just go shooting at the range with a rifle. While I'm not picky, I'd like it to look cool - lame I know, but it's my first gun, cut me some slack :)  Ammo for this is 22 which my understanding can be challenging to get, but I feel it's doable in my area (Vermont) enough that it wouldn't be an issue. I wouldn't go to the range but once or twice a month at the most.  So, is this a good rifle? What's the quality like?  Thanks for any help to a newbie.   So nothing to do with her body size and everything to do with her laziness. Got it.   Ex-wife's family only did this...   More of this, please.      This needs to happen.   That came across as very self-important.   This disgusted me. It turned into how he was doing something wrong when she is the one that changed. He's a good man for dealing with her.    Somebody needs to secretly record her workouts for a while and post them online to call her out on her bullshit. I guarantee she doesn't work out either very much or very well.    Yes, Seahawks have character.    This assumes they go to the gym. Randi would be sitting there alone.   An old philosophical question. If no one is there to see the fatty run on the treadmill. Did he/she actually run on the treadmill?   Harvard is an interesting example to us for this argument. My understanding is most students get significant aid from their endowment.  But let's face it, most professors make no where near that, so this one example isn't indicative of the problem.    All I've ever had is Windows :(   As in the monolith?   I was going to do this from a screenshot from the Shining (love Kubrick) but after seeing this I'm reconsidering.  I like how you incorporated another color.   #1 ingredient.   You pee out those calories.   Thank you for that. Cliff Notes to tragedy.   Their response would be "I promote intuitive eating. If I feel like eating Cheetos that's my body telling me to eat Cheetos and my body wouldn't tell me to do something unhealthy, that just doesn't make sense. Also, because of the way my body works, it doesn't matter if I eat Cheetos or celery, I'll gain weight. Now, GET OUT OF MY LIFE."   Was this post for a "dumbest person on Earth" contest?   Thank you. I needed this.   Yes, this. What you are responding to is a distraction from the point.    If only there had been some sort of warning.    This. As a hiring manager. This.   Have we gotten to the point where that is "small fat"?  If so, holy crap!   My guess is it wasn't right away, but next day or two due to constipation.    I'll take her then.   Is that a rhetorical question?   That's a lot of semen.   This is why I'm for taxing unhealthy food. You want to eat yourself to death? Fine, but I'm not paying for your poor choice.  And I'm very liberal, happy to pay taxes for those who have fallen on hard times, but this is silly.    Agreed, very sad. A few years from now when she has disease after disease she'll look back with a kit if regret.    Not a lot of attractions but you'll find amazing local food, some of the world's best beers, winter sports, and generally friendly people in a clean and safe environment.   If you're into the movement to ficus locally (rather than chain restaurants, and mass produced everything) you'll fit in.  If you want Broadway, big city, national sports, long warm days, then you'll probably hate it.    "Love" is the appropriate word here.   How old does a rash have to be to call it an "old rash"? To me that sounds like she's had it for years...I bet it's a yeast infection between her folds.   Why is she even allowed to give medical advice? That's a big "no-no" and could get multiple people in trouble, including Tumblr.   I still haven't seen a ufo. So pissed.    Checks out.    Just like it's not binge drinking if you're an alcoholic. Doctors are wrong!   It's ok because the wealthy don't like fiats anyway.    Notice he didn't thank the current staff...

 Wasn't aware of that.  With that being said should it really be required for construction zones all to have a police detail?  Will a flagger suffice?  And what about projects like road paving?  The construction company might pay for the cop, but they count that into what they charge to do the job, which would be footed by the taxpayers, right?   I think the benefit of a cop presence on certain construction zones is a good thing, like fast moving traffic areas like highways.  The lights can bring attention to drivers who then slow down, making it safer for workers  But it is absurd that they are required at every single construction site regardless of what it is and where it is.    I don't even take issue with cops making a ton of money working overtime, just not for BS reasons like when someone is replacing a man hole cover.     I was trying to come off not as a badass, just trying to frame it that I had some knowledge on how to throw a punch and defend yourself.  But everyone it appears took it as me trying to sound tough.  Oh well whatya gonna do?   I'd be more interested in finding out how much it costs to have police detail on every single construction site, regardless of how big or small the operation is or if it gets a lot or no traffic.   I very well might I haven't even hired an employee yet so all these things are far into the future.   Drunk squirrel who had too many fermented crabapples.  http://youtu.be/LAfKZUn9sZ0   I have done a little boxer training and I'm by no means any good but I would mop the floor with that one guy.  Coming in with his fist so high, even if he connected he wouldn't be able to get power on it.  Plus you duck down and throw a quick upper cut, that dudes done.   This is what I'm talking about, I want employees to feel like I can trust them to get their shit done on their own and treat them like adults rather than micro manage them.   More money elsewhere, match fixing scandals, and loss of champions league spot.   Yeah all good points and that has occurred to me see my other comment where I expanded somewhat on my overall goal for the workplace.   Unlimited vacation means what I mean it to mean.  Perhaps I implement a required minimum use of vacation, maybe I start with 6 weeks of vacation, I don't really know.  Unlimited sick days however definitely doesn't mean no sick days.  If someone is sick I don't want them to feel compelled to come in and 1. Get other people sick and 2. Take the time to recover.  I'm on an iPad so it's a pain to go into depth on it, but take all the things I'm suggesting and see I'm trying to build a culture and environment that provides a positive outlet for people's creativity without burning them out.  There is more to life than doing the same mundane job over and over and I want to try and challenge people while also allowing them to live a fulfilling life.   Whatever we are happy with our multiple NFC championship game appearances. (Not really)  	12
 Try it.      Your photography is sick. It's great to see you reach out to your fans like this. Rock on, man!   WAS GETTING CAUGHT PART OF YOUR PLAN?   Thanks for that. Exactly what I've been thinking every time I go back to this.   I noticed you've got a track up too. I'll check it out in a bit!   Do you mean the delivery itself, or the effects put on it? I'll be honest; back when I did this, it was the first time I ever did vocals on one of my tracks, so I've got a lot of work to do there.    [MCON - Dogs of War](https://soundcloud.com/maazcon/dogs-of-war)   This is the first and only full song I've completed so far. I'd love some feedback from you guys on it while I'm working on newer tracks. Just hearing what others think helps me out.   It's got an amazing drumline, man. I think it'd sound incredible if you highered your bass when the vocals hit.   I'm really feeling the sample. Try toning it down just a bit though, so your drums can get heard more clearly!   Naw you good brotha   Star Wars is actually coming out in December of that year. BvS's competition would most likely be The Avengers and Jurassic World.   Hey, guys. I'm the original artist behind the picture. I'm still building a website to put my full portfolio, so I don't exactly have one yet, but you can check out my [Instagram](http://instagram.com/maazcon) for now.   I didn't realize this was getting posted in other subreddits until now. It's awesome to see it get this much feedback. I'll be back with more. Thank you guys!   You guys are awesome. Don't think i forgot to answer the rest of you; I'll be back soon. Thanks so much for the feedback!   I've got a it at a higher resolution on the website. I still can't guarantee it'll be the best quality because the source image had to be more blown up, but It shouldn't have any artifacts. I put up the [print of it here](http://i.imgur.com/mlueCDW.jpg) so you can test it out before going for it. If anyone's a bit uneasy about this, I'd say to check that link because it's the size for the poster. And if anyone has tips on correcting anything, then tell me as soon as possible because I can update the site before anything ships if it's soon enough. Thanks!   Year Zero was all that was playing in my head while making this.   Just put it up on Society6. This is the only way I have so far for selling artwork, so I'm sorry if the prices are a bit high. If anyone knows about a better way to distribute prints, please let me know.   http://society6.com/maazcon/the-airstrike_print#1=45   No way? I literally just titled my last piece "The Radiator" ten minutes ago.   That's a really cool way to look at it. It reminds me of the way the camera messes up at the [end of this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRCR6onaASU).   I do if people ask!  I have a [shop up on society6.com](http://society6.com/maazcon) where I sell a few, but I can't speak for how good it'll come out since I don't make the prints myself. The prices there are also a bit on the high end so I'm sorry for that in advance.   If anyone knows a better way to distribute prints, then please let me know.  But until then, I'll be putting the artwork up there as soon as it's ready!   I do this thing where I take a picture of something mundane and try making something out of it. Whatever I've got in my head at the point, I try making it look like that. So this one started off as a picture of a telephone pole outside my house. And for me it ended as the view of a city under attack.   But you probably saw something different, and that doesn't make you understand this any less! I'd rather you saw it your own way, because that's just awesome to think about.   It makes me happy that this got to be the exception! Thanks, buddy.   NAW YOU FUCKING MAGNIFICENT.   This one's by me. I'm still working on a website for a portfolio, so I don't really have a page I put my work up on. The closest thing I can give is my [Instagram](http://instagram.com/maazcon) feed for now.  I'm really glad you like it!       Let it go with this one, man. There's an entire army of users like him who raid these posts to spread bullshit like that. It's why the top comments are all just people trying to say that the civilians and their children were asking for it.    **THE EMPIRE**   Absolutely! I've had most of my work on there up for about a year now. It won't go away.   Thanks for that. I'm really glad that these are being received so well! It started off as procrastinating from studying and now I just want to make more.    Now I just feel guilty. First time I played that game I gave in..         His stuff was mainly what I was going through while doing this. I was trying to give it mix of her style with Yoji Shinkawa's.    Would you mind sharing a screenshot? I want to see how it looks!  Thanks for the feedback on it!   Hey! I just tried uploading it right now, but minus restricts the upload size to 15 MB. Mine was at 19 MB, which was just shy of Imgur's 20.   I did put it up on my Google Drive, though, if you want to download the original!   https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7e3dIf4j0UgZlprTk9XN1k4N0E/edit?usp=sharing   Yup! [Here's the link to this one.](http://society6.com/maazcon/tactical-espionage-action_print#1=45)  Just a note: I'm not really in the business of selling work right now; I usually put my work up if someone requests to buy it. Problem is that I currently don't have my own way to sell them, so I use Society6. If there's anyone out there that knows a more accessible way to  sell these prints, please let me know.  For now, I hope this way works out fine!   I'll get you a nexus sized one in just a bit!    You have no idea how happy I got from reading that! I was trying to make it look like a Criterion Collection cover.    Yellow/Green tint   Trent Reznor   Movie title in Futura Font  Fincherness: 10/10         The year is 2014. I'll call it Porschey.   SHOTS FIRED SHOTS FIRED   ART is love, ART is life.   SHIT SON TWO GOALS IN FIVE MINUTES  edit: multitasking   Hey, man. Please send me a message. I want know more about you. Let's talk.    The scene with the Inferi deserved that PG-13 rating more than almost anything in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.      I was in Mecca recently, at the shops outside Masjid al Haram. There's guards posted up there outside the entrance to every building. Each of them just have a stern posture that makes them seem as unapproachable as any stereotypical guard you might think of.   I'm walking past and see a frail old man walking up to the one of the mall's entrances. The guard there immediately broke his stance and smiled at the old man as he passed by. He smiled back. Not that big of a deal, but seeing respect like that made my day.   not with that attitude   I think you need to relax a bit. I posted this as a warning to be careful because of things like this, and not to rely on Sony if you screw up because they won't help you at all.  Go back and show me where I put the blame on Sony for any of this, because you're the one twisting my words up here.    I made sure to look up everything about the phone when it came to its warranty. Xperia phones have an international warranty, as long as you have a proof of purchase of the phone from the country it was sold in.   What happened here was that my phone was shipped from the factory itself, and any phone that comes out of the factory and not from a Sony store is absolutely void of any warranty. Normally you'd be right here, but my phone has no warranty even in the country in which it was sold.     http://i.imgur.com/9wxz6Q2.jpg  Here's the best picture I could get of it. It comes off completely clean. I think the port was glued to it with an adhesive. There's no damage done to any of the parts.    It does have an international warranty. As long as you have the proof of purchase and what country the phone's originally from, the warranty still runs.  The problem is that my phone ended up being one of the phones that was shipped directly from a Sony factory instead of a Sony store. In the representative's words, the factory models come without any warranty.   But the TLW you linked seems like it should apply here regardless. I'll try contacting them again and bring it up.    This entire ordeal really made me appreciate whenever I've dealt with Apple. I've had iPods replaced free of charge even if they were a bit past their warranty expiration. Sending a device in for a diagnostic didn't mean paying a fee, either.  Sony's got great phones, but it won't gain any new customers with support like this.    I recently purchased a Z1 Compact online from the US, since it isn't sold here. I bought it brand new from a seller through Newegg.com, and after using it for two months, the magnetic charging port got pulled out by the charging dock itself.   Now, I've already been taking extra caution with my phone; dealing with overseas shipping for repairs or replacements would be another hassle on its own. This phone hasn't had a scratch on it since I've gotten it, and of all things that ended up defective, it was the magnetic charging port.  I called technical support, and I was told that my phone had no warranty at all after giving the IMEI number because it was from a Hong Kong factory. I've searched everywhere online for this policy, and I haven't found anything about it. I was told to send it in for an evaluation (with a $25 fee) to figure out how much it would cost to repair it.  When I asked the rep if there's any way at all for a Sony center in the US to help me out with repairing the phone, her response was:  "That is actually something that we don't (but should) have access to. Sony has not compiled a map or even a list of authorised locations for Sony Repair."  The Z1 Compact is a great phone, but the sad reality is that owning one in the US means you'll barely have support for it at all. There's a lot of people out there that want to buy the Z2, as well, so I just wanted to give this as a warning: wherever you buy it from, make sure it's coming officially through Sony. They're incredibly strict as it is when it comes to warranty, and if you're not covered, you're going to end up paying for everything.  And if you do get it from a reseller online, most of them offer their own warranties hat cover accidental damage, as well. BUY THE COVERAGE. Now that I'm finding out my Z1 Compact has absolutely no warranty from Sony at all, I'm regretting not getting the reseller's coverage while I had the chance.  **TL;DR: If you're in the US, be careful when buying an Xperia Z1/Compact/Z2 from overseas. Get any third-party warranty coverage if you can. Don't ever rely on Sony for warranty support, and put a case on that phone as soon as you get it.**   RUN EVERYBODY RUN MONSTER   I think the men who have their lives for the city in this gunfight amount for something.    One look at this guy's [submission history](http://www.reddit.com/user/LongDongFuk/submitted/?sort=top#page=2) is enough.   	57
 Sometimes I think I can...  	1
 Cuntpuncher knows what's up   Sick delts   My wanna *nip* that biting thing in the butt before it gets bad.   That was fucking hilarious   Some of these are absolutely baffling   You'd be surprised by people that vote on legacy.    I agree that his economic stance is just horrendous - but I really don't think Paul has a good chance at winning, and my ONLY reason for thinking that is because he'll be running under the republican ticket. The republican party has done a well and thorough job of making themselves look even worse than the democrats, which is his downfall.   They control congress so it's not out of question. However the dems seem to be the sexier party nowadays. It's unfortunate honestly, because Rand, Justin Amash, and Thomas Massie are very good Republicans. Bernie is the only Dem I see that is making waves with integrity. Hillary will win the primary, she'll go against bush and a battle of legacy will ensue, Hillary will win. Or against Walker and Hillary will still win because he is just a run of the mill republican and the country won't vote for that.  Well, a candidate needs funds to get the message out there. Many times have otherwise good candidates been outspent by horrible candidates that take tons of money.    If Paul goes against Hillary he may win.    I understand where you're coming from, as I've considered it myself. But I absolutely can't support his ridiculous stance on the economy that will do more damage to our country than his integrity will do good. We've had good people that were bad presidents, ex Jimmy Carter, and it won't set any gears in motion that will create good presidents in the future. Plus, he won't get along with congress either because of how belligerent he is.   Rand Paul is the best bet at the moment. A candidate must take contributions from corporations in order to even compete and Rand Paul is on par with Sanders in terms of integrity, but with better views. I pay very close attention to Paul and his campaign, he is the best for the job. Either way, his tax plan isn't very friendly to large subsidized corporations and neither is his foreign policy plan for military contracting companies.    Zoe Barnes. Back on track. Lol.  I think she was quite *on track* the last time we saw her!   Sometimes I wish he didn't have such fucked views of the economy.    In the wise words of wooden bender: "We shall show the world our peaceful ways... by force!"   I'm not a fan of the short hair in general. But you have a great face   *swoon*   I'd just let it be honestly. I wouldn't want to put the strain on your relationship, she likely wasn't going to do it.   *slightly*   That was amazing. Great read   Wait, cycling creatine? Am I doing it wrong for drinking a scoop a day?   Got deleted what was it lol   More like comic book supervillain.   I really enjoy the Bulletins.    Nice traps!   I think part of it is that he got rid of the pedo stache, and grew out his hair.   This needs to happen. QUICK, EVERYONE (respectfully) TWEET AT JOSH.   Daaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyhyyyyyyyyyyyyuuuuuuuuuuyuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm gurl.   That's really not a good thing to do. People could get killed.   Nothing will be locked behind a paywall. You can earn everything in game by playing. And the revenue goes toward HCS prize pools, so imo there isn't a downside.   Man, Laura Bailey is hot as fuck    Honestly it's all a good thing. This is just another aspect that will keep people playing the game longer. I just hope there is forge with 24 players and customs is good.   There New Mombasa levels were going to be huge. Like really really huge. Open world   YES. FUCKING YES.    I... I... didn't think this was possible.   It'd probably be better. Both halo 1 and 2 are the PC versions, and they already ported the h3 engine for halo online   Well, he WAS dealing with the Chief.   I can hope.... I can hope for some beautiful Halo 4 environments in 4k and funny mods.   I mean, it blatantly says Halo: The Master Chief Collection with a pic of Chief in a graphic that showcases Windows 10.    I was referring to this image. http://pbs.twimg.com/media/B6NK-DPIAAA3i_D.jpg   I really don't want anymore re-releases of any kind. More spin off games will do just fine.   Oh c'mon.   Why?   Rekt   This wouldn't be the first time they've teased it so if they were going to do it, they'd just wait until windows 10 releases in all of its glory.   This is a pretty clever thought      It's come full circle.    - Bungie = Cord rope thing - Highwire = Cord rope thing  Conspiracy amirite!?   The world is so against us!    Arby is literally the best at everything. Best sanghelli ever.   He is rivaled only by The Arbiter himself.   Nice. How was Vale as a character?    Did you read it? How is it?   Ah so it's not Mendicant?   I thought they confirmed that all alien AIb were enemies.   I just want a falcon or hornet   So are they team based? Or friendly to all humans?   Where did you see that halo 5 has lacking graphics? The full game will be 1080p 60fps. The most likely reason behind 24 players is design and balance choices, not graphical capabilities.   I thought it was fucking awesome. His dialogue was chilling. Halo has always been influenced by epic tales of myth, especially the forerunners.   Ewwww   Motion Capture production    I agree with you, but it really goes to show how subjective art really is. Even when it's with something so seemingly obvious such as color scheme.   Will warzone be forgeable and custom games viable? What specific gamemodes will be in Warzone? So Spartan Ops isn't making a return? Can we get any gameplay of Warzone?   Hype. Hype. Hype. I can't wait to see gameplay, also I want to see if it's all customizable for custom games.  Edit: why the fuck am I being downvoted for asking whether this shit will be customizable in customs? An wanting to see gameplay.    I was dying. *gahhhhh I regret everything*   Oh my. Oh my.   I will be over the moon if a new BioShock is announced   Freedoms aren't a privilege, they are a right.    ONI suppressed Ben by laying the truth out at his feet, then embarrassing him, discrediting him, and labeling him a terrorist. The truth is still out there, and Petra isn't as sloppy as Ben.    Solid 9. Brows on point, face on point. Need body pics   *Are you from Tennessee? Cuz you're the only 10 I see!*  *Are you a campfire? Cuz baby I want s'more!*  I crack myself up.    I am no ONI sympathizer, and they are bad. But at the time they let the chief take the fall for them. They did clear his name and work to bring the real perpetrators to justice and patch things up with the sanghelli. Devious criminal masterminds? Yes. Traitors? No.    Honestly a 1/10   I bet the "warrant" doesn't even exist!   Exactly 343. Make it happen.   Tomorrow.   It'd be sick as fuck. Like the conference is just going on as normal, Dan is up on stage. Then BOOM power goes out, static, then Petra appears on screen. I doubt it though   That was fucking great   All Sapien Sunrise stuff   Honestly, 343 did a good job at fooling all of us that ONI could be that sloppy. I mean, a fucking shed on a glassed planet? How could we have not known. It's typical ONI deception. I'm thinking Petra will patch into the E3 conference tomorrow.       He does her interviews. I watch them all on his YouTube   And she's a vessel for dealing with his own mortality and existence.   I nominate that last quote as quote of the month   What are the chances of a Iso-Didact return? Especially with Cortana saying: "The Domain is open, the reclamation has begun"    So the Domain wasn't destroyed? I'd also go to say the flood is coming back full force. But... who has the Domain? Halsey and Jul? The Guardians?   I like the way he builds things.    I remember my one buddy **absolutely** hating halo 1, but I got him to play a couple games with me, next thing I hear "Ehh that was pretty fun"   My GT is ZeALoTT if you want to play some h1   It's something you have to get used to. I never played it originally but then picked it up on MCC and loved it. You just have to learn the game and how to shoot a pistol. It's also possible you just got unlucky with god opponents.   Wait, where are you getting that the UNSC and UEG would collapse without ONI?    I was the 117th vote.  Yis   You didn't have no choice to quit. You only quit because you were getting smacked hard. That's not 343's fault, that's yours. And it's certainly not H1's fault.    I think you're going a little overboard. The game is pretty fun once you get used to it, it's halo in its purest form, and was really meant for 2v2 fun couch gameplay. Plus, the pistol is the BR in that game, I really don't see a problem with it. To be honest I think you just suck at it so you hate it for the reasons you suck.  The game has the widest skill gap out of any halos   Yeah, fuck Tam Brody   Bungie did amazing with the art in both Reach and ODST   These statements are fine for the most part. But people tend to fail to understand underlying causes. Most of the time it's not corporate greed.   Dude, you seriously have my goal physique.    1. How old are you?   2. Nice chest.   3. You have a great physique. Nobody cares about the scar.   Better be hittin them lower abs girl.  8/10   Are you m or f   Grow some self confidence   Only much more rude. Johnson was brash but likable, Palmer is just overbearing.   Blue team is only using GEN 1.   net   Safety time. Time for safety   Why? The flood are easily the most perilous threat to the galaxy.    Yeah, were they voiced by Joe Staten? (Sound identical to Bungies grunts)   The government poses a bigger threat to the internet than businesses. The government enables the businesses to fuck us over.   It doesn't work that way. Sorry.    I think everyone on this sub is following it. It's simply amazing   Amazing change.  	107

 good one.   It sounds like you know what you want; go ahead, you have the internet's permission to pursue that. You have no obligation to him now, but keep in mind he has no obligation to you later.   The /Filmcast is the most obsessively anti-spoiler environment out there; if someone mentions Rosebud in passing, Chen will almost certainly interrupt with "Spoilers for Citizen Kane!" They have spoilers for their main reviews clearly delineated at the end, and you can avoid it with next to no effort if you haven't seen a film yet.   This might be a sort of extreme strategy, but it always helps me to remember that I'm **going to fucking die.** So are you--you're getting older by the minute, you're smoking, you're not exercising enough, you don't have long for this world. If you're like most people, I imagine the concept is fairly abstract and intangible to you, but I would encourage you obsess over it a little bit, really *feel* the inevitability of it. If you're struck dead by a car on your way to buy cigarettes, what's going to be left of you creatively? An unfinished first draft? An outline? An idea you never told anyone about? What ever you're afraid of right now, it should pale in comparison to what's in store. Here lies Stan, he was defined by what he consumed. Fuck a deadline, this is *real life* and it's your only shot to make something. Do it now.   good advice! this is the first time I ever used a shaker in a recording, so I was basically just trying it out here without knowing much about how to mix or arrange for it. Thanks for weighing in!   Rain.      Pfft spend ten minutes in this subreddit, everybody hates everybody.      Plenty of Catholics in the Midwest, boss. Michigan ex-auto workers, Chicago Irish, Notre Dame, etc.   Huh, I live about a block away. Small world.   I think they're very different skills, and I think anyone can do either poorly. It's silly to compare the lowest form of one skill to the highest form of another.   That's a rather condescending view of cinematography. Anybody can write shit down and call it a script, too, but while anyone *can* perform any production duty, everyone onset should have some degree of skill, practice and talent.   Just from an English/Grammar perspective, everything after "cost" in the last sentence is redundant. Also, it's generally considered bad form to end a clause in a preposition -- "a world in which she doesn't belong" is more correct than "a world she doesn't belong in. Also, these two sentences say essentially the same thing--woman enters high-risk situation to save husband--and could be combined without too much trouble.  I also think it's important to clarify whose addiction is ripping apart everything she's ever loved in the first sentence, as it currently reads as though Monica's addiction leads her to the brink of addiction in order to solve her addiction, which is a bit of a head-scratcher.   Also, "rip apart everything she's ever loved" is kind of generically melodramatic; I think you're better off concisely setting up the specific stakes of your story. People love an awful lot of things; if it's her marriage or her family or her parents or her hometown at risk then say so--those words are technically smaller in scope, but carry a lot more emotional resonance, and are almost certainly more accurate.    Frankly, no, people shouldn't have to change who they are for the sake of others.  That's completely sociopathic.   Sure, why not? I mean hell, it sounds like it pushed some boundaries, it got stuck in your head, and it made you reconsider your assumptions on a subject you care about--that's a pretty effective work of art no matter how you slice it.   Yeah, ignorance, that's what I said.   Are you really justifying ignorance by saying that you have a gay friend? Are you running for office or something?   No, just kidding um  Hm, that's a hard one. No that  Didn't come out right.   I always picture Rob Stark acting these out.   fair point.   There are smart ways and dumb ways to engage with that material. For the most part, GTA games are smart, which is a big part of why they're beloved by critics and why the word "satire" pops up in reviews so often. With respect to gender, however -- an issue that affects somewhere between 50 and 100% of the world in a big way -- they didn't live up to their own standards of insight, and that was a problem for the reviewer.  My point, however, was that Blawraw busted out "transexual feminist" as if the reviewer's gender identity ended the conversation, which is at best ridiculous and at worst pretty bigoted. If sexuality has nothing to do with it, then why are so many GTA fanboys bringing it up?   yeah ok buddy   You've chosen writing people off based on their sexuality because it's easier, thanks for playing.   I read it yes.   On a less positive note, its deeply frustrating that, while its central and supporting male characters are flawed and complex characters, with a few extremely minor exceptions (such as the aforementioned optional getaway driver), GTA V has little room for women except to portray them as strippers, prostitutes, long-suffering wives, humorless girlfriends and goofy, new-age feminists were meant to laugh at.    Characters constantly spout lines that glorify male sexuality while demeaning women, and the billboards and radio stations of the world reinforce this misogyny, with ads that equate manhood with sleek sports cars while encouraging women to purchase a fragrance that will make them smell like a bitch. Yes, these are exaggerations of misogynistic undercurrents in our own society, but not satirical ones. With nothing in the narrative to underscore how insane and wrong this is, all the game does is reinforce and celebrate sexism.  The reviewer thinks that in a game that leans this heavily on social satire, it's lazy to just uncritically present destructive social attitudes without engaging in them. The extent to which this is a problem for you will vary, but in this reviewer's subjective opinion it detracted pretty significantly from what the game was in accordance with its own ambitions.   Because you've played it through and prepared a counterargument? Or because writing off people based on their sexuality is easier?   The thing is though, if you hate hearing the same old shit over and over again as a layperson, just imaging being in her shoes. All the witless jokes about her appearance every time someone disagrees with her, the self-righteous dittoheading about how she should ease up on feminism, and the *bizarre* anti-intellectual notion that critics shouldn't engage with ideas in games they review -- i imagine that shit *redefines* draining. She's given her life to a medium she loves and engages with it though principles she cares about -- if that's not how you live your life then that's fine, but just know that you and everyone else railing against feminism, fiction and *fucking thought in general* are smaller people because of it.   It is surprisingly good. Who said it's better than the original?   It has it's ups and downs, I think about half of it is great and half isn't.   Made by the co-creator of Home Movies and starring the voice of Coach McGuirk   "Make an oreo" is fucking stupid, too. Oreos come in boxes, and nobody makes one cookie. This joke was like 10% thought through.      thanks! :)         Given the level of semantic nitpickery that got us into this conversation, I think we should at least allow the author the restrictions explicitly laid out in his initial sentence -- if you privilege the word popular all out of proportion, then Jesus probably wins. So, nix the Beatles and the About.com list of classical composers, and stick with "composers," "American," and the "popular music" genre. I would happily include Sousa and Duke Ellington in a list of popular composers, and I wouldn't be terribly surprised to see them win a popular vote. I think we're all in agreement that "one of" would have fixed the sentence; I'm only saying that Berlin's body of work makes the hyperbole understandable, if not technically justifiable.   Do you think consensus would form around someone else though? Assuming you hold people to a specific definition of popular American music composer, the only other songwriter I could see having a shot at it would be Brian Wilson, while other opinions would splinter in a million different directions. People less inclined toward pop music history probably wouldn't agree on much, while more informed people will gather around greats like Berlin.  It was still an improperly literal word choice on the writer's part, of course, but I do think Irving Berlin could win a popular vote.   You're really blowing the lid off the whole system here, man. I'll never look at historical fiction the same way again.   I kind of feel like news stories aren't really news stories when they have question marks in them.   Aw, that's sweet. Any idea when that was sent?   Tropic Thunder's great satire; so are The Cable Guy and Zoolander. He's been a wildcard on my list of favorite/most interesting directors for a while, so I'm really hoping this turns out well.   It's a contraction Bob, take it easy.   Exactly, he's Stringer Bell in The Wire universe too, that doesn't mean he never acts again.   [Yeah, this guy's an idiot.](http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html)   !   Are you saying that because you have data on the matter, or because you've just never asked your professors about their research?   The content of this article is interesting and helpful, but I'm downvoting it because its been taken from its original context and transplanted to a personal blog, with a link trying to sell some pseudo-scientific treatment crap at the bottom. If you were to link to the original mayo clinic page without the stupid title, I would upvote that.   This is r/psychology, an evidence-based scientific approach to depression is preferred to a broadly philosophical one.   I was particularly won over by the idea of a parade; I hope there's floats and cotton candy and clowns.      I generally avoid the word "swag," but it seems appropriate here.   Hmm. I have a significantly different impression of how Kevin Smith thinks about himself. I'm not a Smith apologist by any stretch, but his podcast is one of several I listen to, and he's always entirely candid about the fact that he considers himself a writer/storyteller far more than a filmmaker in any real sense. His handling of Cop Out was pretty childish, he has a tendency to pander to the lowest common denominator of his fan base, and I do get the sense that he's been living in a success bubble for quite some time, but it's a pretty blatant exaggeration to say that he considers himself a "great" filmmaker while Clerks is "so poor it's great." I think he's best considered as an inarguably major figure of the 90s indie renaissance most notable for his screenwriting, and trying to measure him against Kubrick and Bergman doesn't make much sense, particularly when I don't see any indication that he invites such comparison.   It's obviously cool that you did something uncomfortable to help out your friend, but it's also pretty cool that you didn't half-ass the man-kiss. Everybody wins, well done.

You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make. You can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you wont know for twenty years! And you may never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce  And they say theres no fate, but there is, its what you create. And even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead, or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain wasting years for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right, but it never comes. Or it seems to, but it doesnt really.  So you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along, something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel cherished, something to make you feel loved. And the truth is is, I feel so angry! And the truth is, I feel so fucking sad! And the truth is, Ive felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long, Ive been pretending Im okay, just to get along!  I dont know why. Maybe becauseno one wants to hear about my miserybecause they have their own.  Fuck everybody. Amen.   I was just thinking about the fact that pretty much everyone is fooling themselves about something, and that I probably am as well. It's obviously a tricky question to answer, but what total falsehoods do you think you might be clinging to, and why?   Should we ever be bound by uncompromising ideological absolutes?

I always thought of the original image as far "cooler" than the red warmth of this treatment--if I'd colorized it, I'd have put them all under blue lights.   [I did.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_\(video_game\)#Story_and_characters) The only references to any malevolence on Mario's part are the claims that D.K. is his pet and was mistreated, but there's no citation on that and it's not evident in the game, plus there's no ambiguity in the fact that he's rescuing her. He *is* the antagonist of the game's sequel *Donkey Kong Jr.* though, maybe that's what you were thinking of?   Why do you think that? She screams "Help" when Donkey Kong takes her and then has a love heart appear when Jumpman rescues her.   Forget "Revolution 9" and "Wild Honey Pie" (both fun experiments that remain surprisingly listenable if you give them a chance), the absolute worst Beatles song is ["Don't Pass Me By,"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSd4evT8Nw8) written by Ringo for the White Album. It's not just that the lyrics are dull and stupid, though there's that, but the arrangement and production seem like a deliberate assault on good taste. If there's an elivator down to Hell, this song is playing on it 24/7.  I quite like "Octopus's Garden" though.   My name's Ted, I'm a dude, and you're right, it's not about me: sometimes one should try to empathize with other people who have different experiences than one's own.   What does her physical design matter?  I'm not trying to bust your balls here, but you're asking that question because you've never played a game where the male hero was sexualized in a way that wasn't empowering. That's the male experience with video games, and the images of this post provide some insight into the female experience with games: sexualization in an unempowering way that has no practical benefit in the game world. Physical design is meaningless to you because you're in a position of privelege, but it's not meaningless to everyone and that's the point. It's just kind of a weird, off-putting trope that makes half the world kind of uncomfortable.  On your other points, Tomb Raider is a really fun game in spite of the creepiness surrounding Lara's design. Those seven polygons seem to have struck a chord with designers and audiences, because Croft's tits have dominated the series ever since, and it just seems unnecessary.   That's the point: males are often empowered by masculine sexuality, females are often objectified by feminine sexuality. I don't have an easy answer to that, but I think it's probably valuable for men to empathize a little by experiencing sexuality the way female gamers do.   That's a very insightful post. I'm not so much objecting to super-masculine escapist protagonists--though I do think they're often kind of silly and boring--but it is a little more troubling that female characters are so often degraded by their sexuality rather than empowered by it. Including normal women--hell, pretty women if you like--invites a far wider audience than the usual tit-flaunting girls who never wear jackets. Also, I'm more interested in games that aspire to be more than escapism and don't need Conan-like protagonists. I'm not trying to deprive escapism from people who enjoy it, but I'd like to see a larger market share of inclusive games that don't lean on sexuality so hard.   There's a significant difference between grown women dressing themselves for practical purposes at the gym, and grown men *designing* women for aesthetic pleasure. Also, suggesting that my previous comment boils down to "what you do doesn't matter because of what you wear" is to miss the point in such spectacular fashion that I question the value of further discussion. I don't know what you read the first time, but what I said was: There are many admirable traits about the character's execution, but there's nothing ambiguous about what drove her physical design   No it's not, our interpretation is based on [this](http://i.imgur.com/WNrdi0D.jpg). There are many admirable traits about the character's execution, but there's nothing ambiguous about what drove her physical design, and Gard is covering his ass because times changed.   I don't want to speak for peon47 here, but I'm pretty sure he skipped Uncharted because it's completely irrelevant, as Nathan Drake isn't objectified. The majority of AAA games present male protagonists as power fantasy surrogates, while female characters are far more often designed to titillate males rather than empower females.   The overwhelming majority of the comments here are idiotic, but this actually makes a really interesting point. Sexualized female game characters are so established that guys don't even think about them, while most straight gentlemen would probably be pretty uncomfortable playing a game with this protagonist. Plight of the female gamer.   You're projecting an awful lot there.   Thanks for sharing this! I always used a similar setup, but I never made the connection to tie the time remapping to a blank slider, that will make life a lot easier.   That doesn't seem relevant here.

 Spore. best one they've done   I get ads every single video and I watch it on my TV. Other channels aren't like this, but the Grumps are for some reason (probably because I watch a succession of videos on their channel)   The only time I think he's acknowledged the issues is when they weren't his fault (like when people gave him shit because of the six minute episode, when Arin/Dan didn't record enough footage)  Other than that, he isn't even able to fix those things except for the thumbnails   He misses an assload of cues and there were blank frames in a few episodes, the audio levels were fucked up for a while, he put up the wrong thumbnail once or twice, I'm sure there's more, these are just the ones I remember off the top of my head   (*looks closely*)  Insert Coin Here?   So a Rabbi, myself, and a minister walked into a bar and the bartender said "what is this, a joke?"    If the entertainer listening to the criticisms is ultimately their own personal choice, then what's the point of your comment here even existing?   There are a lot of stupid people that don't understand the concept of criticism. This is where people labeled ventgrumps as whiners, nitpickers, etc.   There's already several posts complaining that they don't want to be downvoted if they criticize the show. Why can't they stand that other people have a different opinion? "Oh no I got downvoted! I guess everyone else is an idiot!" is the general consensus amongst people like this.   The criticizers know that the Grumps have a choice.   The criticizers don't seem to know much of anything. There was a guy on Ventgrumps shortly before it closed complaining that Game Grumps is "now a comedy show and no longer talk about game design" **that** is exactly the problem with illegitimate criticism. If you don't understand what the show is and always has been to begin with, why should you post your opinion at all? And why is it such a sin for someone to downvote your completely useless opinion?   Thus, your comment is completely useless.  I can see that it went right over *your* head, but it's not useless if it helps ONE person understand my point   It's one of the best sketch comedy shows out there.  Check out their movie "Run Ronnie Run"   VentGrumps did the exact same thing if you tried to differ with someone's "Criticism" so don't act like this sub is so much worse when people downvote something they disagree with.   If they change the show to fit someone else's tastes, then there is a huge chance that it'll no longer appeal to the people who currently enjoy it (the same goes for all forms of entertainment)  The biggest problem I saw with VentGrumps was that people started their ~~whining~~ "criticisms" with the basic assumption that every person agreed that the show has decreased in quality at some point. (and the only ones who didn't were little children/fanboys that had shrines dedicated to the Glorious Grump Gods, or something) This is simply not true and the show always has its ups and downs, people just tend to remember the best parts and think it was more entertaining in the past.  Whenever there was a **legitimate** criticism *(like pointing out that I don't want to listen to 10 minutes of Arin trash-talking a game or watch 5 episodes of Arin dying in the same spot over and over again [both of which were only annoying because the conversations became stale])* I never got downvoted on the main sub and plenty of other people discussed this criticism openly on the main sub without downvoting.  If your post receives a large number of downvotes, that just means more people disagreed with your criticism than those who agree with you, regardless if it's "constructive" or not. Why diminish other peoples' enjoyment to please this **one** random person? If a musician I don't enjoy asked my opinion on how to make their music "better" and I offered some ideas that completely conflict with what their music is all about, do you think they should listen? More importantly, do you think they should listen to a large group of people all saying something different?  The only times I've seen Game Grumps pay attention to constructive criticism is when the majority of the fanbase agreed on something (my examples a few paragraphs above pertained to Super Mario 64 and their final few sessions of that playthrough showed that Dan was definitely listening to the people at that time and they got through with the game without any more problems) If that's the case, then you won't be downvoted. If it isn't the case and your criticism is downvoted, then you need to accept the different opinion and move on  In the end, an entertainer can only create something that **they** want to, because it is impossible to please everyone.   you're not alone.

It would be the greatest thing that could ever possibly happen on the channel, but sadly might not because Arin is "not interested" in that genre (whatever the fuck that means)     http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1nocie/dan_cowrote_this_new_rhett_link_rap_battle/cckjmuc   Knock knock!

If you'd never play them for your family and friends then that doesn't mean comedy has less value, it just means you don't think your family/friends would enjoy this particular band.   Nah. As awesome as Skyhill is, there's more value in comedy, which he is really talented at   thank you :)   It's a subject that interests me (I've never done any kind of drug though and probably never will)  I think what interests me the most is how many people have shared experiences. I've been meaning to look it up myself, but I think others might be able to explain it better than a long complicated article   Edit: I'm looking for a **scientific** explanation, not the typical spiritual drivel most people use when explaining it (hence why it's hard to research)   So did I!  By coincidence these are both my comedy idols.  What is the discussion you're referring to?   turns out God created the Earth on accident by spilling his soda   He **did** grow up as kind of a spoiled rich kid, so when the time came that he actually had to commit to/work hard on something, he probably couldn't handle it. It makes sense, and he did voice his disdain for the fact that it was a JOB (which is actually a very positive thing, despite his attitude toward it) several times on the show and in the Ode to Jon video    If you're JonTron 24/7, it's hard to stay funny and relevant, and that's probably part of why he left  True, but they only recorded on weekends in just a matter of hours. Hard to refer to that as 24/7   they're not owned by anyone (MCNs don't own anything, they just partner with people) but yeah, when it comes down to it, it's a **company** with **employees** that needs to keep the revenue flowing, at the very least in a just in case scenario where they end up losing money for some reason.   It's a compliment, but at the same time, people should've been educated long ago to understand that improvised scenes can be just as good as, if not better, than written scenes.

He's said it multiple times in interviews, this is the only one I know of for certain   that's what they're building right now, using money from Game Grumps and Starbomb.  Even if he did go to another studio, that wouldn't require him leaving the channel since his involvement in it is minimal already.  Danny had a day job up until the release of the first Starbomb album (because he only needs to be there for the recording sessions)   Wolfjob.    It'll be the whole channel once the company finally reaches the stage where they can create content for other platforms that provide more financial stability.  Arin and Ross are each working on an animated series, Starbomb is already a highly profited music project, Danny is always working on NSP and Starbomb, and there will be plenty of ideas that they'll have/pursue in the future.    I foresee a Ninja Sex Party movie at some point that will bomb at the box office despite being totally rad and hilarious (like Tenacious D's movie)   So for what purpose would he leave a job that gives him an area to animate in an office that only asks him to work for an hour or two a week, leaving the rest of the time to animate?  	93

 I've noticed that c9 fans for the most part stayed loyal when they were slumping.    The reason why it's working IMO is that Bjergsen is on the same level as the rest of the mids in this tourney, unlike in NA where he is clearly above everyone else. This means the teams don't have to worry as much about him snowballing out of control, so they can focus Dyrus more and still be fine. If Incarnation lives up to the hype this could be a viable strat for c9 as well.   I wouldn't say it's trash. It's got very high damage (640 base + 2.4 bonus AD is actually insane), heals her a good amount, and synergizes stupidly well with a sheen. It's definitely not a top ult but it's not bad.   Easyhoon is pretty damn good   The reason why the "tank meta" came into play is a new item, Cinderhulk. It essentially gives you 25% bonus Hp. This means people are stacking HP. This makes Irelia sad as 75 true damage is much less to a tank with 4-5k hp then a bruiser that has 2-3k.   He's likely scrimming. Nobody else on c9 has played games at this time as well.   To be fair that was with a Youmou's active and a Righteous Glory. You're normally not going to be that fast.   Lucian and graves at least long ranged abilities (Q,W,R), this lets them get harder CS and poke the laner. Vayne has literally nothing.   She was a FOTM pick, but the meta has shifted to tanks, and she struggles against them compared to the ranged top laner meta that was before. She's still a popular and strong solo queue pick, just not *as* highly contested as she was.   This is quite late of a reply, but zed into Cho is a terrible matchup for the zed. All the zed can do is farm from a distance with his Q. He gets bullied early on, and can't ever have kill pressure if the cho plays right. Zed loses in a poke war, he can't farm in melee range, and is literally unable to win an all-in at any point of the game. All Cho has to do is rupture behind him if zed tries to ult, and then burst him while he's silenced. Incarnation likely just won that matchup due to experience + being more skilled.   True, it's often important, but not always. For example Kassadin has the lowest win rate in the game but he's still a fine pick if you know how to play him.   Twitch chat already has quite a few Sneaky x Meteos x Incarnation fanfics typed up. They're interesting to say the least.   Kassadin is a fine pick, he's just a shadow of his former self. They neutered his damage, stripped his utility, and reduced his trademark mobility. He's literally been nerfed in every single aspect of his gameplay. He's got a low win rate as he had a high learning curve, and has a low early-mid game impact. While he's not mechanically hard, he is hard to play. He's all about timing and decision making.  People say he should be reworked/deleted as he has been proven impossible to balance, especially for competitive. He has been nerfed over and over again since his 99%ban rate days, but every single time he has risen to be a high priority pick in competitive play. You can even see him slowly beginning his return back into the meta again recently. Such high mobility (even after the recent changes) will always be a huge deal.   Nocturne would become a much stronger pick. One of his biggest weaknesses is that you can flash out of his fear.   She has the problem of it having a energy cost though. She can't spam it    Yeah he has a good early clear, but his duelling is non-existent early game. It's just a risk fighting him cause he can CC-lock you long enough for the laners to collapse.   The one thing I see 'bad' kassadins do is not properly auto-reset with your W. Early game that is actually the majority of your burst, and late game that's over 200 damage of your combo wasted. Also, your ult does a deceptively high amount of damage, especially after a couple stacks. Near 500 damage at level 16 IIRC.   Isn't CDR a pretty useless stat on him? It benefits his ult CD and that's about it   When the announcer says "An enemy is godlike" in that quiet, whispered tone. It's like she's saying "gg easy"   LMQ beat OMG at worlds last year. I wouldn't consider that 'worse then LSPL'   As someone who plays a ton of noc, his problem is itemization. If he builds damage he'll explode, if he builds tanky he won't be a threat. He needs to build bruisery, which doesn't really work for a mid laner   Yeah he's my second most played champ. His play style has changed a bit, making him more difficult for solo queue, but he's still effective. He's mechanically easy, just requires game sense and experience with him more then anything. If you're just learning him you'll likely misjudge his damage for awhile. (Like your auto-W and ult both do a deceptively high amount of damage, and your QE does a lot less)   He has some of the lowest base damages in the game, minimal utility (only a 1s slow), a fairly poor pre-6 (generally just stagnates the lane), and a long ramp up time due to taking ROA + usually Athenes. He's amazing if you know how to play him, and he's fairly safe, but it's hard to make an impact on the game early on if you're inexperienced with him.   Nocturne is still a strong carry jungler. Warrior vs Devourer is personal preference (Warrior gives better early ganks and higher burst, Devourer scales better and makes you a stronger duelist), and then BOTRK is a great item on him. From there you should usually go randuins+banshee, and then choose between being more tanky or an additional offensive item.   In lower elo with both champions taking ignite is worth it. They both snowball incredibly hard that getting an early kill in lane to start it off will cause you to dominate the game   Plus morello is slowly leaving the meta in favor of athenes, which is major for mundo   Slot efficiencygold effeciency. Plus you're also ignoring the fact that passives aren't calculated in gold efficiency, when they're often the most important part of an item. On paper essence reaver might look better then IE, but in game the infinity edge is so much better    Pantheon actually has insanely good ratios. His problem is the fact they're hard to use. His E does 3.6AD to champions for example. That's around standard ratios for a assassins full burst. The problem is that he has to stand still for a second to use that, which leads to his death if building damage.   Nothing is scarier then a Nasus 20 minutes in and 400 stacks, with a sheen, frozen heart and cowl TP'ing into a fight. He can literally 1v3 at that point.   Idk, the c9 hype was pretty big before the season even started. Just watch their first game against DIG, the casters hype up the team of 'solo queue prodigys' that are destroying challenger teams.   You like making adcs cry   Irelia   Nocturne  Kassadin   And kalista   As somebody who was in your exact situation last season (stuck in B4/b3 for the longest time). I know where you're coming from. I would definitely recommend avoiding bot lane unless you find someone good to duo with. 9/10 games you will have a full AP Lux 'support', or an adc who has 20cs at 10, or something of the like. Mid/top/jungle are usually the easier roles to have an impact with at bronze.  Looking through your op.gg, you should cut back on the amount of champions you play. Find one for each role that you love and suits your play, and stick with him. Don't worry about counterpicks at your level, they truly don't matter. Comfortcounterpicks until youre pretty much in diamond. I literally only played Irelia, nocturne, and Kassadin (for top/jungle/mid respectively) for my entire climb out of bronze. I think i had over 80% win rate the entire time from b4 to s4 (where the season ended)  Buy wards. I'm not saying spend all your money on them, but literally put a deep pink in the enemy jungle (which will last all game), and upgrade your warding trinket, and you'll be better then 99% of bronze.  This is a weird piece of advice, but it's very effective. Learn to change your mindset. Realize the players your against will make mistakes, and punish them for it. 90% of the time the enemy will stay in the lane when they're too low, or fight in the minion waves, or something like that. Learn what those mistakes are, and abuse them. You should easily be getting fed in lane every game once it 'clicks' for you.   If you have any questions, just PM me. I'm not an amazing player, but I've been in the same situation as you before so I know what to get out of it.   A combination of assassins leaving the meta and the release of Ludens. Kog is extremely vulnerable early game, against many assassins he's pretty much free gold. The release of Ludens gave him a much earlier powerspike then before, now he's a threat after 1 item, when before you needed a good 3 or more to really be scary.    Either build on-hit items or crit. The main draw of AD Shyvana is that she essentially has the ability to do 3 autos (two of them AOE) in the space of one. Assuming you're not going full 4x IE + ghost blade one-shot cheese, the best build would be something like a Yi   So it doesn't actually effect AD scaling ability damage. Hurricane is primarily meant to be an auto attacking based item.   I guarantee they will nerf her as/level in this new update.   Probably just hoping someone else would dodge first   You can give tryouts but still heavily favor an option beforehand. It'll be incarnation unless he totally shits the bed, or someone plays absolutely amazing.   Nocturne top. You outtrade him early on with your passive (you don't draw minion aggro with it if you use it on a minion and hit Darius too), you all-in him level 2 or 3 and win every time. If you end up behind you can either shove him in easy and roam or just CS with your Q. Once you get Botrk you can 1v1 him easily for the rest of the game, you can do it even earlier if your confident with your spell shielding of his ult.   Nothing happened to her. It's just that she has always had the ability to essentially have three auto attacks in the space of one. Build crit and it gets pretty scary    The dude definitely did it on purpose too   You know he did it on purpose too   Let's use Ahri as an example. If you rushed deathcap you would have around ~200ap once you factor in runes masteries and dorans items. with a 2.6 ap ratio in her whole kit you would do a total of 520 bonus damage. If you rushed Ludens you would sit at around 150ap. Since her full combo let's you get two Ludens procs, you have a total ap ratio of 2.9ap + 200 bonus damage. All together this is a total of 635 bonus damage. This is a larger early powerspike, as well as being cheaper + giving better wave clear.    The top team in challenger (Origin for Eu, Enemy for NA) gets automatically promoted. The second and third place teams play against the two teams that are in relegations from the LCS.   I doubt it. Only this split has TSM ever really been better then c9, so there would be zero reason for sneaky to leave to what was a worse team. Plus, he still has the loyalty + friendship factor of him being with the same roster the last few years.   He'll 'raise the level' by adding another strong adc to the LCS. He's definitely not going to be better then Sneaky or anything, but from what I've seen he seems like he'll be a decent middle of the pack adc like Apollo.   I'm not even kidding, this literally happened to me last game. Sivir was attacking the nexus turrets and I dashed near her on Ahri. She autos me once, I instantly die. Death recap said ricochet did like 1800 damage. I was likely directly on top of minions as it happened mid-dash.   I originally chalked it up to having super minions focusing me or something, but it doesn't really make any sense as they only had two of them, and I died *instantly*.   And somehow adding a belt and a chain mail to make a Flaming Cape doesn't bother you?   Or two books to make a gun?    Irelia top. I play her at a much higher level then the rest of my champions. If I didn't get bored of her and play other ones I'd probably be a much higher tier then I am now   Vladimir is actually quite an easy matchup. From the moment you hit level 3/4 you just go balls deep on him every time he comes near a minion wave. The key to the lane is using your stickyness to make him miserable early on. Playing passive is how you lose lane against him.   Olaf is a bit tricky. Excluding level 1 he will pretty much always outtrade you, there are certain windows of power where you can actually kill him though. Unfortunately I haven't played this matchup in forever so I can't tell you exactly when.  I find the worst matchup is either Darius or Volibear. Both absolutely wreck you early on. Voli is especially annoying as he stacks HP, which means you'll never do much to him with your true damage.   A standard build is something like Morellos frozen heart zhonya's abyssal deathcap, shoes are really situational but often Sorcs or mercs   She's a direct counterpick to Velkoz, of course you're going to have a rough time. It's like a pre-nerf talon being picked against Kassadin, the lane is supposed to be living hell.   The sad part was he finished his career with 99 wins   DAARRKNESSSS! The screen goes black as a teemo flies at you   I understand its just me. Thats why im asking advice. All I know is that ive gone from a good win rate on him to losing every game on him with what appears to be decent scores.    As somebody who used to play kassadin with tons of success before the range nerfs, I've recently picked him up again. However, I have found that no matter how good I do early , I can't seem to close a game out. My last few games I have had scores of 11/5/5/, 9/4/5, 7/3/2, 10/6/4, etc. I've tried all sorts of different builds to see if its the problem, but to no success. Has his playstyle fundamentally changed (from the clean-up assassin) or something? My two most played champions are Irelia and Nocurne (70% win rate on both), so kassadin generally follows a similar playstyle (in the fact he dives the backline)   /r/talonmains   Could you imagine Hai shot calling as a coach with Incarnation as the actual mid laner?    Just a fail-safe in case Incarnati0n comes to NA and he ends up being a massive flop, or doesn't mesh with the team. This gives him a 'trial period' to see how he works,    Exactly. I could honestly see an adc import from NA to EU at some point, due to all of the top teams having a spot filled. Let's use an example like if doublelift decides to leave CLG, there aren't any top teams in NA that would need him, but there are a couple I could think of in EU that might.   It's pretty much just in case Incarnati0n goes to NA and just absolutely shits the bed.   We're always completely dank here :^)   *Danish talent is superior   This has actual people he knows commenting on it (such as Alex Penn), so it seems legit.   Damn, I never knew Monte had that much respect for Hai   Those donations were all trolls. You can put your name down as anything you want when you donate.   Hai does tilt to be fair   Its a necessary change, but it doesn't make it any less sad. I sure hope he decides to stick around in the organization though.   He wouldn't cry about it. Plus, sneaky has said on stream that 'he cant talk about it'. Its pretty much confirmed.   He used to be a top mid laner. He finished S4 spring as playoff MVP with like a 54 kda   Why would POE leave though? UOL is having enough success on their own to really justify a move, especially across the ocean   They're saying when you're at your proper ELO. If you're way above your actual level (IE smurfing), it should be more like 80/20 or 90/10.   Rylai's lets you chain your ults on Kog though. The slow makes it near impossible for them to run out of your ult range when you land your first one. Plus it makes it WAY easier to continually keep hitting the targets when they are slowed. The Rylai's + Liandries combo also works very well with him as he has low ratios, and insane poke.   Not only picked, but being first pick or ban tier, all without even a rework.   Incarnati0n is a medium risk/high reward option IMO. They can either keep their full roster, and slowly decline until they go from second, to third, fourth, over a few seasons until they're struggling to make playoffs. Or they can take a risk, and potentially become the best team in the west again. Of course it could blow up in their face, but really, how many splits would you honestly say they have left before they're just outclassed, and Hai's shot calling can't cover the holes they have?  Either way, I'll support c9 with or without Hai 100%, I'm perfectly fine with whatever decision they make.    There was sexual abuse of children in the books, but the show is pretty clean   No because TSM lost against c9 in the last week of the regular season   Plus a terrible early game. You're literally a sitting duck pre-6 without any lane pressure.   It's because that lets say every member on the one team has a different ward skin. Someone could go clear the ward, and see it's the junglers. They could then realize the jungler was near and plan accordingly.   I always thought it was a toss-up between Bjergsen or Sneaky. I'm fine with either.   I'm pretty sure Kassadin wasn't a very well designed champion. They've had to nerf his damage and utility to the ground, and change up his trademark mobility, and he is still a viable pick.   Since when did they buff thresh hooks to be a targeted ability?   *whoosh*   Because porpoise actually isn't that bad, and is still actually a pro unlike oddone.   Turtle adc, porpoise jungle, Shiphtur mid, Zionspartan top, Sheep support. Actually not *that* bad   There's a esports lawyer on this subreddit, I forget his username though. He'd be able to help you with a lot    The thing is between Hai and Bjerg, is that in a straight 1v1 lane, Bjerg will likely win 9/10 times. However, winning lane doesn't win the game. If Bjergsen doesn't actually snowball, hai brings enough to the team that he can still have a larger impact.   Where would you find the Hecarim ban? Getting balls off rumble is much more important, you don't want to let Meteos have nidalee or Sejuani, and leaving Hai Zed is never the greatest idea.    Give c9 some credit. Balls looks to be out of his slump, and will outclass dyrus if he is. Meteos can match santorin, Sneaky is better then turtle. The only real thing is that Hai just has to survive against bjergsen. It should be a fairly even series IMO, with a slight advantage to TSM.   Corki too   Dying is almost expected on backline diving bruisers like Irelia or Hecarim. You want to dive in and draw all the attention to you while letting your carries shred the enemy team.    Well you could argue that now that balls is back in form, that tsm's weak point (Dyrus) is against c9's strong point.    They are both high skill-cap champs that can be useless in the wrong hands. Sounds about right.   Robert was pretty good too    Same with Nintendude   I missed Pr0lly and Bubba. All we need is Robert to coach a LCS team and we've got the complexity coaching dream   NALCS: where random shit happens for a couple months and then it's a TSM C9 final.   I'd honestly put sneaky over him for best ADC in the west. Sneaky is just so much more clutch   Why so?  	101

 Which implies that the TDK was not a departure in tone from Begins. In what way is the Tone of Rises more removed from the tone of TDK than TDK is from Begins?  unless you are saying that each film has been a departure, but for some reason dislike Rises for it.   What about the film makes you say this?  Why do you think that TDK and Begins have a more consistent tone than TDK and Rises?   I think he's probably asking for some of your judgements. Not why you didn't judge it the first time.   It's disingenuous to suggest I was definitely suggesting it was you who was being disingenuous.   About that particular sentence, at least.  *squints eyes*   I wouldnt call Scarlet Witch a lead either.  It's hard to say about upcomming movies.

I wouldn't call most of those leads.    The Long Good Friday   Like a...a short....film!    There are plenty of characterizations of the Joker that work just fine in their respective films/books.

 I agree they're the team to beat, I just think they'll get beat. And just adding Pat Bev doesn't make them non contenders, but having to face real PG's every round will wear them down. Pat and TP and CP3 were just examples of how tough of a road they just so happen to have avoided this year. Next year they could get hit with Bev, then CP3, then Westbrook in consecutive series. Just saying, it'll be a huge adjustment. And trying to repeat in a stacked conference is no easy task   KD is nowhere near 6'8. Lebron is 6'8. KD has at least 4 inches on him. and Yao does have 60 pounds on him, but he played below the rim. KD plays up and flies around. way more room for error when you jump 20+ inches in the air every time you take a jumper   Yeah! Always played hard when I saw him   Thank long PG for the Lakers whose name escapes me. Saw him a couple times and the dude can play   quick question. who would you rather get in free agency, Norris Cole or Mo Gotti?   OKC has Dion Waiters, so they automatically are going to have something catastrophic happen to them.    that's just a dick thing to say.    Warriors won't make it back. Didn't have to face a single legit point guard in their entire playoff run. A healthy Pat Beverly in their way, or Chris Paul, or Tony Parker who Curry has to guard would completely change their dynamic. I think the West is gonna be wide open again.  Pierce is out of Washington, so they don't have a chance. Chicago just isn't good outside of Jimmy buckets and he can't win a series by himself. Atlanta is gonna be in the mix in the Easy but I just don't see them as a strong team when it comes down to it. I think the Bucks are coming, the Celtics are coming, a healthy Bosh puts the Heat in the playoffs but they aren't much. Cavs are a lock, in my book.    Because big men with foot issues have foot issues forever. KD is a legit 7 footer. So he fits in the Yao Ming vein. Similar to Joel Embiid's foot issue that could take him out of next year as well. Big men just don't get over problems quickly   Also Kyrie Irving and Mike Miller have underwear deals. Just so you know   this is so blown out of proportion by Stein. Every player disagrees with their coach from time to time and Lebron had the weight of the world on him and he knew what it takes to win a Finals series. I think Blatt knew that too and handled Lebrons intensity with class. No harm, no foul   Yeah, but he's played more minutes than anyone in history in a 5 years span, not including team USA. he has to rest better throughout the season, and I don't just mean cutting his minutes down to 39 which is still highest in the league. I mean cutting down to at most 35 and having games that he takes off periodically like the Warriors did.    Cavs gotta take a page out of the Warriors book and take their resting strategy. Kept their guys healthy and fresh when it mattered   Dudes get hurt on his teams every damn year. Bosh in '12, DWade essentially the last 3 years with his knee, Kyrie and KLove.... he always has help up until the big moments. so sad   King of the "no pressure end of game" 3s that don't mean anything   Lets talk about what needs to happen in the off season to get our minds off of this. I'm sad    Lebron in the post, score. fuckin shit man. do that the whole game and were in this   Man, Lebron didn't back up his bold statement at all. So disappointing.    BACK COURT GOOD GOD   LETS GO OH MY GOD WE CAN DO THIS   MY GOD DELLY WHY ARE YOU PLAYING   Can someone seriously help me understand why Lebron is 30 feet away from the basket every possession instead of posting up? It's worked all series!! why stop going to it?! 6 3 point attempts is too damn much with half the Warriors in foul trouble.    Shump can't dribble and can't make a layup. why is he in the game   DOES LEBRON NOT WANT THE BALL?   is Lebron refusing the post this game or what?   I mean, that's essentially what I gathered from every half time speech I've ever heard.    If we made free throws and calmed THE FUCK down and cut the turnovers down, we'd be up 8 to 10.    incorrect. Warriors shooting jumpers, Cavs driving the ball   clock didn't reset after Lebrons shot hit the rim. legal bucket, shot clock guy just didn't react quick enough   Lebron on the post. Lebron on the post. that's all you gotta do.    If you see that and say there's no contact, you too are blinded by his strength. There's contact on EVERY drive. some of them aren't fouls, but some of them are.    I agree, but some of them are.    How the fuck are these refs not calling anything on these Lebron drives? He gets punished for being too strong.    seriously. if they win it in general I'm gettin Lebrons logo tattooed on my body somewhere.    that's one game boss. that's hardly research    nothing you said is correct. it's not worth forming an argument against someone when they don't even bother to bring real stats to the table   that's not even true. you should get over your laziness and actually find something to backup your claims. you won't find it, but you should try. and "others" are dumb if they want dellavedova and Shumpert taking shots from beyond the 3 point line instead of a Lebron jump hook from 8 feet.    everyone who shares this idea knows nothing about basketball.    haha okay boss   so? still can't stop him even though he can't shoot   hahahah I still think it's funny that he's the "Lebron stopper" when Lebron is averaging 36, 13 and 9.    hahahhaha bent penis.    This shouldn't even be a conversation. Westbrook was doing it in the regular season, Lebrons doing it on the biggest stage in the profession. No comparison whatsoever.    every time a player drives they initiate contact. that's not the formula they use to decide of it was a foul or not. Draymond tried to go in and hammer it down on Moz and Lebron and both were called fouls even though he initiated the contact and both guys went straight up. it's lopsided and there's no way around it   That's my interpretation of it actually. I always thought we were seeing exactly what he said he wanted to see, so we don't know if it's actually there or not. but I just think it would have made for a better ending if you closed without seeing Bruce.    no, you literally don't know how to read obviously. he isn't getting on JVG. he is saying that because he shits on us so much, when he says WE aren't getting calls, you KNOW we must not be getting calls. it has nothing to do with JVG hate. learn how to read and interpret a sentence bud   no. watch it back, half of his drives he got hit on and it should have been a foul. clearly   you're retarded and clearly don't know how to read.    because he shoots 3s and does drive to the rim 30+ times a game idiot. and it should be called a foul because it's a foul.    WHERE. THE FUCK. ARE. THE CALLS. MY FUCKING. LORD.    OH MY GOD WHAT IS THE LEAGUES AGENDA WITH THESE GOD AWFUL SHITTY REFS?!?! ITS ATROCIOUS   Moz earned it, but he can't guard any wings.    correct   :'(   GOD DAMMIT SHUMP   I think Moz's minutes are going to mirror Bogut/Ezeli. he just can't guard wings and if he gets doubled in the post like they've been doing, he won't be able to make that pass that Lebron can make   Shumpert is fucking retarded   LEBRON NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT THAT WHEN HE DOMINATES THE BALL AND SCORES A LOT, WE WIN.    haha nah. just the ones that popped in my head   Just meant that I like our chances when guys are throwing up 3s instead of open dunks. Didn't mean they weren't scary   Hayden Christensen's acting in Star Wars II and III.   Why did Nolan choose to show Bruce Wayne and Selena Kyle at the end of The Dark Knight Rises? would have made for a much better "Nolan-like" ending if he hadn't and left it up to the audience to decide what happened.      and that's why you have no championships, sir. Ego   I mean, allay had 34 the other night but he wasn't hot by any stretch in the second half. We bottled him up pretty well after his first half burst. In honestly not as worried about those guys because they're shooters. and it's a make or miss league. you live with those. it's the draymond cuts and back doors for dunks or iggy fastbreaks or Shaun Livingston post ups on smaller guards that can kill us, in my opinion.    I never said he didn't fit that bill. I never disputed Marion's ability to contribute in the same fashion Mike could either. I don't know where you got that from. All I'm doing is disputing the fact that Mike can't contribute as well as Marion. They can both help the team, but you said Mike was essentially a waste and Marion needs a shot, all in saying is Mike and Marion both deserve time because they can both contribute.    the lineup isn't changing. just can't put timo on iggy, gotta have him on Green. put TT on Barnes and Lebron on Iggy or vice versa. try to weather the storm until those mid quarter subs come in when we can go smaller   No, you at Mike Miler because he is a winner who does whatever is necessary to win. Hustle plays are necessary. Making shots is necessary too, but when you don't play a minute for months and then get thrown in a Finals game, you can expect some rust. If he gets minutes, he'll hit shots. Marion can't make shots   I've been a Lebron James die-hard follower since '06 because that was the first year I watched basketball. Over the past decade of watching him play, and especially the past 5 years or so, I've learned many things about the way he plays and approaches a playoff series. Game 4s, historically, are his rest game. He doesn't take them off per-say, but he doesn't come out guns blazing like other games. This isn't an accident however, because he has a plan. I think it is a psychological trick he uses to get the other team over confident. because wen game 5 rolls around, he turns it on. he looks different, has a new look in his eyes, new energy. he finds a way to get it done. people counted this team out, then when he started to dominate jumped on the bandwagon, then when they lost and tied the series, dove head first off the bandwagon back onto the Warriors side. What I know is this: Lebron the Underdog is one of the scariest Lebrons you'll ever see. and now that he is back to that spot, look out. I AM CONFIDENT BECAUSE WHEN YOU COME AT THE KING YOU BEST NOT MISS. IT'S MEANT TO BE. I CAN FEEL IT    I think the only name you change is the Clippers because what the fuck? I think you gotta rebrand a lot of teams tho. Like the Raptors? Make it more menacing like a Jurassic park raptor. The Nets need a rebrand, the Magic need a rebrand, the Jazz need one... lot of these teams just have outdated looks to them   even with that being true, if the Cavs play their best game, they can beat the Warriors at full strength   did you just ignore the original comment? we aren't discussing his shooting   you see the way he landed on that leg? could have EASILY seriously damaged his knee if he tried to land normally. have to take the momentum somewhere   but the same goes for the Cavs...    and miller dove for a loose ball...   Yeah, if he was going to have an off game or maybe even take a game off to an extent, game 4 is the one. It only tied the series. Brand new series now and two days rest before 5 and 7 are all we need for Lebron to cement his legacy. I BELIEVE   this is the silver lining for me. if everyone is going to have a shitty game, I'm glad it all happened at once. it can only go up from here.    lol no. I said Lebron should shoot every time he is single covered. you said he should share the ball. look how that turned out dumb ass   Lebron doesn't wanna play. He's dead. Ready for this to be over. Hope he snaps outta this bull shit   I knew JR wasn't gonna be worth shit when he rode in the gym on a fuckin scooter   Jesus Christ JR is shit. get off the floor damn   We need him to not take stupid fading contested shots.    DEFENSE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS!!!!!! LETS GO!!!!   OH MY GOD FUCK JOEY CRAWFORD IN THE MOST DISRESPECTFUL WAY POSSIBLE. HE'S AN ARROGANT CHODE WITH A GOD COMPLEX THE SIZE OF KANYE WEST AND AN AGENDA TO ELIMINATE THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS AND TO GET LEBRON INJURED. FUCK THIS GUY    Moz and Tristan finna eat   Warriors panicking with the lineup change   oh, I understand.    I don't. he can't shoot midrange like speights, he fouls once every 2 minutes, and the Cavs saw the same film the Warriors did with DLee in. He'll be a virtual non factor    but by saying they took their own guys out of the offense by giving Lebron a historic number of touches, you imply that he shouldn't shoot the ball every time he is single covered by guys who can't guard him. if you give other guys shots, you aren't taking advantage of the best mismatch in basketball.    first of all, didn't say bounce pass. second of all, you're wrong. go watch the film   so you're saying you don't want Lebron shooting when he's single covered? what? the current strategy is to destroy the Warriors strategy. other people don't shoot or get the ball bc the Warriors are too stupid to double him. and when you double him, other guys have open looks and lanes, resulting in better play. come on now, don't be dumb   They'll still trap the PnR with Curry, but instead of leaving Lee open on the roll or pop, they'll rotate everybody over a man. So, big man on the opposite side comes over to cover Lee, guy in the corner slides to cover the big man who covered Lee, and you leave the ball side corner man open. if the pass goes there, it's ball side so one of the two trapping Curry can simply close out quickly and recover and you're back in your defensive set. it's not a hard offensive set to counter against, they just didn't have time to do it in Game 3.    Yes, but GState hasn't had a lead at the end of any quarter in the entire series with the OT in game 1 being the only exception. They might be able to make it close if the spread gets big, but they haven't proven that they have the mental fortitude to get over the hump. Lebron knows how to close, they don't yet.    the cave haven't played their best ball at all! with the exception of Delly, no one on the team has. Lebron has been missing open layups all series, JR can't buy a bucket, Moz can't catch half the time, TT can't make a layup or putback, JJ isn't as hot from 3 as usual... if the Cavs play a sound offensive game for once in the series, they steamroll GState be of how they have proven they can handle them defensively   I think the game Lebron has a good shooting night, we'll see something truly historic. Like, he misses 4 or 5 open layups in the first half of game 3. If he just makes those, he's in the 50s while still taking the same number of shots. Can't wait for him to get a hot streak   But just like they saw how that worked for them, we did as well. So we had just as much time to gameplan against that lineup and action as they did to implement it. I'm really not worried that much about DLee being in the game. He is a fouling machine anyway   strikes me as media savvy. keeps all eyes on him and dumb media fluff instead of basketball and his team. allows the team to stay focused   don't. don't say that.    A bro you can enjoy some afternoon Friends with, is a bro indeed.    not with back spasms he cant   nope. Delly wasn't on him in the 4th* when he got hot. Delly was dehydrated and that made the Cavs have to switch screens and put Shump on him instead of Delly. that won't happen next game   It didn't result in a lead in any quarter in the entire series except for the OT of game one. and that one wasn't bc of good shooting, team made 1 fg in that period. all free throws   Then why did he win MVP? Because he can dribble well sometimes? I'm still confused about how a guy with worse stats overall than the other 5 guys in consideration won the award that says you're the most important and valuable player in this league, simply because he has god handles. which any And 1 player has. So stupid   "vast majority"  	102

 Or pebcak.   Want a port for the Nexus 5 PLX! :(   Fuck the whole amoled vs non amoled debate. I want them to stop trying to shove 4k resolution screens into phones. Higher resolutions mean more power hungry screens.    This is the proper way to do it, and exactly the way the eustathios does it.   GT2 belts don't use Kevlar cords, unfortunately.  They use fiberglass, or some other weaker material.  I think there might be some special manufacturers out there who make them with Kevlar (like the T-series belts) but I haven't been able to find one. :(   The eustathios can use an open ended belt for the X/Y Gantry.  In fact, belt tensioners are build into the printed carriages.  You don't need a closed loop belt for the X/Y gantry because the X and Y never move far enough to actually cause your joint to go past the pulleys.  However, the eustathios does need closed loop belts for the extention of the drive motor to under the bed, and for the Z drive.  That's because the smooth rod on the outsides has to turn quite a lot in order to move the carriages.  Same for the screw drive bed.     In that very example, down in the comments:   Hey there, Im an engineer with Fenner Drives (we make NinjaFlex). I just wanted to add a few comments given that his review has been linked to by so many sources. First off, thanks for the thorough consideration of the product and the detail that you provide on printer settings. The comment my printer is a RepRapPro Huxly which has a bowden extruder which might actually not be ideal for extruding a soft and springy filament. is key. I dont have experience with bowden extruders, but given the concept, *I was actually very surprised that you were able to get moderate quality prints with this setup.* From all the testing weve done on flexible materials, the 2 key factors for getting high quality prints seem to befully supporting the filament b/w the drive gear exit and entrance to the cold end.and reducing the drag due to the tacky surface of flexible filaments. And maybe a close 3rd would behigh retraction settings to improve stop/start. None of these match up well with a Bowden. SoIf you have access to a non-Bowden printer and are interested in making this a more comprehensive review, please give it a try. If you search on thingiverse for FD_Engineer, you can see some parts I posted that show typical print quality. Let me know if you want more info. Thanks, Steve  Also, I'm not claiming your belts aren't straight.  I was merely giving an example of one of the many problems that can go wrong with a delta geometry printer.  Don't take this as any kind of personal attack.    I don't know what picture you are looking at.  The one that the OP posted.  You can clearly see that the belts are not anchored completely linearly.  It's obvious, because the frame, which is straight is right next to it and easy to see.  Mind showing me these people printing FilaFlex with a bowden setup?   Really garbage, tbqh.  They don't offer any kind of unlimited data plan at all.  I got hit with my cap rather quickly.  I'd try out T-Mobile - If you're willing to bring your own device, you can save a bunch of money.  100 minutes, unlimited text, unlimited data, LTE speeds (74mbps download over on sand lake!).  http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-plans - It's hidden, one of the smaller text ones, with no link to the plan (you get it by buying a SIM)  Not to mention, being prepaid, if you don't like it, you're not locked into a contract and can try someone else.   And I'm not saying Delta owners haven't.  But each machine I build goes through 2 full days of burn-in testing.  We print a 2 layer big-gear, to ensure that everything stays flat edge to edge, and we print a "6 tower test" on each edge to ensure that each tower is completely straight and layers align properly.   Equivalent areas of pain are experienced across gender boundaries.   Well, just as a small example - from the picture, I can tell that those belts are not straight.  Ok, fine - not straight belts aren't so much of an issue, right?  Not so.  Non linear belt will end up changing tension as the carriage rolls up and down the linear rail.  We print 6 towers, on the very edge of our build plate to check for stuff like this.  As that tension changes, the geometry of your part changes.  So our "6 tower test", would be likely to fail with edges of the towers seemingly wobbling random as they were built higher in layer.  It's not a large effect, mind you - but it's there.  I honestly couldn't tell you if the people here with delta 3D printers of their own actually ever print any test objects.  It's likely they don't.  If things seem like they're working in the middle, they never see the minute errors that are part of the print.  That's just one example.  I know of about 5-6 other failure modes that are _completely_ non-intuitive when they do arrive as well.  The Kossel looks like it uses "real" linear railing, so it's less likely to hit at least 1 of those failure modes I speak of, but still.  Also, I know from experience that 3D printed corner brackets are far less sturdy than people might expect.  A lot of our prototype machines were made with 3D printed corners and have a bit of wobble to them.  Additionally, the i3 can print in things like FilaFlex, NinjaFlex, etc with the proper (printed) extruder.  The delta is limited to bowden only, so you're limited to hard plastics like PLA.  (There is some work in remedying this, myself among the researchers)  I do agree with further assessments in this thread, that an I3v would be better - additionally, I think a Mendel90 would be best.   I work for DeltaMaker, so I've got a lot of experience building Delta printers.  I've built over 240 of them by hand so far, and let me tell you....  Get the Prusa i3 instead.  Diagnosing issues on delta printers when they do arise, is a huge pain in the dick.     Whatever you do, do _NOT_ use a Raspberry Pi.  The ethernet is run off of a puny USB 2.0 bus, which is shared among other devices as well, you will severely limit your speeds if you do such a thing.   I use [Pronterface](https://github.com/kliment/Printrun) for controlling my 3D printer.  Python GUI.   This is key.  If you don't use enough PlastiDip, the stuff only comes off in little chunks.  You've gotta have a bunch of coats in order to make it thick enough to peel off whenever you want to peel it off.   I'll never understand people like this.  It's a fucking car.  It's an extension of your personality, you chose it, and customizing it is one of the first things _any_ car owner should do.   Nobody worth a shit, gives a shit about that woman.   If you've got a Mercedes, and you don't at least open 'er up once in a while, you're fucking driving it wrong.   Well, it does make them solid!   The master key, is a key which has its own key pattern - which can unlock multiple doors with differing key patterns.   Linux shouldn't be that far away in implementing it. We already have a kernel flag for avoiding bad ram, we just don't apply it on the fly.  (Or maybe this was a custom set of patches that I once used? Has this been mainlined?)    Oh, I certainly understand cherishing not having to do it any more.  Major difference between brain-work, and physical labor.  But those that do the physical labor aren't any less of people.   Make sure belt tension is correct (not just tighten them, make sure they're not over-tight as well).  Make sure all set screws and pulleys are securely fastened down.  Pulley slipping on a quick travel move is pretty common.  Make sure you're not moving too low on the Z, allowing your X ends to lift off of the nuts.   It's amazing how many people in this sub are absolutely _JOYOUS_ about their ignorance.  You know how many Architects I know that hang drywall?  About a half dozen.  And they know how to frame, block, and wire a building as well.  Yet that seems to be the go-to explanation here...  Know how many computer engineers I know that say "Oh, I just design integrated circuits and ASICS, I don't ever actually use them"...pretty much none.  The fuck is wrong with you people...  I get it, being an electrical engineer isn't the same as being an electrician.  But you damn sure have about 90% of the knowledge domain and then some that you could easily do that job.   And?  Companies have always used proxy shell corporations in order to attack the things they didn't like or that competed with them.  It's not a new tactic, it's not an evil tactic either.  It's a way to protect a much larger company from huge losses.  I said let's be pragmatic here...   While I wholeheartedly agree, most plebs probably don't.  In order to bring them over to the master race, we must take these things into account!   I don't think you can say "aesthetics!" and then show a picture of a terminal. It defeats the purpose.  While I love me some terminal time, a regular user is going to see this screenshot and dive right into the fact that there are terminal windows on it.    It's called a polyfuse or resettable fuse.  Or a thermistor.  Basically as more and more power goes through it, it heats up.  At some point it basically trips for electrical safety.  Problem is that these are often faulty, low quality, or once they've tripped they have a tendency to trip in the future much easier.  It's OK to use a relay.  A friend of mine ended up desoldering his, buying these external 20A car fuse terminals, and soldering those into place.  (Like this: http://p.globalsources.com/IMAGES/PDT/B1062636862/Car-fuse-holder.jpg)   All I fucking want, is a Linux phone with the ability to hook up to an external display and peripherals.  With the proper native resolution of the display, proper scaling of fonts, etc.  So I can just take my computer everywhere I go.  I'm used to my EEE 900a, with its bullshit 1.6ghz single core ATOM processor - at this point I'm almost certain that my quad core 1.9ghz with 3gb of ram is actually faster.  I would be so happy...they started to kind of do this with the Motorola Atrix, but abandoned it.  I've looked into possibly getting a native X.org compiled, but that looks like it's quite difficult as well. :(   Redeems himself for what exactly?  Acting exactly how a CEO should act, and making sure his company was as profitable as it could be?  What exactly should he be repentant for?  I dislike Microsoft's underhanded strategies just as much as the other guy, but lets be pragmatic here.  Nothing the man has ever done could really be classified as "evil", and his only "mistake" is being a competitor to Linux.   Gnome 3 plebeians...    plug in seatbelt quickly 20 times in a row  This is apparently NOT a joke!  http://www.subaruoutback.org/forums/80-electrical-electronics/2636-disable-seatbelt-chime.html   Honestly, the shit they pulled with Lollipop by locking down certain API functions, and breaking at least some of my apps, means that if I could manage to get a Nexus 6, and _downgrade_ it to KitKat, I would be so happy...   So I know there's a /r/functionalprint - If there were a counter to it, this would certainly be posted.   "Nozzle height"    It does though.  They're all working on commission.  Phone sales reps regularly get bonuses (an extra $20-30 per phone sold) for certain devices, etc.  So they prioritize selling those devices to unsuspecting victims.   It's because Nexus devices aren't preloaded with shit-ware so the phone reps don't get as many bonuses as some other devices when selling them.  This means that nobody ever quite figures out how fucking _amazing_ nexus devices are...only Android "enthusiasts".   You should really learn what the word troll actually means.  Here's a hint: It does not mean "someone I don't agree with".   I mean, if this is your output on an object of this size, then you're good - Those frogs are probably just messy because you're printing them so damn small and as the nozzle hovers over the plastic, it never gets a chance to cool down.  This is pretty close to perfect.  You may simply be printing so slow on the frogs, or so tiny, that you're overextruding due to the PLA getting a chance to heat up and expand - increasing the volumetric output of the filament at such small sizes.  You really don't want to be printing things the size of a penny in the first place.   I've never heard of any 3D printer issues being referred to as "z-gap"...mind explaining what you're referring to?  Edit: Nevermind.  I see what 3DS refers to as "Z-gap" now.  No, I don't think it's indicative of a Z gap issue.   But should more realistically be included in the "cool your plastic as it exits the nozzle" umbrella.   Default is 1.0 extrusion multiplier on slic3r, I find usually a 0.98 works for me as far as pulling extrusion across so that it remains tight across the bridge.   You're overextruding.  This has little or nothing to do with temperature other than likely your hot end is hovering over the piece for too long because you're trying to print things the size of a penny.  Print multiples of this at a time, so that the layer of plastic has a chance to cool, and lower the amount you're extruding by a hair.  You can see islands at the top of the back legs because your nozzle is dragging through the filament.   Laser sintering 3D printers are way more than just the printer.  They have huge operating costs because the volume of the build chamber needs to be filled with an inert gas (argon usually), and even then - afterwards they are generally filled with more metal in a huge furnace with wax sprues that get melted out.  It's just simply not worth it.  You're better off printing in PLA, and paying a local metal casting shop to investment cast the piece.   There aren't many for sale because they're dangerous as shit.   I'd probably get a properly rated adapter for it, plug it in for a couple hours inside a house, and see if it continues to happen.  If it does, time for a replacement.  According to http://www.amazon.com/Whistler-CR85-Performance-Laser-Radar-Detector/dp/B00CM06VIQ - It might actually be new traffic flow sensors that it's detecting.  Keep an eye out on the lines that lights are on.  I know that area has had a lot of new "smart light" stuff installed lately that detects the flow of traffic in order to change lights at times that will save drivers from stopping completely, etc.  It could very well be those new sensors that are triggering it.   Double up on your detection; If you've got a smartphone - fire up Waze.  I've gone without a radar/laser detector for a long while now, and Waze alone has saved me from at least 4 major speeding tickets due to community-based reporting.  I know it's not a solution to your specific issue, just figured I'd recommend an app that's been a huge help to me.  Google bought them, and I know they pull _some_ data into Google Maps like traffic accidents and such, but I'm not sure if they pull police reports/data, so Google Maps may offer this functionality as well - though I haven't checked.   Or alternatively, quit being a thin-skinned crybaby.   Banning people "for being jerks" though is stupid as shit.  It's the internet.  People are going to be jerks.  People here are also (in general) adults...and can handle jerks.  Don't turn this into some pissy-pants kindergarten playground, where everyone must be cordial, and two-faced for the sake of not being banned.  Sometimes people just need to be told to fuck off.  /r/Orlando is the only sub I've seen where people whine and cry like little babies because someone was "rude" (ON THE INTERNET NO LESS!)...I mean holy fucking christ, do we need to wipe their little bottoms after they take a shit as well?   Finkle Einhorn  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFL1UXuHJ-A   This is completely wrong, and a bit ignorant to say the least.  Chip and PIN are just as insecure as mag readers, and can have man in the middle attacks performed against them.  https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/02/man-in-the-midd_1.html  The difference is that, with chip and pin the bank then moves the fault over to you - because you're liable for someone having your PIN, and it's much more difficult to determine that someone has used your card fraudulently.  So in our case, the user of the card gets their money back - and the huge bank that makes billions every year may lose a little bit.  In your case, the user loses his money, and the bank doesn't give a fuuuuck.  They can argue all day that it was you, because the thief "knew" your PIN and you're just trying to get out of payment.   Hahaha, that's awesome.  DeltaMaker has been working on this, and E3D is going to be releasing a hot end soon as well called the "Cyclops".  So it looks like multi-color, single nozzle extrusion with automated filament swaps is now a thing.  E3D also has a blending nozzle that they've shown off, swapping from multiple different colors near instantaneously.  It's a good time to be in the 3D printing industry. :D   Plug a 100k resistor into your thermistor ports and it'll read basically room temp all the time.  If you plug in a 10k, 1k, etc you can get higher temperature readings so that it always thinks it's up to temp.   Replace the USB cable that the raspberry pi uses to talk to whatever board you're using (RAMPS, etc) - also ensure the connectors are nice and secure.  Lots of people here are going to say "ooh but it's such a noisy environment electrically" and while they're not wrong, USB communication isn't that intolerant of noise.  Worst case scenario, you can connect an external FTDI UART chip externally to your board, and communicate that way.   Thank you so much for your comments.  Huge help in tracking down what I will eventually use and/or likely be building.  PSDs, Quadrant detectors, whole slew of stuff I haven't had a chance to look at yet!  You rock!   Are there sensors which work on convergence of a beam of light, or similar?  Or some sort of tiny viewing angle and an angled beam so that distance of the toolhead determines the beams location on the bed?  I've looked for so many different phrasings of "range finder" and "optical distance sensor", etc that perhaps I might be missing the name of a specific technology that I could further find info on.  Or, an optical focuser that uses a short-throw optical lens that adjusts, finds optimal focus of a dot, and determines distance from that?  I've looked for all sorts of ICs that may implement this kind of thing and have come up short handed.   /r/Unexpected    Yeah, in my original post I mentioned these.  Already looked at them.  15mm+/- depending on temperature, etc.  Though what's nice about them is that they do have an interrupt output so you can set a threshold for interrupt.  I already ordered one of the breakouts for them, only like $1.50 for 3 from OSH Park!   When probing, we can slow down to whatever we need.  Fast response isn't needed, it would be nice but it certainly isn't a requirement.   Thank you!!  This is an amazing read!   Large scale CNCs are built on far more rigid platforms.  They're cast-iron, and generally have milled tables to exacting specifications.  This isn't a solved problem for them because they don't compensate for the bed being unlevel or have a requirement for multiple different build surfaces.  The idea being presented here, is a sensor based approach so we can gather data and compensate for machines that have been built to unexact specifications, by users who may or may not have all of the correct tooling to ensure that things are 100% perfectly in-tram, etc.  It makes 3D printers easier to use, without the need for users to spend extraordinary amounts of money to build a working machine.   https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/raddocs/tipvandl.htm   ***Mailboxes are considered federal property***, and federal law (Title 18, United States Code, Section 1705), makes it a crime to vandalize them (or to injure, deface or destroy any mail deposited in them). Violators can be fined up to $250,000, or imprisoned for up to three years, for each act of vandalism.  If you want to sound stupid some more, Title 18 covers pretty much all of it.  Is that too fucking clear for you?   How about citing federal law then, smartass: https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/raddocs/tipvandl.htm  Mailboxes are considered federal property, and federal law (Title 18, United States Code, Section 1705), makes it a crime to vandalize them (or to injure, deface or destroy any mail deposited in them). Violators can be fined up to $250,000, or imprisoned for up to three years, for each act of vandalism.   Nothing in your link relates to ownership at all.  You are incorrect for these reasons: http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/2lrt8p/hes_been_hitting_on_me_for_a_month_now_and_lied/cly1pkf   So, would also having a high-bit ADC help with the accuracy of a sensor such as this as well?  I'm thinking of testing this with a 24-bit ADC in order to increase resolution.   http://www.answers.com/Q/Does_the_US_Postal_Service_own_your_mailbox     http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2010/04/postal_service_controls_the_ou.html      http://www.residential-mailboxes.net/mailbox-laws-and-regulations/law-for-residential-mail-box   Homeowners need to be aware that even though they purchased and maintain the residential mailbox, the mailbox belongs to and is controlled by the USPS (United States Postal Service).  That means that any tampering of the mailbox is a federal offense.  Yes they do.  Might want to do a little bit of research before you wrongly go arguing with someone.   [Higher quality sauce](http://i.imgur.com/qQx7eKq.jpg)   Note: It's only a federal offense because the government owns your mailbox.  Don't believe me?  Go check your mailbox.  It will have a stamp on it stating it is property of the federal government.  This is basically what they ended up having to do in order to make mail theft a federal offense, vs just stealing.  I'm not sure that stealing a package off of a front door step would violate those laws; though I'd love a lawyer to chime in.   To think, it only took a class action lawsuit!   The reprap 3d printing community has begun using various sensors to detect build surfaces, and apply mathematical corrections to mechanical movements in order to make printing easier for new users (no having to adjust beds, etc)  Right now, there's a move to inductive touchless sensors, as larger build volumes have a tendency to flex against mechanical touch probes, etc.  I'm here looking for ideas on sensors I could use, hoping that someone here has perhaps worked on a similar problem in the past and might be able to recommend a sensor or type of sensor technology that I can do further research into.  The qualities I need to have in a sensor include: They need to be accurate; 0.1mm repeatable measurement with minimal drift.  They need to be able to detect multiple different types of surfaces (glass, PCB substrate, metal, and acrylic).  They need to have suitable measurement distances to remain out of the way of the printing toolhead while remaining small enough to fit near it.  And last, they need to remain unaffected (or minimally affected) by ambient light, humidity, and temperature(s of between 20C and 30-40C).  Would a simple IR reflector, after some calibration, be able to achieve repeatable enough results?  I worry that ambient light would throw it off.  Reflectivity of the material is fine to calibrate for, but having to calibrate it based on ambient light changes is way too much to ask people to do.  I've looked at the VL6180X, but that's certainly not even in the range of accuracy I need it seems.  Everything from voltage to temperature can cause it to vary by 15mm or more if I'm reading the datasheet correctly.  I was intrigued by it because it used "time of flight" reading and wasn't changed too much because of material reflectivity.  Inductive sensors don't allow to people to print on materials such as glass, acrylic, and PCB due to such short measurement distances (without blowing the sensor up to huge dimensions in order to increase the measurement range and read a metal bed under the printing surface)  Capacitive sensors?  Worth looking at?  They seem like they should work, but I worry about humidity, temperature, etc affecting them too wildly.  It's been suggested to me that these might not be a good solution either.  Any opinions on this type of sensor are welcome.  Sonar proximity sensors I've attempted to use are way too noisy/inaccurate.  And I'm unaware of any LIDAR sensors that are small enough to get where I'm looking to mount a sensor  Are there any other sensor technologies I'm missing out there that fit some/most these criteria?  Obviously mechanical measurement doesn't have the drawbacks of the touchless systems, but it means mechanical deployment, retraction of a probe, etc.  ***edit:*** The community as well as myself, have also used the metal nozzle with force sensitive resistors under the build surface, but they're not supposed to be stored "under load" or they deform over time, ruining your measurements.  Another thing we've used is using the metal nozzle against a metal bed, but that has the drawbacks of molten plastic messing up readings, and again - only being able to utilize a solid metal surface.   Certainly, but I've seen people try to do much weirder things.   Well, shit - I never got around to watching that.  Looks like I've gotta get on that.   That's the jist of it, yeah.  Great for things that don't need a lot of data throughput, like temp logging, etc.  But you're not going to use it to download and store large files, etc.   So a lot of people really liked the dual saber or "staff", which was also really cool when it separated into two separate units.  That made me think, that I'd also really like to see someone with dual light saber daggers, where the user (likely an assassin) holds them in a backwards fashion ([like this](http://i.imgur.com/0weptnd.jpg) and likes to be very up close and personal with them.)   Wow, your 3 year old is fucking dumb.  Like...dumber than a typical 2 year old.   It's almost like pop culture is everywhere!  Who would have thought?!   It's probably more apt to say "$5 UART to WiFi bridge" so that people understand you're still limited to UART speeds, etc.  But, it's pretty capable as its own microcontroller as well.   /r/isthisatrollor   You can fuck right off.  The damn show is on Nick.com - the episodes regarding this have been out for easily a month now.  Freely available to anyone and everyone.   I'd like to include that this is the same for deltamaker.  We just did our standard testing, they got the same machines that our customers get.  Though that may not stay true for long, as we tend to iterate rapidly and just roll things into shipping.    To some, it is literally the only thing that matters _enough_ to get them out to vote in the first place.  Pushing people just to vote on Amendment 2, helps get them voting on...say...the governor, which they wouldn't have done before.    I used to use this a while back, and it doesn't seem to splatter all over the frequencies as you suggest.   http://www.faberdashery.co.uk/products-page/print-materials/electric-blue/ - 3mm, 115meters is about 1kg, and it's 42.00 or $67.14 USD/kg/734cc (as they calculate it)  http://www.makerjuice.com/product/gplus/ - G+ is only $55/1 liter or 1000cc  https://ultimachine.com/content/abs-175mm-black-1kg-spool - $46/1kg spool.  http://shop.printbl.com/products/3mm-pla-filament-1kg-spool - $43/1kg spool.  (btw, these are the only filament manufacturers I will use, due to their quality)  So if I brought the lower price, quality filament for PLA that I use, or a similar spool of ABS, up to the 1000cc (assuming 1kg = 734cc of material) then the $43 spool would be 1000/743 = 1.36 (required multiplier to get up to 1000cc of material); $43 x 1.36 = $58.  The G+ is $3 cheaper than the PrintBL filament.  Resin printing is not the crazy wallet-burning beast that it once used to be.  As far as weight/strength - it's better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t6deOZloBU   http://makezine.com/projects/make-38-cameras-and-av/raspberry-pirate-radio/  Like, holy crap extends way past FCC regulations.  If you've got an empty channel, you can do line of sight at like 100m.  If it's on the most popular channel in the city, you will hear the Pi over the popular channel at like 5-10 ft.   It was actually decided out of engineering practicality.  They're using an LCD, with a UV backlight.  They needed an LCD without any kind of color filters (monochrome) so they look like they're using a repurposed nokia display.   Your information is a little bit out of date.  Resin from MakerJuice is on-par with quality ABS filament in terms of price.  Resin printing is not significantly more expensive than FDM printing any longer...it's actually about the same.

I bought last mid-week and haven't received shipping notification yet. Mine will probably come the week of the 15th as well.  They're shipping UPS, which I suspect is UPS Ground, which is pretty slow.  They ship from just outside of Boston and I'm west coast so it'll be a 5-day trek for my order.   Old safes used asbestos for their fire proofing material. It's banned in A LOT of countries because it causes mesothelioma (cancer).  It's also found in insulation in older houses (along with lead paint and lead pipes). It's nasty stuff you don't want to inhale.  I'd inspect the safe to look for any cracks or breaks for asbestos to "leak" out of. The safe looks in very good condition, but you don't want to fuck around with asbestos.   $16.23.   Normally, I'd suggest to find out how thick the door and walls are but the seller probably can't tell you accurately.  I'd go with how heavy is it? Heavy is better as that = more steel.  If you have to move this up or down stairs, you're probably going to need a crew.  Due to the age, it might/probably has asbestos. It looks in good/sealed condition, but it's something I'd physically inspect to see if there is any dust leakage. (check underneath, too).

I'm not home to accept/sign for the package.  I have this silly thing called a job. My wife is not home and couldn't sign for the package, either. She's silly as well. My dog is home, but the UPS driver would be like "hey there, cutie pie can you sigh right....OH MY GOD, MY ARM!!!!"  It's over 20 miles (one way) from where I live to where I have to go to pick up UPS deliveries (and I live in a major metro area).  This is where their plant is that I have to pick shit up at. So that's 40+ miles round trip. It's 42.x miles from memory. It's a major hassle to be honest. Time = money.  I'm not the youtuber in the "apmex scam" video I recently posted here, just sharing that.  Bottom line is USPS is incredibly more convenient for me due to where I live. Plus, any theft of USPS becomes a federal offense, unlike a UPS or FedEx theft. So it has that going for it as well.

Most people don't even think about the fact that your front door is "secured" by 1-2 inches of pine wood (look where your deadbolt goes into the frame).  No on realizes how **ridiculously easy it is to kick in a front door**, most people have a real delusion of safety and security when it comes to locking their front door. Pine wood is not strong.  A security door is the best visual deterrent/investment you can make for home security, IMO.  It basically tells the scumbags "my neighbor is an easier target."  The best deterrent is to not send out an invitation.   From their [ebay store FAQ](http://stores.ebay.com/baypreciousmetals/faq.html):   Q: What are your shipping methods?   A: Bay Precious Metals orders are shipped either US Postal Service or UPS. Each purchase is fully insured at no extra cost and may require an adult signature upon delivery.  So UPS must work out better for them as they replied to me saying:  Your order will be shipped via UPS as that is our current shipping carrier we are using.  They don't appear to be using USPS anymore, despite their FAQ.   They may not have a traditional brick and mortar store.  From their [ebay store FAQ](http://stores.ebay.com/baypreciousmetals/faq.html):   Q: Where do you ship from?   A: Bridgewater, Massachusetts *(this is south of Boston)*  Googling "bay precious metals massachusetts" doesn't give much. I doubt they have a physical presence.  Here's the customer service number that was in their email signature from my ebay email to them if anyone is interested:  888-960-4880   I'm not worried, they're essentially buying feedback with their auctions at this point, IMO.  Plus, paypal.   I just placed an order with them a couple days ago.  I can tell you they ship out exclusively UPS, USPS is not an option (as they state on their FAQ).  I emailed them through ebay asking if they could send my order out via USPS as UPS is literally over 40 miles round trip to go pick things up (incredibly inconvenient).  They replied they only use UPS.  Here's where it gets better...  They said there would be no signature required on the delivery.  This is a $900 order that they seem to have no problem having left at someone's door.  I replied to them via ebay with my concerns and never heard back.  At least I have paypal protection. I'm not worried as I'm confident I won't be left holding the bag should anything happen with my package left on my doorstep for hours.  I have not received any shipping notification/tracking. I'm expecting a "delivery" on the 12th or perhaps the 15th.  If I remember right, they're in Massachusetts and they're probably using UPS Ground, so that would most likely be a 5 day delivery for me (I'm west coast).  Regardless, I won't use them again due to them shipping UPS.  The $ I save on an order is not enough for the hassle of going to go pick up a UPS delivery.  Who wants to jump into rush hour traffic after work to get to the UPS plant before they close the customer service desk?  Then get right back in that traffic to go home. It just isn't worth it to me.  I'm a USPS guy all the way, I can ride my bike down and pick things up. Plus any theft becomes a federal offense.    Australia gets everything.

Let's be honest, the best and brightest don't go into delivering mail.   Your best bet is to fake your own death and assume the identity of someone who has recently died (check your local obituaries). I've done this several times, it's easier than you think. Plus, I get to live out my actor fantasy every couple of years. It's great fun living out various backstories I create while heavily inebriated.  Pro tip: make sure you select a deceased person of the same sex. Watch out for anyone named Pat, Leslie, Tracy, Jamie and make sure it's Danny, not Danni.  Best of luck to you, Morgan.   **Any** vendor can do the same thing.  Don't think you're any safer ordering directly anywhere else.  I think the lesson here is to really be cognizant of this situation. If you want purchase protection use your credit card or stick to ebay/paypal.  I have a feeling if that youtuber had gone through an APMEX ebay auction, that first "scam" video would have been a "paypal saves the day with a refund as APMEX denies claim" video and that would have been the end of it.   It still would have been a major hassle for him but it sounds like he has a slam dunk with the postal inspector. I'd be really surprised if paypal didn't side with the buyer in that case, despite having the package "delivered" confirmation from the post office.

The tracking number will be provided via email to you upon date of shipment.  **Is my package insured while in transit?**  American Precious Metals Exchange fully insures all of its shipments. Should anything happen while your package is in transit to you it will be covered by our insurance policy. However, we will not accept responsibility if you have left instructions with any carriers or delivery service to leave parcels un-attended for you without the need for a signature. Or, you have given them instructions to leave your package with someone else such as a building manager, neighbor, drop-off location such as Mail Boxes etc. The UPS Store, etc. When we ship to you, if metals are lost or damaged in transit, it is our responsibility to pursue any claim with the insurance company. If we determine the package is lost or damaged, we file a claim. We reserve the right to re-ship your items or refund your money at our discretion.

And 2 engelhard bars with sequential numbers and a logo next to the name engelhard of a small circle with a U shape  Kind of sounds like you're describing their bullshead logo.  Did it [look like this](http://www.images-apmex.com/images/Catalog%20Images/Products/61708_Obv.jpg?v=20130101120000 width=450 height=450).      I believe they do take paypal and I imagine the exchange works behind the scenes based on your address/country when you register an account with them.  I've never purchased directly from them before, however.      I'm going for it, if I remember, that is :)  I'm sure it'll play out like last time, though, get in the queue and all sold out by the time I come up to the counter.  Thanks for the heads up.   Thank God they're still making the magnets.      I love watching his channel, it's the same ol' folks saying the same ol' end game.  I do like Paul Craig Roberts, though.   UPDATE 12:02 pm on May 28th: The Portland Police has just released the following update on this collision:  The tow truck driver has been identified as 40-year-old Jolene Friedow of Estacada. Friedow works for North Portland Towing.  The investigation into the crash is ongoing. Investigators have learned that Angeles was riding his bicycle westbound on Southeast Gladstone Street, approaching the intersection with Cesar E. Chavez Boulevard. Friedow was facing eastbound, towing another vehicle, waiting to turn left (northbound) on Cesar E. Chavez Boulevard. Friedow turned left, colliding with Angeles in the intersection.  I'm surprised this was a fatality. Truck was waiting to turn, when turned collided with the cyclist. Both the truck and the cyclist couldn't have been going that fast, was the cyclist wearing a helmet? Did he go underneath the truck?   I wouldn't buy anything less than a 1/2 oz for the same reason and I'd have to get that on a very good deal.  I'd just save up for 1 oz, which I recently did.   I'm listening to Queensryche at the moment, is that close enough?   Why are you watching Blackberry?   Bought my first gold over the weekend via MCM ebay.  Gold is down $16.70 as I type this, doing some shopping around, it looks like I'm down about $3 on my AGE purchase.  Spot dives aren't bad if you can get a decent deal on the premium.   Disappointment?      So expect many high powered salesman to call you at the dinner hour.  Pro tip: Don't recognize a #? Don't answer the phone.               Are the wings supposed to be tire treads?  I can't figure out what the 1 is. Is it supposed to be the track? The 5 being gray seems odd to me as well.  I'm not even drunk (yet), either.   I'm in enterprise-land, working for a large company, we drop support when browsers drop below 5%.          var date = new Date();     var n = date.toDateString();     var time = date.toLocaleTimeString();      document.getElementById('time').innerHTML = n + ' ' + time;  **Note: these functions aren't fully cross browser supported**   My strategy is:  * Lottery tickets * Timeshares * Silver * Powerbars * Faking own death/insurance fraud      I'd like to put in a pond in my back yard. How does  ~2,000 square feet, tiered levels going from 1' down to 6' sound?  I'll need the dug out dirt pile arranged artisically for the waterfall. I'm thinking an elephant's head, but I'm open to your ideas. I can supply the fish at the end, so you don't have to worry about that.   Well where am I supposed to go now when I tell my wife it's crunch time at work and I need to work OT, I'll be a couple hours late for dinner.   If the dev didnt understand something or I wasnt clear enough I dont see why he didn't immediately bring the issue up.  There was an obvious disconnect because here we are.  Communication problems are not one-sided, they can happen at either end, as I'm sure you're well aware.  You should both be agreeing/confirming what you're discussing, don't just communicate via fire and forget, i.e., "communication was constant" (meaning you told him blah, blah and blah, where he heard blah, blah and yada yada). You should be verifying all parties are on the same page.  Confirm what you discuss at the end of verbal communication.  Follow-up in writing as well where it can be read/re-confirmed (though you don't need to do this all the time).       Your object namespace is the simplest way to modularize your code. I would go with that.  I'd also probably look into a build system and front load everything (minimized), but that's just me (personal preference), unless there is a compelling reason to lazy load.   Code doesn't do what I want it to do.   Monkey see, monkey do.   Your problem is communication then. You should spend more time on it and if you're doing it solely over IM/email, you're definitely doing it wrong.  I've been in this industry since literally the mid 90s, the #1 problem I've seen and still see to this day is communication.   * http://photoshopetiquette.com/ * http://uxmovement.com/resources/6-tips-for-a-smooth-hand-off-from-designer-to-developer/ * http://methodandcraft.com/articles/streamlining-the-handoff * http://twosixcode.com/notes/view/items-to-consider-when-preparing-a-psd-for-handoff-to-a-web-developer     I've used that at a past job, had no idea you can record it. Taking a look I see they're charging for some enhanced features, I wondered when they would start doing that.  I've got some software leads to checkout which are much better than their $15/month for recording functionality.  Thanks for the info, though. BTW, interesting videos, you should keep making/posting them.      Off topic, but what are you using for your screen recording?   Christ, I moved a couple kilos of coke on the MAX just last week.  Just act cool, man.   It's pretty annoying that you need to cross the street then cross back to keep going  lol. I want to break into your house and open every box of cereal from the bottom of the box.   Didn't read (because I don't care), but what does a "football star" have to do with this issue?   What are all the languages and frameworks that a front-end dev is expected to know?  All of them.   Wanting to make quality work is noble but the OP needs to realize their career is in business, not art.  Start refusing client requirements and they will go elsewhere, their future work will be elsewhere, referrals will be elsewhere, etc.  Not every piece needs to be in a portfolio. Your mortgage/rent comes every month, however.   http://www.ally.com/  Co-worker was just mentioning them (I'd never heard of them before), anyone have any long-term experience and opinions with them?  They're offering 1% on an online savings account (though the APY is variable), doesn't look to be any real restrictions from what I can see. This is the only thing that jumps out at me, but I don't think it would be an issue for me:  *You can make six withdrawals and transfers per statement cycle from your Online Savings Account. The limit is set by federal law for electronic and telephone transactions from all U.S. savings and money market accounts. Please remember, you will be charged a $10 fee for each transaction that exceeds this limit.*  They have no physical branches but I don't think that would be a real problem for me, either.  I'd still have my checking with Chase so I wouldn't be putting all my financial eggs into the Ally basket, so to speak.           Easy, you don't even need jQuery:      var frontend_developer = true;       import life from "life";      life(function() {         console.log("I just bought a boat, guys! And I'm a retard");     });    Not to be all elitist design snobby, but some of them aren't that bad.   [I went sailing](http://i.imgur.com/kq1jr5f.jpg) the other weekend.   * Quit job * Buy Macbook * ??? * Profit!   You've given them your opinion and you're there to provide $ervice$ to them, what's the problem?       Then have him over to help do some landscaping this Saturday because that's what friends do. It isn't about money.   *I* wouldn't do one, but that's *my* personal choice based on the resources I have available for them to make a determination.  They want me to spend time (some times a lot), but they won't spend time (I'm talking 10-15 minutes) to look through my github and ask just one *thoughtful* question.    They can ask anything they want but I don't have to jump through their hoops as there are plenty of jobs out there.  Bottom line is if you have options, you exercise them.

[Here's mine](http://www.romania-insider.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/chart-down-money-sxc-1024x580.jpg), let me know if you want a google sheet version, because sheet is what I say every time I look at it.   I just learned that my xhtml needs to be well-formed.  It took me a couple weeks just to learn what well-formed means.  If you're available to chat throughout the day, I'd love to ping you, I'm having problems with some document.layers code I'm writing. I don't think it's using BEM, though my indentation might be off.   I would not do an interview assignment.  If they can't make a decision based on my github, my work history and their lame, very possibly multiple interviews, they can go fuck themselves.  An interview assignment is a contract-to-hire position, IMO.   50!! its only May..  Stop bitching and start Githubbing your life away. We can't get to 51 without you, slacker.   I know one solution is to just say something like I have minimum $50 fee for any small bullshit but I feel like that would be a really bitchy thing to say.  This is why you'll fail at business.   I did this effect on my first Angular app.  Quite frankly, I'm still impressed at what behavior CSS can do.     	200

WHEN THIS SHIT HITS 2.32 I'M GOING TO SAMS CLUB AND BUYING SOME FUCKING INDUSTRIAL SIZED BOXES OF CEREAL AND FUCKING PIZZA ROLLS #YOUonlyOWNamdONCE   *slaps* Don't be such a pussy. I'm still in, stay strong!!! We're going to be rich!!!!   Yeah I didn't know that until about a week ago. You know who told me about Garmins dope smart watches? My grandmother. #YOLODOLO   Stupid fucking 3 days settling   True. I just could never understand GoPro. It's a camera company with a one trick pony. I think the people that would use one, have it. I think 5Y down the road it will look a lot like Garmin does now. With that said, I know you're not investing for 5y down the road, hope you make bank.   Don't trust it. Don't like it. Won't play with it.    Do you know a Soros or a Buffett?   First off, thank you. Second. I went ahead and for shits and giggles repurchased around .30 (only $500 worth) but I was curious if this was going to go all willy wonka after-hours and in the morning and I'm fine with losing $500.    I'm still in   You have prophets, fuck, where do you buy those?    Riding this money train with you brother. Are we taking out my yacht or yours? I've got $2,000 at 2.30 = GONNA BE A THOUSANDAIRE TOMORROW !!!   I saw about 60 million people running off the bridge jumping for a full day and I couldn't see exactly where they were jumping but I could hear them going WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, so at the very end of the day I decided to jump. It was a really fun ride but I went back up and there was 62 million people jumping today but the bridge just felt different so I decided to ask whats down there this time. But once again... I decided fuck it and jumped. I pray you hear me yelling Weeeeeee in the morning.     After Hours is looking positive.   NO.   Second question, I know nobody truly knows with a stock this volatile but what should people be looking at to help indicate the direction of this stock?  Thank you!   Oh great leaders where the hell is this one headed? I've jumped out and jumped back in. Debating keeping it overnight, I figured I would see what great advice I could receive to continue to YOLO.   I've got $2,000 just sitting around on AMD for the last week or so at $2.30.  *high five*   I hope so. I showed up late to the party and ended up losing money. I bought back in at $5.95. Hoping to recoup my losses and maybe a little in the morning.   How does today end? I'm tempted to jump in right before the day closes out.   How do I get in on this?    No I hesitantly gave him the card and stood over his shoulder watching him. I wish I had a cooler story but basically he explained the law and I acted nonchalant while also googling the law on my phone and realized we probably weren't being robbed.    You know nothing John Snow!!!!!!   I was passing through New Jersey with my girlfriend and we stopped to get gas. I legitimately thought the guy was trying to steal my girlfriends credit card.   Garett Richards.. It was a great day.    This was the closest thing I could find to an appropriate place to post this:  How much do you think I should sell my LG 47LX9500. It's hardly been used, I really mean that. Probably turned on once every 3 months. I could use it but if I could sell it for a decent amount, I don't watch enough TV to really care and would just buy something cheaper.   Thanks   I sure as hell hope it doesn't because I've purchased ~~a lot of it's stock today~~, well a lot for me.    You killed it today with AVEO    Yeah I only spent $500 so I just don't really care and I'm riding it down.   Bought in at 7.25 and it just keeps dropping, should I take my losses?  	31

 I think that's Black Rock Shooter but I may be wrong.   It goes pretty fast and it's a bit confusing at times.   I'm not trying to say the Tatami Galaxy is a bad anime but after watching the first few minutes I could hardly stomach the animation and the dialouge. What did you guys find enjoyable in the Tatami Galaxy?   Paranoia Agent and Perfect Blue were both made by Satoshi Kon who's pretty well known for his psychological thrillers.   Welcome to the NHK!   Try Welcome to the NHK! It's a very unique anime as it's a mixture of a lot of different genres. It has dark comedy with romance but it's also pretty psychological. I think you will like it if you're into a darker yet comedic kind of anime.   Another anime I highly recommend is Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. I see you've seen Another and Mirai Nikki so I have a feeling you might like Higurashi.    Welcome to the NHK   I've seen Rainbow Nisha a year ago and I agree that it was a great anime. I can see the similarities it shares with TTGL but the difference is TTGL has more of a lasting impression. That doesn't mean Rainbow Nisha is a bad anime, it's just the over the top scenes in TTGL is hard to forget. Same reason why Kill la Kill still sticks in my mind to this day.   Welcome to the NHK!!   Welcome to the NHK!   Hey guys. This might be buried but for any of you guys who are going through some tough stressful times, I highly recommend Welcome to the NHK. Its an extremely heartfelt and beautiful story that anyone can enjoy. No anime has made me laugh and cry as many times as this series has!!   Yes but its not completely updated   I've actually seen all of them!   Now that I'm done watching Welcome to the NHK, I can't help but feel a bit empty. This anime is definitely one of my favorites!! Do you have any recommendations for shows like this?   I just finished watching the show last night and the ending was extremely touching. I knew Misaki had her own problems but I felt the whole therapy session with Sato was more of her trying to help herself. In a way Misaki needed Sato more than he needed her. Other than that, I felt Misaki was an incredibly strong female character. She was able to surpress her own problems while at the same time try to help Sato with his issues. My heart literally sank when she gave Sato the contract, pledging that Sato will be there for her at all times, and Sato refused. I know if I was Sato, I would've accepted and signed the contract but logically Sato did the right thing. He knew that he was in no position or condition to help Misaki so he didn't agree to it. In a way, Welcome to the NHK was a beautiful anime and it really does remind you about important life lessons. When it comes down to the end of the day, only you can solve your own problems.   No problem! I'm actually going through some troubling and stressful times right now as well and watching Welcome to the NHK has definitely helped me although I can't help but to feel depressed knowing that I'm almost done with this series.   I started watching the series 2 days ago and I'm almost done. I can already feel the depression sinking in. I DONT WANT THE SERIES TO END!! I love every single character especially Misaki!   Yess!! Elfen Lied was another big one that also left me depressed for a few weeks.   It could be any anime, no matter what genre it is. For me, it has to be Higurashi no Naku Koro ni however I think it'll change after I'm done watching Welcome to the NHK.   Yesss!! I started watching this series 2 days ago and now I'm almost done with it. Before I started it, I thought it was going to be just another comedy/slice of life/romance anime but I quickly found out it was much more than that. No anime has ever made me laugh and cry this many times.   Welcome to the NHK. I started about 2 days ago and now I'm almost done with the whole series. It truly is a great anime series and it really hits close to home.       Lauren Aquilina - King   I died watching anime or more specifically Welcome to the NHK. No regrets :D   Glad you like it! EDM is actually a pretty big genre itself. In it there is subgenres like Progressive House, Dubstep, Trance, etc. If you really liked Sad Machine you should try out some of Porter Robinson's other songs: Lionhearted, Divinity, Years of War. I'm trying to think of other artists like him but I'm kind of drawing a blank at the moment.   I like pretty much all genres but my favorite genre is EDM.   You should try Porter Robinson - [Sad Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAIDqt2aUek)      Jeremy!   The fight between Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann against the Anti-Spirals in the last episode. I have never seen a fight so over the top yet so epic.    I regret not working hard enough. I'm going to be a senior next year in high school and looking back I haven't been that amazing of a student. Even though a lot of my classmates think I'm smart because I get slightly above average grades that doesn't mean I'm a hardworker. In reality, I procrastinate everything til the last minute and spend most of my time aimlessly on the internet.    A dead mother brain fucker!      [Libera Me From Hell - Gurren Lagann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykSZXQNIUKg)   That was the most beautiful and useful advice anyone has given to me in my life.      If you were to play any other role besides ADC what role would you choose. Also, what's your favorite top, mid, adc, jungle, and adc champ?   Your Soul? Ouch.   how?       /r/incest   It took me a while to understand it too but if you look up what a Turing test is, it will make a lot more sense. Basically, a Turing Test is a test that measures a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. So, if a machine is able to pass it would mean they're capable of human intelligence and thought. But at the same time, if they're capable of human intelligence then they would also know the consequences of passing the test therefore, they would purposely fail it to prevent us humans from discovering their intelligence.   TLDR: your computer is actually just as smart as you, it just doesn't want you to find out.   eat   The feeling of loneliness and drifting away from your friends.   Thanks man! That's still my goal today!   I'd be a ultra cool shinobi who can use shadow clone jutsu.      Am I the only one who doesn't know any of these songs?   ketsu wo taberu   More days in a month. More months in a year. More years in your life?   Reminds me of Ekko from League of Legends      Eugene   k   can someone please tell me what it seriously is though. I'm too scared to click   In elementary or middle school. It always sucks when you would work your ass off for a good grade on a test when someone you knew who barely studied or did any work in class somehow earned a better grade than you. It gets even worse in high school as the competitiveness increases by tenfold. I practiced and went to several SAT classes and I could barely muster a 1890. A classmate of mine didn't even prepare for the test and earned a 2070 on his first try. This just goes to show that hard work doesn't always pay off.   "ur gay"  	56

My grandmother did something similar a year or two ago. She bought an old book from a garage sale and found a confederate bill in one of the pages.

Then a giant worm came out of my pool and ate everyone. After I woke up I was scared to come downstairs for a few days.   The newspaper chose not to name the site but explained it was contacted by women claiming their photographs were not only being shown without their permission but were also being offered up for downloading.   To this I read headline today which says... PM Modi ka haath, Lalit Modi ke saath :P   "You shouldn't try, you probably won't get it."  A girl once told me that in high school when I asked her if I should inquire about being captain for my school's ROV team. She wasn't even joking, that statement alone likely says more about her personality than anything else. Needless to say, it really lit a fire under my ass and I was captain for my last two years of high school.   I remember her every time I wonder whether I should do something I'm unsure of.   Why is your nose shaped like that?   Good Luck!!!      I don't have an opinion any different from if you were to ask me what do you think of black people. They are all just people, who have diverse personalities.   NFL: Baseball   I was at work in Leeds.   Hmmm. That's a tough one! I can't say there is one proud moment that stands out above the rest. It's just all the little things that I've done that bring people a smile, a laugh or that make their lives easier somehow. I just love to hear people laugh! If I can make someone's day better, I just made myself proud. How 'bout you OP? What's your proudest moment?   I slipped on the wet floor in my friends bathroom and cracked my head open on the toilet and ended up unconscious. Which also meant I P S'd myself. Sigh.   I always say food poisoning.

 No. Lost actually wrapped up all of its characters' stories...apart from Walt's.   Eight years, actually :(   It's been going without any problems like this for its entire run. Not counting any quality issues, you can't argue that the show hasn't continued to *exist*. The voice cast is the heart of the show.   If either Dan Castellaneta or Hank Azaria follow on, I think we have a dying show on our hands.   Wise in certain terms, notably quality-wise (in the opinion of some).   Creep is a bad song.   Nick Fury got a new eye patch? I liked the sunglasses from Winter Soldier + the S1 finale of AoS. Thought he'd go with them for longer.   [Sorry to break it to you, but...](http://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/35hdpx/deactivating_marvelawards_the_friendly/)   Ohhh...   They're *clearly* referring to **Orange is the New Black**.   Yeah with all of that human trafficking and sexual abuse. That's cross-marketing for you.   The exact comment they linked to says to post it here specifically to "rake in the karma". Therefore, star for honesty.   People only thought he might be in Black Panther because they thought he might be Everett Ross.   Captain Lorde?   He confirmed that he knew when it was filming and in between CW and IW he'll be doing side projects - he didn't *specifically* say he'd be in it, just implied. He's possibly misleading us.   To be fair, her face looks pretty elongated too...not even that much like her.   I heard Ultron would kill Pepper, causing Iron Man to fly off into space and arrive during Guardians 2.   !star for honesty.   *I broke my boy.*     So glad to see Jonathan Banks getting some love.   Where the hell has Josh Peck been?   Cheers, I'll know better next time.   *"and you know it"*? I think they might, considering it's literally their entire comment.   EVRYBODY BETRAY ME I FED UP WITH THIS WORLL'   He literally shrunk himself down using real technology borrowed from Edgar Wright's Ant-Man development and fit inside the clay IRL. Such a talented actor.   Random fact: Jonny Greenwood wrote the film scores for both There Will Be Blood and Inherent Vice. He's also a kickass fucking guitarist.   Wow. The voters today are pretty naive. I got the reference.   *Underrated* means it isn't thought of highly enough by those who've seen it - that it's under-appreciated. Exposure doesn't factor into whether something's under or overrated.   Hey, woah, since when was Almost Famous bland?    Hey, Almost Famous!     In other news, The Artist?!   /r/kyle    It's different, sure, but I really liked it when I watched it. This Bond was a straight-up cold blooded motherf---er who could feed a dude to sharks, burn a man to death and doom Benicio del Toro to being *literally ground to a pulp*, then go for a romantic dip with his lady. Bond to both extremes. Maybe not what most would want, but it's enjoyable to watch.   The *X-Men United* subtitle was definitely only used in North America. Everywhere else, it's only referred to as X2 or X-Men 2. I have no doubt the word *Men* was everywhere, as my original comment was a joke.   True :)      Although I'm 90% sure that title only exists in North America.   [Forgetting something?](http://www.impawards.com/2003/posters/x_men_two_ver1.jpg)   I wrote a high school essay about this review! It's hilarious.     Edit: the review is hilarious, not the essay   Both are awesome. I personally think 2 is way overrated. Too many characters, overstuffed plot, most of it doesn't matter by the end because we came to watch the epic fight scenes. It's still great, but way too long.   The film's been test-screening for *over a year* and I've heard absolutely nothing but praise. Can't wait!   Benedoctor Cumberstrange, then Fassassin's Creed a month later! Don't forget about X-Men Origins: Magic Mike!   [spoilers](#s "Not to mention Ward in an instant became a faaaaarrr more interesting character almost immediately when he turned out to be Hydra.")   [Spoilers](#s "Clarifying what others are saying: Technically, the gem/stone is IN the scepter. The scepter harnesses the gem's power.")   It's kind of a thing where the first ten of so episodes of Season 1 are pretty weak, but the characters begin to really grow on you; and by the end of the Winter Soldier episode (which has its own twist that makes the series itself much better) the implications for the entire team make you really want to keep watching.   Definitely, because during Toretto's fake death that was clearly Paul.   "Marvel" referring to Shazam, right?   Nope, he's definitely playing electric in the music video.   Watch [*American Beauty*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/)!   Tyler Durden was the antagonist though. Norton and Durden were two characters in one, and Durden was a manipulative psychopathic hypocrite.    Worked for me in Alien Blue. Just took 15 seconds to load up.   Damn it, why didn't I think of that?   *George Miller's "Sad Hands", coming to a theatre near you*   **BET YOUR BOTTOM DOLLAR**- shit, wrong film.   No, it *is* two days ago.   What about a movie...that you drink?!   Three times too.   ayyytham lmao   Inhumans is IMO the most likely.          Ant-Man? No. Civil War? Of course not. Benedoctor Cumberstrange? No. Guardians 2? Never. New Spider-Man? Slightly more likely, but not very. Thor 3? Loki's in it, so no. Infinity War Pt.1? Never. Black Panther? He'll already be an Avenger, so no. Captain Marvel? I'm going to say no. Infinity War Pt 2? Never in a million years.          The last one on the slate is Inhumans - people might be fatigued enough to have stopped caring by this point.   That entire show is on YouTube via Marvel's official channel if anyone wants to marathon it.   Isn't he supposed to be in Civil War first, though?   Spider-Man: The New Avenger? I think it's too much. I was fine with The Spectacular Spider-Man   IGN listed that as their second least favourite ep of the series, for god knows why. Second LOST episode I ever watched. Loved it.   Does [the title track of Kid A](https://youtu.be/7RwvZSfLUXM) *not* make *anyone else* want to kill themselves? Probably the most emotionally draining piece of music I've ever heard.     Aside from that, [Optimistic](https://youtu.be/-q4zz6HvdiM), [Idioteque](https://youtu.be/DNqv3nHyteM), [Packt Like Sardines](https://youtu.be/RU8slEG-OtM), [You and Whose Army?](https://youtu.be/gAUMgureA6o) and [Life in a Glasshouse](https://youtu.be/upl_rxmsu6s) are some of the most refreshing alternative rock, electronic or jazz songs out there.   Most of the Ultron trailer monologuing was trailer-exclusive. In the first trailer, he's terrifying, whereas in the movie, he's simply very serviceably menacing rather than scary.   Oooooops I apologise   Scarlet Witch, though a bit bland, was fantastic to look at.   He loved Guardians, so I guess he's warming up to them.   There's a lot less blue, though.   (edit: fixed line)     *I'm gonna show you something beautiful: everyone screaming...for mercy.*     If only that line was actually in the movie...   What spelling errors?   But that random shot of a Gillette branded shaving cream bottle in front, out of focus while [spoilers](#s "Widow reveals she was sterilised")... A bit distracting.   Hate to be that guy, but you accidentally put *Rises* in the title.   In NZ and Aus, it's only an M - our equivalent of PG-13. No age restriction, just recommended for more mature audiences. Same with the two sequels, plus all of the Terminator movies, and the second Alien movie.   OR it's the quirky sequel to Falling Down.   SPIDER-MAN DIES, TONY AND BRUCE GET MARRIED, RHODEY GETS A SEX CHANGE.    Oops, spoilers   Are you *sure* about NZ?!      Edit: nope, not NZ.   Please, please fix the spelling    And, if you went along with the bonkers turn the show took, Season 5. Two cliffhangers - both mind-blowing.   Yep, I believe I recall all of those featured in the movie.

Especially with Avengers coming out very soon, which basically everyone will have ended up seeing.   Could anyone send me another link? Twitter is blocked where I am.   *Would you like a alcohol?*   Down to 85 now   Giacchino's *Lost* score is a masterpiece. I'd die happy if he came to score an MCU flick.   In the SchmoesKnow review, Kristian said he enjoyed it even more the second time and gave it a better rating than he did in this video.     Better the second time?! That's a good sign.   *I went to the stock market today. I did a business*   Kiwi here, it definitely isn't legal.   I'm the same - the concept of a larger film universe excites me, but the first film wasn't much more than a fun playful romp. The dramatic tone from the promos makes it look tense as *** - that's what I'm pumped for.   Maybe they didn't want to say what Vision does because it would be a spoiler whatever it was?   Mostly positive. Kristian gave it 4.2/5, Mark gave it 4.75/5.      Their main gripes are the strange "Russian" accents and apparently not much of a lead-up to Civil War.     Let's keep the hype train going!      r.i.p. op   WHERE IS HE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING?   It's been added to the dictionary too.   Um, this looks fucking awesome. Saved.   *a problem with Lost, not 'the' problem.    Pitch Perfect - not a musical. Music-centred comedy, but no breaking into song and dancing in public :)   AHH LUV U, PENNEH   TETSUOOOOOOOOOOO!   Same animators iirc   Lost. Despite anything you may say about how well it wrapped up, it's so goddamn complex. Characters show up in several people's flashbacks, sometimes super ambiguously. Locke v Ben, Locke v Jack, Jack v Christian etc. are great conflicts. Questions of right v wrong, power dynamics, vengeance, and the boundaries of redemption, are constantly brought up.     What starts off as a thriller about a plane crash becomes philosophical as hell.     Sure, the sci-fi/fantasy elements don't tie together well at the end, but 85+% of the show is spent developing and utilising its characters. Their story is tied up well. In those terms, the show is brilliant.          The real reason the show is talked down upon is because you can't debate or podcast as well about character as you can about the various mysteries - this aspect of the show was severely overhyped, and still is in terms of the show's overall "disappointment factor" in a sense. If that's all you focus on you're bound to be disappointed, but there's much more to this show than that.   But Sayid, Sun and Jin...   Introducing *The H8ful Eight*  	102

I am Oldish (33) And you were allotted 8 characters back in the online gaming infancy days. In the early/mid 90's Microsoft had a server called IGZ (Internet Gaming Zone) that would launch you into a networked DOS promt from a chat box and the players would (Ex: cd/duke3d setup.exe/f4) and enter the games setup menu.

The scenario I described does not happen that often at all. its an error on the side of the Customer(Store) and the distributor (Dudes who re-sent Package) Unfortunately human error is inevitable, this scenario is a double whammy, kinda like a unicorn but for frozen food.

When the distributor comes to reclaim the chest or tub they throw it back on the refrigerated trailer and it refreezes. The frozen food warehouse employee assumes it's a return (Because its frozen still) and puts it back into the big freezer and then unfortunately it gets sent out to some sad unsuspecting store assuming the product is fine.

[Here's one](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/dining/14curious.html?_r=0) that shed some light on as to why I like it now and didn't before. a slow introduction over time. and for some reason it doesn't even come close to reminding me of soap.

Has anyone else gone through this experience? You're at a 7-11 or Plaid Pantry, the line is like 2 people long, you calmly take your place at the end (Curving because the aisles interfere) and someone walks to the other side of the curve and stands there with their delicious treats. For me it's 3 minutes of "Am I going to have to make an awkward situation by saying something?" And then their is the Dick fuck Busy business guy who grabs a paper and walks to the front of the line and throws the money down and raises the paper, shakes it and says keep the penny and walks out while you do the normal person thing and wait your turn. Or how about the fat disability lady who spends 12 minutes buying lottery tickets while 12 people wait behind her blobenly welfare recipient ass, she has nowhere to be, WE ALL DO!

The athletes are suspected of carrying out a string of staggering crimes that kill innocent people and send the worlds economy into a tailspin.  Deep undercover, and with his life in imminent danger, Utah strives to prove they are the callous architects of these inconceivable crimes.  The film is replete with the most daring athleticism ever seen in a motion picture. These action adventure feats are performed by extreme athletes representing the worlds best in class in big-wave surfing, wingsuit flying, sheer-face snowboarding, free rock climbing, and high-speed motorcycling.                 Tommy Carcetti is a big guy.   Delta Farce was hilarious.      Could you check if interstellor is on the first page of every book ?? If not, burn em.   He is 26 actually.

 Aesthetic   Its rad. I picked up TWIABP's Whenever if ever, josh is dead, and deer leap split. Also Tigers Jaw self titled and Pity sex Feast of love. They have great stuff on the distro.   Yo I picked up whenever if ever too. Kinda dumb since i already have the latest tour press but still.   Im actually seeing pannucis pizza in may and have seen empire empire. I love both of them. Old gray is rad and i havent listend to salvia palth before.   I saw the Hotelier once when they were on tour with TWIABP. They were amazing but i never looked them up. Thank you   Morning Effort, things fall apart, and pannucis pizza are great. I love morning effort. Seeing pannucis pizza in may actually. I especially love their side project little tyrant.   Im actually just getting into elvis depressely. They're great. Ill check the other band out.   Really liking Not like igor. Thank for the links    For some reason i love the song Skeleton guy by a landslide.  Hey i suggest looking up Guest House- ill get over it i guess and Grammer - awesome knifes. Both are great   Yo The Family bed is pretty rad. I havent taken a lot of time to listen to them but they are great.   Sorry but i wanted to ask r/emo who they believe are the best new emo bands around. Personally im a huge fan of Free Throw, TWIABP, Tigers Jaw, Sorority Noise, and (even though not exactly emo) Teen suicide.  Also if anyone one has any suggestions if bands that i should look up thatd be appreciated. I just want to know who you all believe is leading the emo scene currently.   Yo i saw these guys twice at The Mr. Roboto project in Pittsburgh. They are amazing. I love their old stuff. Favorite song off the album next to lets get invisible.   Yea im all good   Free throw is rad. Cant wait to see them the 21st.    For a sec i thought this was going to be about the Mr. Roboto project in PA. Anyways, i love how parents will do this type of stuff to put a smile on their children's face.    You are a wonderful person. I wish you the best   Ill make sure to try to read it. Thank you very much for your words. It truly helps. Thank you.   I just need to get out of the house you know? Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day. thank you for believing me.   it's just been hard and shit lately. I just felt like you all deserved an update. thank you for your kind words. It has most definitely taught me something about myself.    Thank you, i will try!   I hope i can. Thank you so much.   It's hard cause when i think of the future it scares me. More years of living like this. More years of being alone. It stresses me out as well because i know ill always be insignificant, and that i have to do extremely well in school. I do not like to think about the future when its so hard to think about today.   I live around Pittsburgh. I much rather not exactly most the specific area but its around Pittsburgh.    Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2xzb2r/im_going_to_kill_myself_by_friday_i_hate_myself/  I guess ill introduce myself. My name is Tyler. I am 16 and have lived in Pennsylvania my whole life. I've been depressed since i was 8 and have tried to kill myself multiple times but have failed. A lot of you asked for my age so i guess i felt like i should tell you all. This whole post is going to be a mess. Im very tired and honestly not very stable so i apologize  Well it's Saturday and im posting this so as you can see i did not go through with it. I cried all last night and cried for a good hour this morning. I have a mixture of feelings about it. Anger, disappointment, frustration, sadness. I was too much of a coward to go through with it. I'm simply pathetic, but i just couldn't do it. No matter how much i want to die, no matter how much i hate myself, i just cant to it. I cant pain the one's i love by doing it. I want to die so much but i just don't have it in me to go through with it despite all my unsuccessful attempts in the past. I apologize for my post and worrying all of you. I cant say im doing better but i am alive. I did harm myself but it wasnt bad. I made a mistake by not killing myself but i guess that i should stick around. I may be suffering and extremely depressed but i guess i cant die yet. I'm so confused really. No matter how much i desire death i cant do it. I feel so empty right now, but hopefully things will get better.   I thank all of you for your comments and messages. You all gave me such wonderful advice and things i really needed to hear. I apologize if i did not reply to any of your PMs or comments, my mind and self was everywhere and i was so damn depressed that i couldnt bring myself to reply anymore. I felt ashamed of myself. You are all such great people and i thank you from the bottom of my heart for your reply and kind words.   I may not be able to ever be happy and may not be able to get myself out of this void. I feel horrible about who i am and have no self esteem. I do want to die but i guess i cant. It hurts that death isnt an option but there are people here that i must stay alive for. My depression has taken over but i can try to live with it. I have been for years, but it just sometimes gets so hard. Ive been depressed for half my life and it's hard to continue living this way. I care too much yet do not receive that care from the ones i love. I am resented due to me being clingy towards those people i hold close. Due to that i push them all away. Ive been alone for so long. I hate myself so fucking much. Im so very sorry for myself and my actions. Im sorry that i did not go through with it. Im sorry that i am pathetic. I thank you all for who you are and I appreciate all of your concern. Thank you.   Tonight i'll be doing something that i havent done in a while due to social anxiety. Im going out to a concert with my best friend. Thank you all   I cant say better but i can say alive.   Im okay   No one does but i cant count myself as human. A human can feel love and emotions. A human can sleep and go outside without wanting to jump in front of a car. I am not human. I am inferior to all you great people. You all are amazing. I do not deserve the love and support from all of you.   Ive been harming myself since i was 14 and ive survived by thinking if my family. I do not want to upset them and out them through pain. I have tried to commit suicide multiple times in the past but failed. I guess lately i just dont have the energy. I only get 2 hours of sleeo each night and eat once a day or every two days. I guess i survived because deep down i know that i don't want to die even though its my ultimate desire. I also cope with music and was hoping to become a musician. Life is difficult and i feel like death is a gift. Maybe dying is too good for me. I deserve go suffer.  	28
 If I Stay. Loved the book so much, even if it's YA. Stayed up half the night reading it and the other half reading the sequel. Movie was just... meh.  Also The Road.    No Country for Old Men   Assistant Manager. My S5 counts anywhere from 22000-28000. Fitbit Charge counts around 16000-20000. I think the S5 is a little generous with the step counts.  I work ten hours a day, half hour lunch.    My dad had a kid five years ago (dad is 48).  I've seen her probably 15 times since she was born and she's a really cool kid but since the age difference is so huge, she doesn't really feel like my sister. It's probably a little different than your situation because I'm not very close with my dad, him and my mom separated when I was 2 and from then on he was kind of a deadbeat. And she's a half sister.  However, once she gets older I can't wait to have a relationship with her as a sister. Take her to movies, lunch, things like that.  Kids are easy. Say "wow, really?!" a lot and act interested in what they have to say. They love it.   You could have a sit down with her, say "look, we're both busy, I know shit gets crazy sometimes but we both need to do our fair share of the cleaning. If you're going to have a cat, you need to clean up after it".  If she doesn't get it and reverts back to what she normally does, I would just hold out until August and hang out in your room. If she asks why, say you don't want to smell like pee. Maybe she'll get the hint.  I was in a situation like this with two roommates, and one didn't have a job. She just let the house get so disgusting to the point where my boyfriend and I moved out and never spoke to them again, despite being good friends for 5 years. It's hard to be friends with someone when you realize how gross they are.  Some people are slobs and always will be. Your roommate might be one of those people.   Pen refills. Especially when they come in with like a big ass bag of pens they got from like banks and stuff and want refills for every one. Kill me.  Dated also sucks. And telephones.    Yeah that's kind of where I'm at now. We made a meal earlier that we have made multiple times in the past and we usually finish it, and then have a snack later.  We didn't even get close to finishing it and we were both super full. He had a snack later, but I was good for hours afterward until dinner.   It is gross and really unnecessary. I've been reading the nutrition facts on stuff and lately he has too. A couple hours ago he was going to eat one of those Hersheys cookies and cream bars, read the nutrition facts and said "nope" and tossed it aside.   I'm sure if you continue to do things, they might rub off on her. Unless she has absolutely no desire to be healthy, then there might be a problem. If you really believe it's effecting your progress though you should definitely talk to her.    If it probably hasn't happened yet, it probably won't.  I'm actively trying to eat better -- no fast food, no chips, minimal soda, lots of water, no eating after 8 o'clock.   My boyfriend of ten years was kind of on board for the first few days and that's tapered off. But at night when he's having a bowl of cereal after dinner (yeah he does that too) and I'm quietly judging him while drinking a glass of water, he notices that "huh, maybe I'm not hungry" and won't finish it. Also if he's eating out of a bag of chips and sees me eating an apple, he'll just have a few instead of half the bag.  If you honestly think she has a problem with overeating, tell her. I've told my boyfriend that and vice versa. If there's open communication it shouldn't be an issue.   If you're just annoyed because she gets to have the bowl of cereal and you don't, you're probably gonna need to get over it. Sit next to her with a glass of water and some fruit and see what she does. If you see her slurping the milk, it's probably hopeless.   I had to do pretty much all the cycle counts for my entire store last year for inventory, having never did a cycle count before.   Paper was the worst. The confusing shit with the 10 of SKU 513099 is one SKU of 513096 and that business put me over the edge. Plus counting every... single... ream and every... single... pack of photo and specialty paper. It took me and one other person like all day.   So my boyfriend and I have had Blast! Plus for a couple years. I wanted cable so a year ago we added their super economy cable (30 channels or so, half are home shopping channels). They added that for free, and then it would be $30 or something a month after the year.   The year rolled around and we called them and said we didn't want the cable anymore, they said they would just give it to us for free. That was a couple weeks ago. And I just realized we have HBO on Demand and all of the HBO channels except for the HD ones.   They never mentioned this to us, it's nowhere on our bill. Did they fuck up, or with every service change do they throw in a trial of HBO?   If it's been a month I'll doubt you get a call. If they were actually looking for people you would have gotten a call or an email by now.   You'll get used to it.     	13
 She teleports Buffy, Dawn, and herself from Rack's place to the Magic Box after she's drained the magic battery (Rack) and was super-charged full of power.   From the script of "Two to Go":  As Willow speaks, the camera swirls around her in those Brian DePalma-y 360-degree arcs. But if we're really paying attention, we'd notice that the light and the background begin to change as she continues...  WILLOW You're trying to sell me on the world. The one where you lie to your friends when you're not trying to kill them and you screw a vampire just to feel and insane asylums are the comfy alternative. This world? Buffy, it's me! I know you were happier in the ground - hanging with the worms. The only time you were ever at peace in your whole life is when you were dead. (beat) Until Willow brought you back.  Willow stops. Buffy and Dawn look around. They are no longer standing in Rack's at all.  WILLOW (cont'd) You know - with Magick?  And now we see where they are, which is...  INT. MAGIC BOX - NIGHT  ... Inside the Magic Box, having gotten there without moving.  WILLOW Sorry. It can be kind of a rough trip if you're, you know - not me.  Buffy and Dawn stagger upon appearing in the Magic Box. Dawn tries to steady herself against a chair, but collapses to the floor, disoriented.   Sounds amazeballs.   Awesome. So, to make sure I'm understanding, is this an all-new establishment?   Hi fellow Tulsans.   I am interested in possibly gathering weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly (depending on interest) for creative writers and talk about writing in general, do some writing exercises, read each other's writing, bounce plot lines off one another, etc.  Writing, personally, is a lonely art and I often stop-and-start projects because it's always just me talkin to myself about my thoughts. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for a group of writers to come together, socialize, and celebrate our creativity.   If anyone's interested, or if you already know of similar groups, feel free to post below. If there's enough interest, we could go about setting up a location to meet, come up with topics or games, and go from there.   I mean, yes, they could've done that, but I think they saw that it wasn't working due to ratings. Still, to act like the Writer's Strike had *nothing* to do with it is just false.   I'm definitely down. Hope it is LGBT-friendly.   Any reason why I'm being downvoted?   Season 2 had so many missteps. Kring admitted the Hiro feudal Japan story wasn't great, as was the Wes/Claire relationship, and the odd time-warp between Peter and the woman he left in the future. However, the writer's strike ruined a lot of the pay off and forced them to cut the story lines and come up with a drastic, quick ending that ruined the future of the series. Personally, I enjoyed season 3 because we finally skirted the whole "we gotta hide" mentality and just went full-on "we're super-powered people."   I am amazed at how advanced the future generations are becoming. My nieces and nephews (only 8+ years older than me) see gender and sexuality incredibly fluid, and they're into "whomever connects with me mentally." That's an AWESOME mentality/development. I think somehow we're going to evolve into an asexual species, but those are my thoughts.  My point is that a lot of people, nowadays, are of the mind "I can sleep with whomever, whatever gender, as long as there's attraction." However, for many progressive-type people, attraction is broad. So when they meet someone who is only attracted to one gender, they somehow think it's being phobic when it's just hard-wired.  I'm glad the next generation seems to be totally accepting of bisexuality/pansexuality, but just because someone isn't bi or pansexual doesn't mean they're phobic of the opposite/same gender.   Sorry you had a bad experience. Some people get caught up in their own crap. Put on your boots and wade your way outta there.      Well, I grew up in a poor household and never could afford comics. So  I've not read any of the Marvel comics (I have a few collections of the Walking Dead comics). So, for someone who doesn't have any clue where to start, this would be a good investment? I know, it's "only a penny", but I guess I'm just wondering if it's worth the time and effort.   Watch Vampire Diaries and you'll get your soundtrack.   Is it worth it?   "Redd," her mother called from deep within the cottage, "don't forget your cloak. It's too cold to be running around without proper attire."  The little girl rolled her eyes before turning back and re-entering the house to put on the hood her grandmother made her. Without saying a word, she scrambled out into the wild wood just beyond the door of her house and started playing around in the fallen leaves of the forest. The bright oranges and reds and yellows glittered in the tree tops as the sun shined through the canopy. Redd loved fall.  Picking up a fallen tree limb, she used it as an imaginary sword used against her invisible enemy: Autolycus, King of Thieves. Having stolen his mother's wheat pie, made especially for her ill grandmother, Redd struck at the mischievous man to retrieve the item. After dueling countered blows, Redd finally stabbed the master thief in the hand, causing him to release the pie into the air with a jump. Redd twirled and thrust the sword behind her to impale the man in the stomach before catching the pie from hitting the ground.  Laughing, Redd dropped the stick and continued to the trickling of a nearby creek. It's cool waters slushed over the gray stones located in its bed as it traveled deeper into the forest. She reached down to grab a handful of water, seeing her reflection in the stream. After taking a big gulp, she looked back in the water to see her reflection again, only to find vicious red eyes looking over her shoulder. Turning, she saw a Hunde, an oversized werewolf with sharp, blood-stained fangs ready to pounce. In the distance, she heard her mother's screams.  "Redd."  The woman blinked a few times to see that the Hunde disappeared. She wasn't a little girl any longer, and it'd been close to twenty years since she last seen her mother. Feeling the sword in her hand and Alphonse's lead rope in the other, she forced herself to come back to reality. Close above her head, the fluttering blue jay, ironically named Robin, hovered as he waited for her response.  "Are you alright?" the bird asked.  Redd nodded. "The witch is stronger than I realized. She's enchanted this wood with intense illusionary magic."  "I tried to warn you," Robin said. "Are you capable of moving on?"  "Yes," Redd said as she shifted her body to wake itself from the haunting memory of her childhood. "Let's find this witch, so I can destroy her."  The blue jay said nothing else as he turned and continued his path toward the center of the forest, to the Gingerbread House where his friend, Gretel, and her brother, Hansel, remained prisoners.   Hey. No problem. Glad you enjoyed!  1) An athame is a ceremonial dagger. I re-read my prompt and realized I had a fantastic opportunity to explain that, but this was written in a hurry.  2) Turning - a conversion. In this world, Kimber and her family are magical people who receive their powers on their 18th birthday. Originally, the idea was to have their powers bestowed upon them after a horrific event on their 18th. For another prompt, it was simply a rite of passage along with a granted wish as a gift. This may still be kept in the later novelization (if I get that far).  3) As for Kimber's mother, it's still something I'm working out. Not that I don't have the reasoning, but I'm basing it off my family life. I'm trying to find a way to convert it into an intriguing plotline that makes sense. It's the driving force behind her mother's hunting of the family, to take their power on their 18th birthdays.  Thanks for the kind words. I've only written one other prompt based on this idea and I hope to pursue it further in other prompts, so I hope you don't get too deflated when you find hardly anything.  Right now, I'm calling it "The Unlucky Ones".  	15
    I personally was hoping for the "water in mouth, duckling bathing in mouth" technique, but hey, we don't live in a Disney universe            King Willem Alexander and Queen Maxima are on a trip to the United States, and i guess since EDM is our main source of export, it kinda fits our image.

 Read about Texas shelters elsewhere in this thread: that cat had zero chance there. It's precisely that the family did NOT try to find him a new home that angers some of us.    it's not their responsibility.   Yes, it is. Just like very other aspect of the deceased's life that is now theirs to sort out -- but more so, because this "heirloom" is alive and sentient. They had a responsibility to try harder to place the cat, at least in a foster home, before dumping it at a kill shelter.   They could ASK for advice before dumping. And that advice will always be the same: commit to finding him a new home, and in the meantime, let's work together to find him a foster home.  Adding, the events that cause people to dump cats are almost never as sudden as the dumpers make them out to be. They just chose to ignore signs and refused to make contingency plans, then plead necessity where little of that actually exists.   What would you have them do if they could no longer provide a good home?   Spend the time to recruit another family for him. It's doable; it just takes more time than people like this consider convenient. If they have to part ways with the cat immediately, they could place him in a foster home, then continue to work on finding a permanent placement. This goes on every day, where cat owners bother to think through their "sudden problem" and thus realize that others have  faced the same challenges before and found answers.     there are plenty of non-profits and charities in the Columbus metro area that could always use a few extra dollars.

My apology for this. I wasn't awake yet, and thought it was a different subreddit. I'll be more careful.   I think it's always a matter for public concern when an elected official has so little understanding of freedom of speech.  Also, this particular newspaper has historically banned reporters from using words as inoffensive as "vomit" -- the preferred usage as late as the early 2000s was "sick to one's stomach". So when things  in county government heat up like this, it's fun to see them struggle.       You're not "retarded" -- that's a completely offensive usage -- you're lazy.

Meanwhile: Mennonites are cool. There are many here, active in peace work.    This wasn't a political event, it's an annual music festival.   Well, actually it is a *very* political event, because [Community Festival is all about promoting progressive politics](http://www.comfest.com/purpose.php) including, prominently, gay rights. But it's a celebration of those politics, and the anti-gay jerk was only there at all because he has a constitutional right to speak and a habit of suing over that.    I wouldn't take my kid at that girl's age to either event  That's your choice, because it's your family.

Adding, people who love to hate ComFest keep circulating claims about degenerate activities happening there that nobody who works the entire fest every year has *ever* encountered. Remember, organizers have to answer to the CPD, the neighbors and the insurance company, so we log every single bad incident and discuss them all in a public meeting.   There are always a lot of rumors floating around, but the malicious lies are just ridiculous. If even 0.01% of them were true, the City would never let the festival happen. Instead, what happens is that police officers compete for a chance to work the fest, because *this is the safest event of its size in central Ohio*.

Both ComFest and the Columbus Free Press (in its earlier, saner incarnation) had deep roots in Tradewinds, whose female owners made all kinds of of street people, marginal characters, rebels and goofballs feel welcome. The demise of Tradewinds was considered by many area residents as the last straw in the University Partners takeover, the end of an era of independent shops along High near OSU. Students now can't begin to imagine what a  vibrant, creative scene existed there, and it's a damn shame.    Okay, the day of the week thing cinches it. The year not appearing on the leaflet itself is actually pretty common for the mid-70s. I still recall a fairly large demo for which the first print run failed to include any date at all -- it's hard now to imagine being so wrapped up in the moment and the issue that one could make such a mistake, but it happened a lot in the heat of the times.  Thanks for making the effort to sort out my confusion about this one.   Yes, I saw that -- but that's for a different leaflet, about a campaign that went on for many years. And it includes the kind of design and production that jibes with 1976, which is noticeably different from those in the OP's linked poster. YAWF always had a very recognizable graphic style, which became more sophisticated as they went along. The OP's link shows the later style with less text and larger graphics, but retains the use of Cooper Black typeface, so it can't be *very* far into the 80s, but I still think this is a later piece from the same campaign, not one from the first year of the campaign.  Of course, the simplest thing to do would be to ask the organization itself, which still exists as [The Party for Liberation and Socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_for_Socialism_and_Liberation) -- or better yet, ask some of the people involved at that time. Trying to figure things like this out without the participation of the people who were there at the time is just silly. This isn't really ancient history, and they're a great living resource.   How are you getting 1976 from this? The politics and design look more like early 80s.   Logistics are handled by people who hold leadership positions in the major operational sectors -- it's not a committee anybody can just walk in and join, but an executive committee that implements ideas developed by the whole group. That said, of course new ideas are welcome. All are welcome to attend general meetings, learn about the various committees and the overall planning process, and become part of the collective that makes policy by consensus.     Dates for General Planning Meetings are published in the Program Guide, and on ComFest.com      YES.

Peace Village is the large tented venue on the west side of Goodale Park, south of the Bike Corrral.    I'm sorry to seem rude, but I have to ask: if you know so little about the region and its people that you have to throw this very basic question out to a bunch of strangers, what makes you qualified to write for publication on this subject? Do you have any idea how many books are published every year on this subject by people with deep, longstanding ties to the subject? I'm guessing not, because you haven't cited any of them, including the ones that list the very info you seek here.  As an editor, I would turn down this pitch in a New York second. Unless this is headed for a vanity press (where the author pays the publisher), I don't see any book that starts out this way being publishable.   What a beautiful tribute to a beautiful cat!

You're rich!   It's on the linked Craigslist post.    Remember those insufficiently stringent campaign finance laws? They're stringent enough to make something like this a major headache. Better read up on reporting, limits, bundling, etc.  And best to let the campaign organization itself lead on fundraising, IMO. They don't need well-intentioned but under-informed supporters creating situations that have even the appearance of impropriety while they're trying to run the most principled presidential fundraising operation in history.

The FBI and DoJ distinction between homegrown and domestic terrorism is a political creation and should be ended. The homegrown classification locates Muslims as foreign agents operating in the U.S., not as part of the social fabric of this country. The portrayal of U.S. Muslims as potential or actual representatives of global jihad is used to justify the denial of constitutional protections and leads to representing ordinary menasking religious questions, criticizing the U.S. government, or even going camping with their friendsas a threat to society. It is past time to apply the same constitutional protections to everyone, and develop a response to terrorism based in analysis of patterns of violence instead of political costs and benefits.

Stop reaching so far for "reasons" and just plan something else for that weekend.   And of course *that* will never happen again.   (1) it was removed, which I as OP don't mind at all because   (2) that headline is actually from a completely different article -- the one I was trying to post when something went wrong and I didn't catch it until this morning, after the post had been removed.                Did you know Robert Lawson?  Yes. He was a sweetheart. He is missed.            less reported on since 9/11  That's because the working federal definition of terrorism was reworked twice since then, and for most of that time domestic terrorism was not so defined, nor an enforcement priority. Events have required a course correction, and it now is recognized for what it always has been.      Where do you draw the line? If you don't speak up about planned crimes against property, do you also stay silent in the face of planned  crimes against persons?    If it's a permit area, residents can call to have those cars towed. If it's not a permit area, why haven't residents tried to get that designation?   In any case, vandalism against cars legally parked on a public street is not the answer. I hope you pushed back when told about this plan.   You're welcome to try that notion out on the Joint Terrorism Task Force, which does regard this type of crime as terrorism.    This was a lone wolf type of crime, not a group or movement  "Lone wolf" crimes committed by white supremacists absolutely are part of a movement. This tactic was popularized by KKK leader Louis Beam in the 1980s as an extension of the "leaderless resistance" strategy proposed in the 1960s by Col. Ulius Louis Amoss to fight the alleged communist takeover of the US. In recent years the term has been extended almost beyond meaning by sloppy use in the popular press. But it is understood both by its adherents and by anti-terrorism LEOs as meaning exactly what it always meant: a paper-thin veneer of "plausible deniability" meant to conceal the existence of a white supremacist movement waging war on democratic rights.  Thre is a ton of material available online about this, but [here's a primer](http://www.publiceye.org/liberty/terrorism/insurgency/leaderless-resistance.html).   Some things to keep in mind: there are multiple agencies involved in policing this event, not all of which are willing to meet with organizers in advance, not all of which have the same priorities about what to police. Big props are due to the CPD, who overall do a great job. Last year, there was miscommunication about how to close in the middle of a downpour, complicated by a rumor (untrue) that an officer had been attacked. That won't happen again.  Also, remember that most of these citations and arrests are for really egregious violations of state laws, and many are for illegal drinking. On the numbers *and* in the view of police, ComFest is consistently one of the safest major public events in Columbus.   Those who are seriously concerned about policing should come to the Solar Stage at 4:55 PM Saturday for a workshop on police accountability, featuring organizers of the campaign for a civilian review board along with several attorneys who have spent decades representing victims of police misconduct -- and a retired CPD officer with long experience at ComFest.   You clearly have no idea how much money and hard work the festival organization does in Goodale Park -- planting trees, flowers and grass; upgrading the electric grid; helping to pay for bike stands and the fountain, etc. The park wouldn't be half as nice if ComFest hadn't spent the last 34 years working on it. Ask Friends Of Goodale Park if they want it gone. Ask any of the business groups in the area if they want it gone.   Every year, the festival organizers have to get local residents to sign off on the permit -- and what that shows is that your opinion is in the tiny minority of whiners; most local residents love the fest.    If you didn't want to live in the prime entertainment district of a boomtown, why did you move there?

I don't know the guy -- I just know that when your entire staff walks out in one day, they're not the problem.   Nor you.   No, every newspaper gets that sort of complaints from readers. Most major dailies don't answer such crank complaints in front of the whole readership, under the editor's name, on the front page of the second section, week after week after week. This column has been an embarrassment for the Dispatch for years -- it makes the paper sound like a small town weekly, and shows Marrison as unbelievably thin-skinned.  The new editor, Alan Miller, may not continue this tradition, but brings other baggage. He's  a careerist, and so insecure that he once used his position as head of the Ohio Legislative Correspondents Association to ban reporters from alternative weeklies  -- who had been eating the Dispatch's lunch at professional awards ceremonies -- from the Statehouse press room.  We're farther than ever from having the paper Columbus needs.    You're kidding, right? The biggest offsite viewing area for RWB is Goodale Park, and every year the crowds leave literally tons of trash when they depart. If you never noticed that, it's because for many years ComFest volunteers did the cleanup for that, too.     Before you take the word of the single most negative troll in this subreddit, do yourself a favor and read about Community Festival.   This is the fest that has won so many awards for "best festival in central Ohio" that the paid staff of other fests joke about giving ComFest an all-time award and taking it out of contention just to give others a chance. It's the fest that annually motivates 1,700 volunteers to work for free running six stages with over 250 performances and workshops. It's the organization that gives thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of labor to keep Goodale Park green and blooming, and leaves the park pristine when the fest is over (unlike virtually every other festival in town). These are the folks who take nothing for themselves but give back profits from the event as grants to dozens of community organizations.   You can read what the organization does,and why, at [the ComFest website](http://comfest.com), and find plenty of praise for the event just by searching for past news coverage. But the best way to learn how wrong the OP is would be to just come on down to this free event next weekend. You can find all the details about transportation, hours, performances, etc in the [2015 Community Festival Program Guide](http://www.comfest.com/program-guide.php), and read about the fest's history in the [40th anniversary commemorative book published in 2012](http://athensmessenger.com/app/emag/ComfestXL/ComfestXL.swf).  EDIT: removed true but tangential statement about OP in order to keep the focus where it belongs.    I equally hate Red, White and Boom  We'll be waiting for your preview hate post on that one.   I have no idea why you think this article was written by me. Considering that I found it on your Twitter account, I would think you knew better.

Dos he have a name yet?      There's one red flag that should have stopped anybody who looked at the website in their tracks: No Board of Directors is listed. This is the fastest shortcut to figuring out who's behind a new organization, and  in this case it just isn't there.  This group is doing most of their outreach through Facebook, where they ask for signatures on on after another "petition", "birthday card" or "thank you message". Given all the evidence, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that this is primarily a list-building operation, not an activist group.        I experienced a good illustration of how powerful muscle memory can be when I went to the Post Office recently to pick up mail from a box that I use only once a year (other folks in the same org use it the rest of the time): I didn't have the box number with me, so I just stood approximately where I remembered standing last year and *automatically* put the key into the right lock on the first try. I only thought to try that because I'd just seen some TV rerun in which a person who couldn't remember his name was handed a pen and paper and asked to sign his name.   Muscle memory is real, and powerful, and weird.    What is your problem?   Say what?

I'm tired of reddit being not much more than circlejerks, memes, and advertising.   It isn't that, if you choose your subscriptions carefully and avoid most of the defaults -- especially /r/all. If you do it right, reading your own front page plus your "friends" page can be amazing and not at all annoying.   Yes, that was 2010. The link I gave is *five years later* -- five critical growth years for Columbus. But even if there had been no change, 5.6% is not insignificant. The Dispatch thought this was an audience segment worth catering to; the fact that they did it so badly as to be unsustainable doesn't undercut the segment's growing importance.    I love the fact that sane redditors don't know about the "huge storm" raging in /r/all and some default reddits. This is about the admins' decision to ban subreddits like /r/FatPeopleHate whose subscribers had been taking their hate outside their home cesspool and going around to brigade other reddits. Since it's June, and millions of  teenage redditors have nothing better to do, they decided this was an unconscionable betrayal of reddit's supposed function as a free speech forum, and issued a call to arms against the admins. When nobody answered, they announced a mass exodus to voat.   The only people who noticed were clickbait parasites like DailyDot and the British tabloids, who don't even know how the site works. It's been a bit more hilarious than the usual June reddit freakout.   It's not a meetup, but if he wants to meet more paramedics he might want to spend part of the weekend of June 26-28 volunteering for First Aid at Community Festival.  For volunteers, they need people with current certification in 1st Aid and CPR, or who have equivalent or superior certification  /or training  /or professional experience.   It's a great way to meet people. The main First Aid station is located in the center of the park, so he'd get to talk to all sorts of people passing by, not just the sick ones. Every shift includes Fire/EMS workers, so that's another bunch of folks to meet. And when he gets off his 4-hour shift, he's already in the middle of the city's best party!

Every single one of those incidents put SAR rangers in danger, and everybody involved -- at all the parks -- is grateful for anything that might reduce this unnecessary risk. If you've never read it, [this book](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/ranger-confidential-andrea-lankford/1110833684?ean=9780762752638) can help understand what it's like to be on the other side of dealing with this "statistically insignificant minority" of hikers.    If you can't score a permit for the main corridor campgrounds you could also try to get a permit for one of the other camping areas on other less popular trails that head down into the canyon.  This is not a good idea for any first-timer, let alone one who hasn't managed to locate the basic info about the Canyon. You correctly hiked the corridor trails, which should be the first step for any hiker.  Also, a lot has changed since 2008, including very prominently the demand for permits and the system for getting them. The increase in visitors is qualitative, with people showing up by the dozens or even hundreds to hike or run the corridor. There is so much demand now that there is serious consideration being given to instituting fees for every hiker who steps below the rim, whether they camp overnight or not.   The answer to this is not for first-timers to try even the easiest of the lesser-known, less populated trails.    Nope. This particular group is so inept that their "secret" backing was exposed long before I encountered them.    I think I speak for many here when I say, "Wait -- Columbus has a *flag?*"    Just don't go getting involved with the GoTopless group -- they're a front for the [Raelian UFO cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C3%ABlism).    Yes, you need a permit, and no, you don't have much chance of getting one at this point. Permits for October (a prime weather time) are already gone, having been grabbed up a month ago. There is a slight possibility that you could catch a cancellation, but you're going to be doing the corridor, and those are the most popular sites, so it's a very, very slight chance.  I'd offer more hope, but frankly it doesn't sound like you've done much thinking or research about this. How hard can it be to read the official website for the park, where all this is laid out in user-friendly fashion? I'm sorry to sound harsh, but what you're talking about is not a stroll in the park.

Yep: they're the problem, and the proof that no amount of signage or literature *at the site* makes much of a difference. They're why NPS initiated a whole new job category: *Preventive* Search and Rescue. These are the folks who stand at the trailhead and try to convince unprepared hikers to rethink. But even they have only limited success, and they don't have the legal ability to stop anybody, even the most unprepared. All they can do is try to talk these folks out of going ahead, thanks to some jerk who litigated for the right to be stupid. That's why I'm always happy to see any article that might cut down, even slightly, on the number of preventable tragedies.     Okay, that explains it. I've never used AdBlock. I just got in the habit of ignoring ads 20 years ago, so never saw the need for it.   Thanks for the reply. I thought you were saying the article was unnecessary. I'm happy to be wrong about that.    Can we see a picture of Patches?   Er, Charlie is a female ....?   Your premise is deeply flawed, so it's really not possible to answer. Some people don't like jazz, just as some people don't like rock or hiphop or classical music. But there's no evidence of any large number of people who *hate* jazz. The account you linked to seems designed to troll, for what reason nobody knows. In any case, that's one person,not a trend.    Nobody is experienced at this without first being one of the inexperienced nitwits.   Not every first timer is a nitwit. Some take the time to read about what they plan to do, and ask those more experienced. Just because this mass audience article doesn't speak to you doesn't mean that it won't speak to others who would otherwise have continued as nitwits.  After 20 years hiking GCNP, I'm always glad to see this kind of preventive outreach, no matter how clumsy the style. *Any* such effort beats having to intercept unprepared hikers at the trailhead to try to convince them not to go ahead on a hike that *will* result in having to send SAR after them later.

If you're going to be concerned about human trafficking, it's a good idea to double check any stats you read. The overwhelming majority of humans trafficked are *not* sex workers but agricultural, industrial or domestic workers. The reason you see so much about sex trafficking (which is a real but much smaller problem) is because the loudest voices on this are evangelical Christian groups that frame the issue in ways that serve their mission. Some of these evangelical groups write about the issue in a way that intentionally blurs a reader's understanding of which numbers are for all trafficking and which are for sex trafficking  Most NGOs working on the issue of human trafficking reject the model used by these groups, which focus on "rescue" of individuals (almost always women) rather than focusing on changing the economic inequality that forces people into sexual [or other] slavery.   So please take this *whole* issue as seriously as it deserves, and be sure to read the critiques of those who were working on the big picture before American evangelicals saw their opportunity to use this one aspect to raise money and recruit well-intentioned suburban teenagers.

THIS ISN'T EVEN MY FINAL FORM.   Bee buhbe beep bee bubebeep   Goin' on a year now I ain't had nothin' twixt my nethers weren't run on batteries   The old Pyrex containers that were indestructible.   Jar Jar. Er, wait...   Recently switched to black socks. Not going back.   With prayer and yelling and some weird hybrid.   Gay Marriage.   That's really hard to say 5 times fast.   Twitter has been useful in the academic community and also as a form of live journalism i.e. the Arab Spring.   Lesbian sex. Am male.   Condoms.   A car.   Well, best of luck!   To add to other comments here, I kinda doubt you have a good enough grasp of linguistics to come up with good research questions. Coming up with good modern research ideas is really hard, especially without feedback from peers or advisors, not to mention your inexperience in methods and in the writing expectations of your discipline. I mean, I don't know what it is, but often I'll come up with an idea that sounds great to me, come back to it in a few months, and then either think it's not that great anymore or find out someone else already came up with the same idea years ago. tl;dr I kinda doubt you know enough to know what you don't know, and more to the point, what the field doesn't know.   I think it's a perfectly fine hypothesis to test, but as far as I can tell the tests of its predictions have been mostly negative.  Agreed.  I'm glad someone's doing the experiments, even if the results are negative, negative results are still good science. My intuition is that the explanation is not really genetic or adaptive, and that we need a better understanding of the developmental biology, neurobiology, and sociocultural aspects of sexuality. So I agree that those researchers are probably going down the wrong path to understanding the biology of homosexuality.  Fun Fact: Apparently 23andMe did a GWAS of sexual identity on over 20,000 individuals and didn't find any associated SNPs.   Did the drug switch help?   They're both western homages to the magical girl anime genre, e.g. Sailor Moon, Revolutionary Girl Utena. It's funny because Steven is basically, boy as magical girl but with all the character traits you'd expect like innocence, naivette, and a heart of gold, while Bee is basically, 20 something slacker temp worker adult as magical girl subverting the common magical girl character traits. Also, both Natasha Allegri and Rebecca Sugar worked on Adventure Time. It's basically two different versions of Magical Girl Adventure Time.   Goodnight has some interesting work in spiders also. I think I hold the same opinion as most kin selectionists: group selection, in it's current form, is theoretically sound, but has not been as useful in practice except in a few isolated examples, but I admit that it is also because partly due to sociocultural and historical reasons. I also think we're getting too far from the topic at hand.   I've read Nowak et al., the responses, the counter-responses, and most of the other commentaries on the subject. I agree that everyone agrees group selection is theoretically sound, even if they disagree on whether it is a useful perspective in practice or not. Pruitt and Goodnight have some fascinating empirical work on group selection.   Group selection is theoretically sound, this is recognized by people in the field, even if they don't agree on it's practical advantages.   you spelled rape wrong.   God damn it Carl.   The tape?   I... I do it every month.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzDAVZeY7BA   Let me guess, your brother saved the world from bug aliens and now you're the leader of the world.   Here are quotes from the first page results in google scholar for "homosexuality evolution kin selection" for All Time and Since 2011 (minus a few that I could not access or find "kin selection" in except in the references): Edit: Emphasis mine.  Barthes et al. 2013: "This **kin selection hypothesis has received little empirical support in Western societies and is still debated** (Bobrow   Bailey, 2001; Rahman   Hull, 2005; Vasey   VanderLaan, 2010)."  VanderLaan et al. 2015: "**Homosexual males who were feminine as children experienced elevated childhood concern for kin. [...] Future research should also examine whether kin-directed altruism helps offset fitness costs of same-sex sexual orientation**."  Vasey and VanderLaan et al. 2013: "**Overall, these tests indicate that the female kin of male androphiles produce more offspring than those of male gynephiles**."  Burri et al. 2015: "Theoretical and mathematical models have proposed two broad variants of balancing selection as putative compensatory mechanisms for human homosexuality: heterozygote advantage and sexually antagonistic selection. [...] Other behavioral data, e.g., on social preferences, which are relevant to **alternative evolutionary models for the maintenance of homosexuality (such as kin selection**, whereby gay relatives enhance the survival of their siblings offspring through caregiving or resource provision), **are also only available for men**."  Pfaus et al. 2012: "One such benefit could be related to kin selection (e.g., Wilson, 1975), as in the gay uncle hypothesis that **has received much attention but little empirical support in Westernculture (Bobrow   Bailey, 2001), although it appears to be supported among the Samoan** faafafine (Vasey   VanderLaan, 2010)"  Forrester, VanderLaan et al. Vasey 2011: "Consistent with the KSH and findings from Samoa, androphilic men exhibited a significantly greater cognitive dissociation between altruistic tendencies directed toward kin versus non-kin children relative to gynephilic men and androphilic women. **The present study, therefore, provides some tentative support for the KSH from a culture other than Samoa. Findings and future directions for research are considered within the context of the existing cross-cultural literature**."  Ablid et al. Vasey 2013: "**Support for this hypothesis has been garnered from studies conducted in Samoa, but not from studies of gay men in industrialized cultures** (i.e., Canada, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States). This cross-cultural difference may be due to relatively greater geographic and familial disconnect experienced by androphilic gay men in industrialized cultures. This article reasons that in more industrialized settings, friends children may serve as non-adaptive proxies for nieces and nephews. Hence, it was predicted that Canadian androphilic men would exhibit elevated altruistic tendencies toward their friends children compared with gynephilic men and androphilic women. **This prediction was not supported**."  Bobrow and Bailey 2011: "We tested the kin selection hypothesis of male homosexuality using questionnaire data in a community sample of homosexual and heterosexual men. **Homosexual men were no more likely than heterosexual men to channel resources toward family members**. Indeed, heterosexual men tended to give more financial resources to siblings than homosexual men. Furthermore, homosexual men were somewhat more estranged from family members, especially from fathers and oldest siblings."  Rahman et al. 2005: "The current investigation, following Bobrow and Bailey (2001), aimed to test the kin selection theory of homosexuality in human males using a survey design. A total of 60 heterosexual and 60 homosexual men from England [...] **Overall, little support was found for the kin selection theory in a community sample**."  and Rahman et al. 2005 Erratum: "It is worth noting that while the percentages in Tables 1, 2 appear to show a difference between heterosexual and homosexual men in the homosexual paternal line male relatives and homosexual paternal line female relatives (where homosexual men are not hypothesized to have more homosexual relatives), **the difference between the two groups is not actually statistically significant.**"  Camperio-Ciani et al. 2004: "Wilson (1975), attempting to solve the paradox, suggested a possible role for homosexuals as helpers in their families, increasing the fitnesses of their relatives and, thus, balancing their reduced direct fitness. However, both Muscarella (2000) and Bobrow   Bailey (2001) in recent empirical studies, showed that **homosexuals do not act as helpers and do not give more financial or emotional resources to siblings than do heterosexual men**. Other studies by R . Trivers (personnal communication), Rice (1998) and Miller (2000) have suggested the partial penetrance of a candidate homosexual genetic factor and hypothesized that pleiotropic or sexually antagonistic effects, acting on personality, increase fecundity in non-homosexual carriers, thereby balancing the reduction in homosexual fecundity (Miller 2000). No supportive evidence or empirical data, however, has yet been shown."  Vasey et al. 2007: "Although the greater avuncular tendencies of fa'afafine support the basic prediction of the Kin Selection Hypothesis for male androphilia, **further research is needed before one can conclude that these elevated tendencies represent a specially designed adaptation for promoting the fitness of kin**. We discuss a number of sociocultural factors that might promote the expression of avuncular tendencies by androphilic males in Independent Samoa."  Kirkpatric 2000: "Three adaptationist hypotheses are reviewed here and compared with the anthropological literature. There is little evidence that lineages gain reproductive advantage through offspring care provided by homosexual members. Therefore, **there is little support for the hypothesis that homosexuality evolved by kin selection**. Parents at times control childrens reproductive decisions and at times encourage children in homosexual behavior. There is therefore more support for the hypothesis of parental manipulation. Support is strongest, however, for the hypothesis that homosexual behavior comes from individual selection for reciprocal altruism."  Camperio-Ciani et al. 2008: "**Kin selection was earlier invoked [13], [16], [17], and later refuted [18], [19]**. Other suggestions followed, the more recent debate being broadly focused on three lines of argument, not all based on genetic factors: overdominance (i.e. male heterozygous advantage, [7], [20][22]), maternal effects on male offspring (such as maternal selection [23], or maternal genomic imprinting [9]), and sexually antagonistic selection [2], [13], [15], [24][27]."  So, it seems to me that the general consensus is that kin selection (in the context of homosexuality) is not well supported cross-cullturally, though there are supporters of kin selection, mainly the cluster within the discipline who work with the Samoan population. In other cultures, the evidence is negative or inconclusive. There is yet no quantitative test of the form of Hamilton's rule. Alternative evolutionary hypotheses, such as heterozygous advantage and sexually antagonistic selection, seem better supported than kin selection, although the jury is still out.  I would like to thank you though, the above exercise has been illuminating. If you have a rebuttal, I would be glad to hear it.    strawman fallacy and appealing to authority to back up your claims by attacking the two articles I happened to post.  How is this a strawman fallacy or appealing to authority? The two articles you posted in support of your claim do not support you claim. Who's authority am I appealing to? I didn't mention anyone's name. All I did was quote written passages from the two articles you posted. I also find this ironic coming from someone who earlier tried to legitimize their comments by appealing to authority; to quote, "I teach behavioral ecology at one of the top universities in the world."   On the topic of logical fallacies, refuting a claim is not evidence for an alternative, agreed?  Yes, I never said otherwise.   I provide evidence for my argument, but you provide nothing to support yours.  My argument was merely that the evidence you provided to support your argument does not actually support your argument. My evidence is to quote passages in both articles you supported which contradict your claim. I never attacked the two articles you posted, I quoted passages from their own text. Moreover, I clearly said that I was not supporting an alternative explanation.   How about you provide some citations that rule out Hamiltonian models in favor of the several broad categories you offer?  I point you back to the same two papers you sourced.   Offer something other than rudeness.  Where was I being rude? I said I'd be happy to read any papers you had that actually support the kin selection hypothesis for homosexuality.   In what way is my analogy bad?  Because it is clear that the OP has some serious fundamental misconceptions about evolutionary theory, and your answer to their question was not even to explain kin selection in the context of homosexuality, but explain how it applies in a completely different context, and somehow expect the OP to draw a proper inference from the analogy, without the proper conceptual framework (i.e. kin selection) in which to properly map from one situation (eusocial insects and reproductive skew) to the other (human homosexuality).  Edit:  What hasn't been tested? I'm unclear on what you're referring to.  I was referring to the group selection model the author proposed as an alternative to the four other evolutionary theories (including kin selection) the author reviewed. It was a minor point, so I didn't mention it above.   Haa seriously. All the low hanging fruit has been taken. I think the best place for new ideas is to think about what questions can now be asked with the most recent technological or methodological advances in your field. E.g. genome sequencing, opened up whole new ideas to research and new ways of looking at old ideas.    Thanks, very interesting!   Another way to think about it is to think about what kind of behavioral algorithms the bee might be using when it's trying to build combs. You lay out one circular comb, then the next best place to build a comb is tangential to the first comb you built, then you want to move just far enough from both combs to build another comb tangential to *both* of the combs you just built. The hexagonal packing of circles then is a natural consequence, even if the bee has no concept of the overall design, it's only acting based on asking: is this too close to the combs I can see around me, or is too far, or is it just right. But to build a square packing, the bee would have to have a concept of right angles from each other. The first one is intuitively more "natural" and is a much simpler and robust behavioral rule. The rule is just, move so that I am some fixed distance away from every cell that I can see around me, and build here.  I don't know of if this is actually what happens, but that's my hypothesis.   Yup, see my other post, that's exactly what happens.   So the thing is, they actually start out as circles, which get pulled into hexagonal shapes. Circles pack in the same way that hexagons tesselate the plane, but not squares or triangles. So to get a square tessellation from packed circles, the bees would have to pack circles in a square lattice, and then those circles would be pulled into square shapes, but such a packing is not ideal. Hexagons are a "natural" shape for packing things in a plane.  http://www.nature.com/news/how-honeycombs-can-build-themselves-1.13398   Because combs when built are actual packed circles, but due to surface tension at the joints, get pulled into hexagonal shapes. If you pack a bunch of circles, the centers don't line up with the centers of square or triangles when tessellated.  http://www.nature.com/news/how-honeycombs-can-build-themselves-1.13398    In order for this to work, every single baby step has to be beneficial to the species.  No, "benefit to the species" is never the evolutionary reason.   It's still a bad analogy with respect to the question that was asked and the level of misconception about evolution shown by the OP. It's a bad analogy, and a bad explanation of kin selection to someone who doesn't know kin selection, without any guidance on how the analogy is supposed to be interpreted in the context of human sexuality.  Ironically, the first article you posted says: "At the present time, there is no quantified statistics on the reproductive benefits of having a homosexual relative. Ultimately, kin selection seems a lot more evolutionarily plausible for female worker ants and bees (with their genetic peculiarity of being more closely related to the queens offspring than to any offspring of their own) than it does for homosexual human beings." To summarize, it reviews current evolutionary theories for homosexuality, and argues against the first four of five, while proposing a *potential* model of *group* selection, which while interesting, has not (to my knowledge) been tested.  And the second article says: "Previous research conducted in Western countries (U.S., UK) has failed to find any support for this hypothesis. In contrast, research conducted in Samoa has provided repeated support for it. In light of these cross-cultural differences, we hypothesized that the development of elevated avuncular (i.e., altruistic uncle-like) tendencies in androphilic males may be contingent on a relatively collectivistic cultural context. [...] The results of this study furnished no evidence that androphilic Japanese men exhibited elevated avuncular tendencies compared to their gynephilic counterparts." though there is evidence in Samoan and Polynesian cultures.  So neither paper you've cited supports your claim. I'm not saying there isn't evidence for a Hamiltonian hypothesis, but it isn't strong, and there are a number of competing evolutionary, sociocultural, and neurological/developmental models, among which there is not strong consensus around any single explanation. Though if you had better papers than the ones you listed, I'd be happy to read them. I have googled it in the past, and as far as I can tell, there's no consensus.   They don't, IIRC from a competitive food eating book I read years ago. One said the only time she ever puked was due to food poisoning.   Better than mouth stuck in penis.   No, that's a terrible analogy, and there just isn't that strong of evidence for a kin selection explanation for homosexuality.    There are probably many more homosexuals in the world today than say 200 years ago.  Well yeah, there are more people period than there were 200 years ago. Also, it's far more acceptable to be gay today than 200 years ago, so more people are out.  Nature doesn't "control" things, nature has no mind of it's own. There's no universal consciousness that thinks "oh, there are lots of people, we should make them less reproductive by making them gay."  Not to mention, there are a thousand other ways to reduce population growth, including contraceptives, sexed, empowering women, development.   There are a lot of misconceptions about evolution here. First, homosexuality did not evolve as a means to curb population. Trait's don't evolve because they help the species, traits only evolve because they help individuals compete against other individuals for reproductive success. There's no such thing as evolution acting "for the good of the species", because nature has no conscience or end goal.  The second main misconception is that all traits evolve because they are beneficial. This leads people to seek adaptive explanations for traits that aren't adaptive. Just because homosexuality exists in humans (and other species) does not mean it's advantageous (nor does it mean it's disadvantageous) for the individual/gene.  But let's assume homosexuality is evolutionarily beneficial, for whatever reason. Evolution is not a moral theory, it simply describes what happens in nature, it does not prescribe what *should* happen. Nature does not think nor does it plan, and so it has nothing to say about morality or ethics. Thus, evolution says nothing about how gay people *should* or *ought* to behave, and thus, it says nothing about how you should form an opinion about what *other* people *should* or *ought* to behave. I'll give you an analogy: Gravity describes how planets move and objects fall, it doesn't say that objects *should* fall and it doesn't say we shouldn't flying in planes because planes cause a lot of pollution. It simply describes the motion of objects, just as evolution describes the "motion" of genes through time.  Oh, and over-population has not been a problem for humankind until recently. But that's a minor quibble.   *, ELLEN?*   Only if we go extinct.   I haven't read it and only casually have followed the debates, but try "Evolution - The Extended Synthesis" by Pigliucci and Mueller. It presents the argument that the Modern Synthesis needs to be extended, which has its proponents and critics. Also check out the article "Does evolutionary theory need a rethink?" for a comment from the proponent side and a counter-comment from the critic side, since you should read about both perspectives.   ...I don't understand your question then.    Do you guys think it would be O.K if I submitted it to another journal and simply withheld the news until I got a response from that journal?  No that is *not* okay, since he's a co-author, he not only should be informed about the state of the paper out of courtesy, but also out of the fact that his name is on the paper. It's not like he's not going to find out, and why would you think it's better if he found out indirectly months from now? That's a terrible idea.  It's a rejection, so what, rejection is the norm not the exception. Your supervisor (presumably is) empathetic, and (presumably) wants to help you. He's been there probably countless times before.  The other thing to think is why wouldn't you make your paper better by incorporating the editor's feedback. Though this paper did not go to review, for papers that do and get rejected, a lot of the time if you send them to another journal, you'll get some of the same reviewers just because your field is small (yes?). Reviewers aren't gonna like to see the same paper again without any attempt at incorporating their previous feedback.   I mean, there are a lot of people who can't swim...   Or worse. *Much worse*.   Not what I meant.   Still, of the two competing hypotheses...   Oppreshuns.   I am aware that studies (and personal experience) have shown rational argumentation doesn't work. That doesn't say anything about the efficacy of ridicule, which is why I'm asking for a source.    Mild ridicule can actually go a long way towards changing somebody's mind.  Citation for a study supporting this claim?   I forgot which blogger said it, but Rose's absence is *the* hole around which the entire story is structure around.   If it looks like an animation error, it's probably an animation error.   Not to mention, it's pretty obvious when centipeedle reformed, the silohuette had only one body. It's like people can't properly weigh evidence.   Sometimes, there are clouds blocking the view.   Well, because there's no 41st of January or 71st (72nd rounded) of February. Rand wouldn't work as a celebrated date either. But there *is* a 14th of March, and also a 28th of June.   If only!   You know how when bodies of water are very still at night and you can see stars at the bottom of them? We use telescopes positioned downward to study those stars.   They do have a great national lab though, Oak Ridge.   Basically, when we partition human genetic variance (using AMOVA) into the part which is explained by within population effects versus the part which is explained by between population effects, almost all human genetic variance is explained by within population effects.   Fermat's *little* theorem. Not his last one.   Read that as "My wife mushes it up and feeds her just like she fed me when she was a baby." And was really confused.   No, just Transcendent.   High school counselors.   Fantastic Planet. Where humans are pests among giant blue aliens.   My dad.   Could someone explain what I'm supposed to be seeing?   ...In the 25%?   ...Wait, how does that improve the dependency ratio? The biggest driver of the dependency ratio are the baby boomers entering retirement. And then the problem will only get worse, since you have a huge absent 14 years of cohorts who won't enter the workforce.   Natural selection does not mean that drift does not occur at the selective locus; the gene frequency dynamics at the locus are the result of both deterministic (natural selection) and stochastic (drift) components. That is not to say the other guy/girl's logic makes any sense though...   Wait what? That made literally no sense. Neutral genes does not imply genetic drift, and genes under selection does not exclude genetic drift acting *on the selective locus*.   I don't understand your answer to your own question. There's no mention of fitness differences *correlated with genotype* on which selection can act, and there's also no mention of genetics or populations or frequencies which is what genetic drift describes, so it's neither a question about selection nor genetic drift. It's a terribly worded question. At best, it's a description of a fitness difference, but without describing some kind of covariance with some kind of inheritable character, it's not a description of natural selection.      No.   Yes, but for fun, let's propose some alternative hypotheses.  1) Rose has more defined hair in the first scene than the other two is because they wanted to make her look younger in the later scenes.  2) In the top right shot, this is during a motion frame, while all the others are during (near) static frames. Motion frames tend to have less details.  3) There are some differences in lighting, and also in distance to the camera.   It... looks like the logo to No Man's Sky   Aww thanks. I'm actually 5 years old tho. Still in kindergarten!   There Will Be Blood Everywhere.   ANDDDD I was thinking of There Will Be Blood again. Why do I always always conbooddle the two.   Iroh embracing Zuko in Sozin's Comet in Avatar the Last Airbender. From the same series, "In memory of Mako".   It's kinda a chicken or egg situation. If you grow up lacking access to healthier foods, your food preferences, habits, cooking skills, and food and health education will be determined by what food is available in your community. This makes it impossible for healthier alternatives to establish themselves in these same communities.   They become migrant workers.   Following up on the circumcision question: How does that work? How long after birth? Who performs it? Is there cake and merriment involved?   tl;dr Poor people are more likely to live in food deserts.   To add a little to my own answer, there are a few other reasons of historical contingency which at least made our lineage more likely to evolve towards such high intelligence; we're primates, which have a fairly high brain to body size ratio among mammals already, most of whom are social and arboreal (both behaviors requiring bigger brains), who are already good at manipulating the environment (we have pretty awesome forearms), and who felt the pressure of climate change in African savannah around 5-7 million years ago which pushed us towards bipedalism and endurance running, and we are one of but many evolutionary trials of hominid species, ranging from robust primarily plant eating species to gracile omnivores, and we happen to be the ones that survived, despite at some point numbering less than a 100k. The traits that make us who we are were already present in some form or another in the common ancestors of great apes, and we got lucky.   Off the top of my head, Laland, and Feldman. Try looking under evolutionary anthropology, mathematical anthropology, behavioral evolution, and sociobiology.   We're coming for you Indiana.   Unami    Since survival and reproduction are the most basic of all instincts, and intelligence has been the single most important factor that allowed us to overcome and dominate all other species on Earth and ensure optimal survival and reproduction, why hasn't any other species gone in the same direction?  Because evolution does not have a directed end goal. Intelligence has been very adaptive for us yes, but there is an infinite other ways of adapting which may be more fruitful. Smarter is not always better--all adaptations involve some kind of trade-off, and big brains are particularly expensive to pay for energetically speaking. Intelligence is really hard to make work in terms of cost vs benefits.    E E labs are more likely to earmark certain students to join their lab rather than just having a pool of students admitted to a program.  This is true, and is not necessarily a bad thing. I think "earmark" is an understatement; in many E E programs, it's pretty much a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for getting admitted that (at least one) PI wants you to join the program and their lab. The 'earmark' is the vast majority. Conversely, it means that applicants should apply with a particular research area and PI in mind whom they have already contacted. Fit is important for E E admissions. The best thing you can do to improve your chances of getting into an E E is to research potential PI and contact them about joining their lab before applying. (This can also save you the trouble of avoiding applying to programs where your potential PI isn't taking students or is moving to another institution).   Yeah, basically the ability for the gene regulatory system to adapt to new environmental inputs is itself hardcoded into the genes, albeit in a complex way. The only part of the criticism against the selfish gene that I may agree with (though I haven't given it much thought) is that the gene concept itself is poorly defined, especially in the face of complex nonadditive networks of gene interactions underlying phenotypic and thus fitness differences.    I've been using the undergrad rates as a rough guideline for lack of better information.  Don't, it's useless. You won't find any of that info online. It depends on how many and which advisors may be looking for new students which depends on how well funded they are recently and also the preferences of labs and programs for cohort size and various departmental and institutional factors and also how well-known the institution and more importantly the program are and also how popular a particular field is at the moment. Sometimes programs are looking to expand, sometimes they have had recent hires who need grad students, sometimes they've had a change in chair or director of graduate studies, sometimes they're being squeezed by administration, sometimes they've had faculty who've left, sometimes they want to make up for low matriculation in the previous year, sometimes they want to make fewer offers because matriculation the previous year was high. The variance is large.   Only if you die a martyr.   It also helps to up the density of the atmosphere, the denser, the more 'aquatic' flying organisms will be. This also ties into the need to support a large mass with large energetic intakes; the largest real whales eat tonnes of tiny plankton, and similarly, either there should be some kind of `air' krill, seeds, or they descend to graze on canopies of flora, or they're some kind of photosynthetic. But yeah, the basic idea is similar to swim bladders in fish. The lighter than air gases could be produced by their microbiome. Defense is tricky, as bladders might be fragile, making them easy prey; bladder's would probably be modular.   Glutamates.   Kk. I know like very little about theory in cell/molec, so I was curious.   Those orifices are too wet.   Sometimes you just gotta know when to bail.   This question would be more interesting if it was strictly limited to mathematical principles. When you include all scientific principles as well, then yeah that includes basically every technological advance in human history.   Why do you think that? (your second line)   Hurray!   It costs fewer lives, and costs less money.   *"You can't take the sky from me..."*  	109

And if you want to get them all in there at the same time, prolly gotta make it a sports bar with good bar food and plenty of room and table games.  Which means a fair amount of expensive TVs and pool tables.   Where I live, a liquor license will run you 250k minimum to buy.  $3k a month to lease.  Beer and wine is $8k/yearly or so.   Word.  I'll dig in my library in a bit and see if any of the ones I have aren't posted up...   Those ladies are fat!  And awesome.  I would love copies, can I send you a flash drive and postage?   I have a handful of One Plate at a Time.  Where are you located.  Maybe I could cloud/Dropbox them up for you?    Also, look at you tube.  I know I have a number of full episodes of OPAAT in one of my to watch lists.  I just remember them being fairly terrible recordings with bad sound.   Thanks man, I appriciate it.  I've got the entirety of the Good Eats series as well.   I'm in New Mexico and public/pbs programming is fairily crap.  I did look up the Create website though and remember seeing that channel last time I visited New England.  Now I wonder if anyone has their TV set up to stream such things...   Dry a bunch and ground it to powder for malts, shakes, and fruit salad.   Chipotle cream.   I'm in a small town and I've exhausted the small amount of food stuff they have in the library.  Good call on the inter library loan, I've forgotten about that.  I'll be moving in a few months back into a metro environment, I will make sure and keep that in mind.   There were a lot of great shows on PBS and other local channels throughout the 80's and 90's.  Food Network used to run basically nothing but educational programming through the late 90's.  A lot of those programs (at that time) we're offered on VHS and DVD via infomercial type sales.  However, not much of it has wound up on the torrent sites or on streaming media.    I know people have copies of these things.  Would any of you be willing to load up USB drives and toss em to USPS?  I have a handful of things I would be willing to offer in swap...      Eggs, pintos with Hatch Green, Smoked Chimayo Red bacon, pink shit, and cilantro onion relish on house tortilla.   One 4" hotel pan is approx enough of one side (rice, veg, etc) for 40-50 peeps.  As far as the rice goes, if you can do it and your clients are happy with it, do it.  I personally have reservations as to consistency of quality.  But it is territory that I've had little experience with.  Prices are market price, or a static menu.  When it comes to catering, it is all a job by job contract as nobody wants the same thing.  $16/per head rates are low.  I was charging that in 2000.  Have you looked into what your competition charges?  Are they providing it all?  Plates, flatware, delivery, etc?  Will you be doing the same?  Or will you be showing up with a trailer, cambros, paper plates, and wet-naps?  Don't shoot yourself in the foot by undercutting competition to much.  You don't want to beat them in price, but in quality, service, and product.  Remember, once you establish your cheap rate, people will expect it and complain if they don't get it.  The minimum I charge is $20/person for a non-plated affair.  If you want plates, it jumps to at least $30/person.  Kebabs are not meatballs.  Just FYI.  Kebabs are a single piece of muscle cut to size.  I assumed smoking VS grilling for those, but the pain in the ass that I mention is the mixing, cutting, and forming.  They look great, people love them, and they are cost effective.  However, I would much rather spend another $30-50 in product cost if it saves me 2 hours worth of work.  As long as I can make a product that is just as good.  IMO, my labor in the kitchen should be yielding $75-100 profit per hour.  The whole point of the Q is to do food in batch, not single serving.  Every time your hands touch the meat, you should be touching 20 portions.  Not one.  Touching one is a waste of time.  Kebabs will kill you in the long run.  You want to do Turkish Q and keep it unique?  Go with goat and lamb.  If you must do chicken, sluvakis are the shit and are easy to set up a public friendly "sandwich making station".  Now, goat and lamb are not cheap.  Well, goat is cheapish.  And many would say it isn't worth it.  Fuck that.  If you want authentic, good, different, and to stand out, you must.  Just remember, you already said the golden ticket to offset the cost - hummus.  Keep your sides in check on the cost and that will balance the expensive protein.  Olives.  Buy olives in bulk.  I mean, for real.  I'm talking about 15 gallon containers of Kalamata in bulk.  Yes, storage sucks. But if you have proper storage, olives keep forever and are CHEAP.  Tapenade is a great side, fast to make with a processer, and people love it.  Something else you can do on the smoke is "oil cured and smoked citrus olives with rosemary and saffron."  Great side and perfect app finger food.  Baklava.  Learn how to make that stuff well.  Don't buy it, the difference is huge.  I can make about 150 pieces in an hour and I'm fast.  It is time consuming, but oh so worth it.  People notice and will talk about it if it is good. If you want a crash course, I'll tell you to talk to me after you've figured out how to run melted butted through a spray bottle.  That isn't snark BTW, but seriousness.  Ok.  That's enough for now!  More questions?   The buns are white bread grocery store $1 for a pack of 8 buns.  So, not the biggest ones in the world, but not sliders either...   My friends were making pretty much this plate 10 years ago in Seattle...   Santa Fe checking in!    Ah..... Long beach.  Yeah.  They need to hunt Angel Wings, chanterelles, and chickens.   Surprisingly, not me.  Or at least by American standards.   I play with food.  Working on another menu currently, hence the porcini bacon.   Hot garlic pickle, caramel onion, colby jack, stadium mustard.  Porcini pancetta, sauted button shrooms, fontina, stone ground.  Hatch Green Chile, Smoked Chimayo red chile bacon, pepperjack, dijon.      Right product, right place.  I honestly like that stuff for what it is, but it isn't the right stuff for the job.  If you don't have a microplane, seriously pick one up.  It will help you make better food.    http://www.amazon.com/Microplane-40020-Classic-Zester-Grater/dp/B00004S7V8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1426870728 sr=8-1 keywords=microplane   You used the wrong kind of parm and the wrong kind of shredding to get the crust you want.  IMO.  The reason (IMO) it is underwhelming for folks is because they don't use the proper method.  Buy a microplane and get a GOOD chunk of parm.  Parm doesn't really get good until you hit about the $10/lb range...   Some of us around here are professional restaurant people.  If you have what you consider to be a solid menu, post it up.  That is one way that we can be of real use to you.  Do not, I repeat DO NOT do weddings as a BBQ outfit.  It is a disaster waiting to happen.  Been there, done that.  Not only are weddings a fucking nightmare, if anything goes wrong, it is the end of the world.  And if cousin Jimmy's little shit of a kid can't keep his hands and the Q sauce to himself, there are some seriously pissed off bridesmaids in ruined dresses.  Just pause and think about the wedding fiasco for a minute...  Smoked rice is a terrible idea.  Sounds great, but it will be dry.  Sure sure, in the backyard you might get it to come out just fine.  Different story when you're talking in batch and you don't have another 90 minutes to whip up a new pan of rice.  If you want to run rice in the hot chamber, do a plastic and foil wrap on the pan for a steam catch.  Kabaabs are a lot of work.  A lot of work.  Especially when you start talking about needing 300 portions worth.  Plus you have to soak skewers and you run the risk of charred wood in your food.  Then you have to think about the ease of people eating it on the plate.  #1 rule in the restaurant kitchen when it leaves the line window destined for the customer is "Nothing on the plate that you wouldn't want to eat.  Period."  No ramekin of sauce, no fucking bay leaf, and no skewers.  I would suggest figuring out a different way to control portion than with skewers.  I got plenty of thoughts for ya.  If you have real questions, ask away.  And take to heart what 3rdIQ said too.  Good stuff.   This is the wrong time of year for both of those.  Also, the King isn't known to be very prolific in the area.  Very rare in my extensive tromping around the NW.  For morels, head out to the northern Cascade range area in about a 4-6 weeks.    Also, there are some known historical burn areas in the Clallam area, as well as around Lake Chelan.  Discovery park in Seattle is also known as a hotbed of Morels since the burn in the late 70's.  I grew up on the Columbia in the SW WA and NW OR area and walked those hills for 20+ years.  If you want to give a more localized area where your friend is at, I can point to valleys filled with all kinds of goodies.   Brand new and shiny when you're done!  Best grab a grill brick too...   Powdered citric acid and a 1:1 solution of 5% white vin and water.   It might be.  However, if the obvious "go to school, get some background, and obtain an education in the field" is overlooked and the internet is the first place to look for direction, snarky is all that is deserved.     Well.  Since you're such a great chef, you'll have no issues just slapping it together!   Stop calling yourself a chef.  You're not one, aren't even close to being one, and those that deserve the title laugh at you when you call yourself one.  Just FYI.  After you figure that out, start developing your palate and wash dishes faster than the dishwasher.     Considering that you allude to the fact that you think you are some sort of mythological creature and are acting in ways which are in complete violation of Wheaton's law, I don't believe that anyone will find me at fault for pointing out that you are behaving like an asshole and  exhibiting asshole behavior.  So now I will ask you on behalf of the internet to kindly go fuck yourself.   Actually, I know you exist.  I've met you and you're an asshole.  I never claimed to be an atheist.  It is very presumptuous to think what i know.  But then again, you're an asshole.    No.  I just know that you, or whomever it is you choose to play on the soaps, is a complete asshole.  Or you wish you could be as inflammatory as the ones who will be forgotten over time in a desperate bid for attention.  Not only are the religious myths being proven wrong on a daily basis, it is deplorable that there are individuals in the world who still choose to be brainwashed into believing that gang banging little children and killing brown people will bring them salvation.  Everyone has a right to their voice.  Nobody is debating that.  But when you spout such utter bullshit as you do, don't be offended when others either drown you out with logic, reason, and fact.  Or just tell you to sit back down in the corner and go fuck yourself.   Religious people = good and atheists = bad.  You have proven yourself, beyond question, that anything which comes out of your mouth is to be regarded as complete and utter bullshit.     Your handwriting is very nice.   A very effective way to not lose money in your establishment would be to hire people who actually knew how to do such things instead of trying to get their employees to rat out others for being non productive.  But then again, we're talking about preventative maintenance which most people don't want to do.    Fucking Google.com   These are terrine molds for pate's and other types of forcemeats.     Yes.  Go with lodge.   I'll second the referral request, if there is one.    No.  Just pure it and finish your soup with some fine herbs...   Piss poor.     Inside the Caldera for the most part.  And halfway through route 4 between Jemez Springs and Cuba.   Very nice.   If you want to buy and ship me a couple of flash drives, I'd be happy to load up the entire series of Alton Browns good eats for ya.  Plus I got all kinds of other good food related videos.  but if you're willing to torrent, you can get them yourself.   And there are about 40 full length episodes of his shows on your tube.  There is also bunch of the same stuff on Amazon prime.   all you need to know is that you should just work your way down the list, trying them all.   She does it again, call animal control and file charges of abuse.  There is no reason to hit an animal.  Unless it is an animal that is a spiteful cunt who doesnt understand how the world works.  Dogs chew things.  Don't leave shit out.   Yeah, I've heard all that before.  Now let's get into science.  The reason bacon is so delicious is because of the fat.  When you submerge the bacon in hot oil, all the fat leeches out.  When you use a flat or a pan, it cooks in its own juice.  Deep fried bacon is essiently carbon :(  I have never, in my professional cooking career spanning continents and years, encountered a kitchen that thought it was ok to deep fry bacon.  In fact, that is a dumbass offense and one warning.  IMO, basically a fireable offense for making shitty product to sell to customers.  You wanna know how to kill your business?  Deep fry bacon.   new Mexican here.  Sounds delicious.  However, chile is not chili.   Google images.  Search for a particular dish and you'll find hundreds of examples of what not to do and 3 or 4 good ones.   Deep frying bacon gives a quality product?  What?   I need coffee.  But I have all your answers.  Check the gallery below of my from scratch, truck ready sandwiches.  I'll be back online in a while, but can you give some more specs on your operation?  Pics would be awesome.  Menu? What kinds of sandwiches get the bacon? Is it add on? How much per order in customer cost and how much on the plate?  imgur.com/a/BYZRe   Some would call it dicey/shady/sketchy, but the snacks are decent and the drinks are strong.  My kind of joint.  However, I didn't know about the dogs on the patio part...   Santa Fe checking in!   Thanks for the tips!  We're up in SF and come down often to see family   bring the dogs.  And are always scratching our heads on where to go...   That is a lovely dish.  Not being near the ocean anymore, I don't have access to quality 'puss.  What part of Italy are you in?   I've owned restaurants. You claim to work in one.  Why in the fuck, after having worked in one, would you even consider buying one? Let alone, one that is failing.  What is this magic potion that you're going to pour on this place to make it profitable?   This.  Perfect pan and cheap cheap on Amazon.   thanks.     Both.  The eye of round was minced fine.   Mine came from the thrift.  But ok!   Here is how. And perfect every time. Honest.  Cut the ends off.  Salt liberally both sides.  No oil.  Place in a deep pan so they are under the lip.  Wrap the pan tight with plastic wrap.  Then with foil.  Yes.  If you don't know this trick, it will change your life.  About an hou and a half or until beets are fork tender.  350f.    Now the hard part.  While the beets are piping hot, take a wet towel and wipe the peel off.  Yep.  That simple.  Just wipe em off.  They are just hot and red beets bleed dye EVERYWHERE.  Then you should have beets cooked to about 90% doneness to finish however you like.      https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/2wh71s/i_will_never_grow_tired_of_carbonara_with_peas/   Taco bar.    Eye of round.  Needled, seasoned, and pounded thin with a stick.  Seasoned flour, egg, and flour for the fry at 375.   Where I'm from, it's ground beef gravy on the whole wheat toast with an egg. Shit on a shingle as we fondly would call that slop...   People keep talking about frozen biscuits.  What the hell?  This is a thing?  Honestly, WTF?  I mean, I'm well versed in food.  Trained, educated, studied.  All kinds of experience and have seen so much different product.  But really?  Frozen bischits?  So many people have chimed in saying this.  I'm honestly shocked.  I had no idea and NEVER in my life would have thought about buying frozen biscuits.  I'd just go without and have something else :(   Frozen biscuits?  WTF?  I had no idea.     "They're just on the end over there."   Cheers!  If you're ever passing through NM, shout.  I'll bring you a sandwich.   Dust VS Powder VS Seasoning IMO  Dust - non-salted mixed spice seasoning, fine powder with no granulation.  Powder - a single spice, partially granulated.  Seasoning - several spices mixed with salt, partially granulated.  There are applications for each.  And in all honesty, I would rather just drop a plate in front of you and say "eat your fucking snack" and walk away.  But the internet demands one be nice and for some reason identify EVERY. FUCKING. THING. on the plate.  It honestly annoys me to no end and if anyone asked in real life what that was, I would say B G with eggs and pot.   I am not southern enough to make them properly either.  I probably need a little bit more of them grits, and gravy, and a hush yo' mout.  However.  I know this place.  This Loveless you speak of.  I knew a guy who lived out that way for a while and I heard all about that place for about 2 years before I was about to visit him.  And I hope that the owners take pride in standing next to the devil.  Because only someone completely fucking evil would make things so awesome that they can't be replicated at home.     I used to drink a lot of soda.  Then I realized I drank way to much.  After a while, I realized it was the carbonation that my body craved, not the caffeine or sugar.  So I started buying bubble water.  One of the best gifts that has ever been given to me was from an ex GF.  My Sodastream machine.  I only use it to carbonate water.  However, it is a godsend.  I was going through cases of bottled water like I would soda.  For me, the inconvenience of having to replace gas cans and the initial cost of the device is worth it.  Less packaging going to waste for one, but a can of gas carbonates about 2.5 times the amount of water you would pay for at the store.    Just something to think about if you don't own one.  Especially if you opt for the soda and lime out at the bar/restaurant instead of a coke ;)   Just a couple of basics...  Stay away from white drugs.  Don't fuck the hostess.  You're not a chef.  Please don't insult the word because you were hired to work in a kitchen.  I know you probably don't know better.   In most places, you are correct. There is no sausage present and there is only one biscuit.  This passes as a half order round these parts ;)   I made it.   basted with ghee.   I've got your brownies dialed down.  It will take digging in some notebooks, but I'm doing that anyways.  When I find it, I'll post it.  It is solid all the way around, uses coconut oil and margarine.  Not healthy exactly, but it is vegan and chocolate.  On a different note, my GF is a veggie.  I usually eat what I make for her, but I'm the housewife.  So tonight for her, I'm making fried tofu, fresh cucumber, carrot, spinach, quinoa, and ginger sesame zucchini fresh rice roll wraps.  Oh.  And the pickled ginger.  Can't fuck with the pickled ginger.    Thank you so much for this.  I am by no means a vegan, but have several friends who are.  I cook for them from time to time and am always looking for good inspiration.  Especially good, from scratch food.       Yep.  That is pretty much about it.  Can't get more basic than that and oh so addictive...   Word up on the MSG.  The chile seasoning on the potatoes has a little bit of the magic fairy crack ground into it.   Goddamn you for posting a link to that pan.  I've wanted one a long time and have never picked one up.  Every time I think about ordering one, I get something different that I know I'll get more use out of.  But now that I'm making individual quiches and baked eggs for my GF's lunch, that pan might just be the ticket!  Wild boar.  Not bad, had not done that one yet.  Funny enough, I was just talking about wild boar sugo with an Italian cook friend.  I'll mention this one.  If you ever have a chance to get your hands on some 'gator bfast sausage, that is the fucking shit when it comes to B G IMO.   I was told ya'll might like some of my from scratch snacks...      In that case, something else you can try is doing butter infusions to make your roux.  Notice i said infusions and not compounds.  The difference being is that with compounds you leave solids behind in the fat which can burn and ruin the sauce.  An infusion is essentially steeping dried(!) spice in butter and then straining it off.  Clarifying it at the same time.  If you build a roux using an infused butter with (fennel, rosemary, hot chile flakes, black pepper, and sage) whatever, you can make a good enough gravy without the meat which people love too.   Grab yo' ass a cracker.   I would say yes.  My basic recipe is 2 cups flour, 1/2 cup diced and frozen overnight butter, 1 tsp salt, 4 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp baking soda, and 1 cup liquid (this time it was cultured goat buttermilk).  Mixed with the lightest hand possible and let rest for 30 min.  Brush with wash and crack pepper over top  450F for about 20 min, till golden.    To me it is a scone mix, but without the sugar.      So many different varieties of both of these  things out there.  This is the last batch I made.  I will post the recipes for the plate later on, heading to work shortly.  But I would like to hear what kind of B G ya'll are making.  Be it mornay sauce with herb drop biscuits or red eye gravy and buttermilk.  Lets hear about it!  Saffron and Rosemary ghee basted eggs  Sour goat milk biscuits  Smoked red chile lardon gravy  Triple cooked home fries with chile dust  Fried sage  http://i.imgur.com/5Ze9LKm.jpg   Man, the separation agreement.  That is something that many, many people miss.     ingredients   http://i.imgur.com/csfwx8M.jpg   Yeah. I could just see you licking your finger and taking a taste.  Been there, done that.  One of the better applications for the SG is savory, rather than sweet.  FYI if you don't know.   That little box is strong and powerful stuff.  If you add 1 tsp SG to 1 cup of any other spice seasoning mix, you'll see a difference.  I also like grinding it into the salt I keep on hand for French fries.   That really looks fantastic.  Meat looks great, good thickness on the pickles.  Fresh veg instead of slaw is always nice.  But those mushrooms killed it for me.  Maybe it was delicious, I dunno.  To each their own when it comes to making your own snacks.  WQould you make it again with the shrooms?  It looks like it would withstand the one handed sandwich test, which most pulled pork does not.  So very nice.   Sazon Goya aka MSG.  Sprinkle on everything in sight.  The magic crack.   It would be lovely if you showed us some of this rumored "best work."     Obviously, you do not work at my girls hospital.  They burn water :(   you should check out the other thread in the sub that is the finished product...  But I'm glad I have your attention!  Because you, YES YOU, can make your own jerky too.  It's really easy and if you haven't, I suggest that you do.   Scam.   I used russet for these.  Chop em up.  Bring em to a boil in salted cold water.  Strain.  Freeze IQF style for at least an hour, preferably overnight.  Fry at about 250ish for 5 min.  Strain and freeze IQF style for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.  Final fry is at 375 until golden.   Thanks.  That is what I shoot for.      Worst sauce, fermented black soy, honey, molasses, sweet hot mustard, dried flake garlic, smoked crushed red pepper, ground black pepper, smoked paprika.   Plain and basic for the most part.  Slice, season liberally, let sit 24 hours, and in the dehydrator until desired texture.     Yep.  If you scroll down in the sub, you can find pics after it was seasoned.   Smoked Chimayo Red on the left  Roasted Hatch Green on the righ      Publicity.  And bad attempt at that.  They knew they'd get a reaction.  But oh man, did they fuck up.  They just managed to piss off one of the most dedicated group of people that have never had their anger issues resolved.  RIP those motherfuckers.   http://i.imgur.com/azrGOhr.jpg   With a shotgun.

 Ah, I guess I need to rewatch the finale. But even so, I don't think the finale was "fucked", nor did it ruin the series.    It actually made more money than Salvation the first weekend   That's assuming that the Porn site still has the same virus from 5 years ago because other than that, Chuck is not 's bomb expert.  And the reason why is Sarah loved Chuck is because he never changed. Over the seasons Chuck grew in many ways, but his personality and confidence in himself never really did.   Yea. That wasn't great but it also didn't ruin the good seasons for me   He produced some great movies but that role is what I have and always will remember him for. It's a classic   I understand that. Still not a bomb. A bomb would be if it made $70 mil by this point total.    I think the critics were too harsh on Terminator Genisys. I thought both movies were good and entertaining.   Also. T5 is not a bomb. It's not exactly a hit but it didn't bomb. It has already made $130 million worldwide. It will likely recoup the cost of the movie and make some money as well.    Who knows if it will, but damn would I love that!    I mean, we can't say exactly for sure what was a lie or truthful but from what we do know, he made it seem as if he didn't know that the i-rex had those features but knows why it inherited them.    I actually thought that the Chuck finale was one of the best ever. It was supposed to leave you wondering but give you a little hope. It's also still potentially open for a movie someday.   For me it was How I Met Your Mother. Killing the mom ruined any potential rewatch of an episode or the series. Now watching the comedy show is just a downer because you know that every story old Ted is telling is a sad story about how he met his wife and she died. If it were a drama, that would be a fitting ending. Or if there wasn't the narrative that it is all stories being told from the perspective of a future Ted.    They were not allowed because he was working for InGen. And the two that you mentioned were not even known by Dr. Wu. He figured out why they were traits but didn't know they would be traits because they were creating an entirely new dinosaur from multiple DNA strands. Unknowing which traits would actually come from which strand.    Either way, the radio/intercom system was disrupted so it would have been the result. Even so, if it did escape then, it would have found a way when they were to move it for the attraction or some other way because it is adaptive and intelligent.   Also, you could say the same about a lot of things in the Jurassic Park franchise.   1. If the kids would have never turned on the light, the T-Rex may have never found them and the whole chain of events after may not have happened.   2. If Hammond didn't decide to let the animals live on the 2nd island (even though they were supposed to die naturally), the whole 2nd movie wouldn't exist.   3. If the kid and his step dad didn't go parasailing in a no fly zone, the entire 3rd movie wouldn't exist.   I don't believe any of those because  a little suspension of disbelief is required for movies about dinosaurs in Modern times. Especially when it deals with human characters making mistakes.    4,5,6,1,2,3  People will tell you different ways that they think would be best but I'm pretty sure every one of them saw it in the above order for the first time. It's the way they were released and the way that most people saw them for the first time.    That was definitely the best episode yet. I really like The Brink too. I think maybe a little better than Ballers so far   There are plenty of sitcoms better than Breaking Bad as a sitcom. Seinfeld, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, etc.   Now as the drama that it is, not much rivals BrBa   Great band!    I agree that Jai Courtney was a bad choice for Kyle Reese (but he still did a good job) but I thought Emilia Clarke and Jason Clarke were great.   The writing was not bad. No worse than any of the others. Even though the Terminator and T2 were great movies, they both had some cheesy jokes and lines as did this movie.   Yes, the spoilers in the trailer bothered me too. And it does have a ton of CGI but that doesn't bother me because it's a Hollywood action movie. As were all of the other ones. Let's not pretend that the other movies are film noir just because they were ahead of their time and superior.   The characters achieved killing Skynet which is pretty much the goal of every movie. Kyle Reese grew from a soldier with no hope on a mission to save Sarah Connor to a vulnerable human who may have a future and is being saved by Sarah and what he believes is his enemy. Sarah grew from being a scared orphaned child, to a hard young woman, and then to open up to Kyle.   Even if you don't like the movie or the action, there was plenty of real risk of danger. Every moment they were in danger. I felt that John Connor as a villain was finally a step up from the T1000. He was harder to fight and kill.   It's nowhere near innovative or as good as T2 but it's a solid sequel to a action franchise. It was entertaining.    Even if it did tank (which it didn't, it still is projected to do better than Salvation), what does that matter?   I've seen a bunch of movies that were not box office hits but were still good. Even blockbusters.    I actually loved the new one. And for you to say that you are sad to see the numbers yet you haven't seen it and won't see it? No, it's not T2 but it's a solid follow up.    I've seen him in A Good Day to Die Hard and Terminator Genisys now and I don't understand the hate. He is a good actor. A little plain but he's Australian and does a very good American accent.    I loved the movie, but yes, I would have liked to have had that be a surprise.    1. Season 2  2. Season 5  3. Season 3  4. Season 6  5. Season 1  6. Season 4  Just so people know, there is a huge Gao between the last two there (Seasons 1 and 4).   We never actually saw a working Skynet headquarters other than in Salvation. The terminators are a product of Skynet which is the main software. So it having a "face and name" is logical to control everything. It could have been text too but it's easier for the audience.   Yes, it was a T800 but it was also the first T800 and John had already fought more advanced ones. They learned each time and became more advanced. And is not as if the T-800 ever took a beating or got beat. Also, that was only the first attempt to catch John Connor. All of the other attempts are technically in Skynet's future.    I'd say watch the teaser and maybe the first trailer. After that, stay away.    Well, the terminator franchise ARE action movies. And this one brought something new to the franchise that we had not seen in the terminator movies. Post Apocalyptic war.   Skynet did not have a face and the voice was only the computer. If you watch it, it stated that it made a face that would be easier for Marcus to deal with. It was still just the computer system.   As for Skynet making mistakes, you  need to realize that first of all, most movies don't kill main characters. 2nd, it is early in the timeline and the terminators weren't as advanced as in the rest of the movies because they are from the future.   I guess I just see your examples as nitpicky for a action movie franchise.    I still have ticket stub for Jurassic Park from when I was 3 years old...it was mind blowing and I watched it on VHS every year growing up.   Other than that, I don't really keep them anymore. Every once in awhile I'll find a fairly old one somewhere in my room or in a box or something, but not on purpose.   Yea, I really am a big fan of Jason Clarke though too. I haven't seen the new one yet though. Going tomorrow   I watched it really liked it. Not as good as T2 but still good. Same thing with Salvation. It was different but good   Harrison Ford for Movies, Martin Sheen for TV   Because again, it's not being judged on its own but against season 1. They aren't doing the same thing as last season so automatically people compare two very different seasons. Season 1 hit it hard in the beginning, maybe season 2 plays slower and slowly more and more begins to be revealed. Maybe it does end up not as good, none of us know because we've only seen two episodes.   Plus, no one had another epic season of True Detective to compare to when season 1 aired. Now it has left unreal expectations for most.    But again, you are comparing. This is an Anthology series so it is bound to be different each season but have the same style.    Let's talk True Detective season 2 when it's done.... Not two episodes in and comparing to a full season.    I just watched all of them for the first time, why so much hate for the 3rd and 4th? I liked them both   Well said   You are right but what I meant is that I and many others believe the Nielsen system is flawed. It takes a sample audience to measure their numbers. Not only that, it's not a random audience, you have to be a picked as a "Nielsen Family" for which no one knows their algorithm. So it's the same people every time. For example, the Big Bang Theory gets 15 to 20 mil people each week. I don't doubt that a ton of people watch that show but I think that maybe of their "sample audience", they picked more people who would typically watch a show like that rather than venture out and watch something that is supposedly low rated like Parks and Recreation.   From what Dan Harmon has said about Community's season on Yahoo, he has said way more people were watching than what the Nielsen numbers showed. But we also haven't seen data so who knows.    Don't be a cheap ass. If you can't pay for it, then you shouldn't get to watch it.    I suspect it's just waiting to be found. That is a good question to ask JK when she does those Q A's!    Why thank you!  I particularly am fond of Order of the Sith since it also ties in the "New Order".    No news on it but I would love that   Harry's cloak and the elder wand have been featured since the first book/movie. It's also mentioned that invisibility cloaks are very rare and ones that don't eventually fade are unheard of. The Elder Wand has been under possession of Dumbledore without us really knowing but it's the most powerful wand ever made. But it's been there. The stone first showed up when the ring did in HBP. And the story of the Deathly Hallows was part of the lore but just unheard by the audience until the final book.   All 3 make the Deathly Hallows and the most powerful wizard if together. To have 2 of them in such close range and under our noses the entire time was amazing to me. And they are two things that helped both Harry and Dumbledore do things others could not.    I click your link and this is what shows up.  http://imgur.com/Ugyp8k9   No, actually you did. Either that or it got removed. Your post that you shared some person's post from 2 years ago is gone.   Since you deleted your comment as i was replying, here it is:  Ever think that different people may think differently? The only season i ever thought lacked in quality was season 4. After that even, the show was great. And you post one post from 2 years ago? I don't mean to speak for an entire fanbase but from what ive seen, yes, for better and worse, we are a very passionate one. I never changed my tune, some people may have, but ive loved the show since day one.   Why do you go out of your way picking fights with Community fans. I literally only mentioned it in passing and you picked a fight. You dont want to see posts like this about Community, then don't fish for them. THAT's embarrassing...   Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens  Star Wars VIII: Order of the Sith  Star Wars IX: A New Republic   The internet says you are wrong https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(TV_series)#Critical  EDIT: Oh, I see, you just like to troll Community fans. Just based off the 3 times in the first scrolling of your comments that you did that.  You don't like Community, fine. Its not for everyone and frankly, i dont care that you dislike it. I still got 6 seasons of a great show. So go ahead and troll all you want.    I've only ever been a casual viewer of reruns but I didn't know a lot of people hate it.   That's my point. It's a flawed system that the Networks rely on. I don't wait to watch anyway. I will watch right away so I can at the very least let other people know it's good so there is buzz about it   I didn't use rioting as an example, just an analogy. And it still does work because you made my point. It's a protest that is affecting subs and people that have barely anything to do with it. The mods are protesting and affecting all of the people who subscribe to the subs that don't want that sub involved.    No. I love AMA's and hope that is restored (especially for Victoria) but why mess with other stuff and other people for something barely related.   That's like when people riot, loot, and destroy things in protest of something that is not related. It's only hurting and affecting innocent people   It's a cycle. The networks think no one is watching a show because of Nielsen Ratings so they cancel it premature. Viewers stop watching new shows because of the lost investment too many times for prematurely canceled shows.   Me personally, I still watch new shows even if it might get canceled. Yea, it sucks going through Cancelation but sometimes you get lucky like with the show Community. That had Cancelation threats since day 1 but we got 5 network seasons and 1 online.    Yes I do.    And the ministry of magic wasn't? They don't care. They are reckless.   LotR is battles for most of the movies and books whereas it only happens twice in Potter. They wouldn't make much sense without it. Braveheart is one single movie so that's a terrible comparison.   Deathly Hallows Part 2 was pretty much all battle. It was happening even when we don't see it but we do see quite a lot of it.  The movies made a point that the battles aren't the most important thing, and I agree with that. You clearly don't but why are the battles so important? The first one is redundant with the much larger one looming and the second doesn't have much to do with the plot line other than that it is happening and people we love are dying, which we do see.    People have these threads all the time but honestly, I wouldn't change a thing about the movies. There isn't a single scene that I would add because each movie is great the way it is. The things that are left out are what make the books great too. If they were perfect adaptions, I probably wouldn't have much interest in the books because, in general, I prefer cinema to literature.    Absolutely! And those fish tacos ARE the tits. I've been to that place (James Beach in Venice) a bunch of times and they truly are incredible, haha   Mac and Me   I Love You, Man.   Honestly one of my favorite comedies of all time   I'm a big Paul Rudd fan but even I thought it was an odd choice at first but seeing footage and the early buzz, I'm excited. I'll wait to hold judgment until I see it.    At least you had a feeling either way...    Yea, Fury Road just gave us a bunch of characters with no context, depth, or development (except Furiosa) that left me not care about any of them.    Community. It's complex, funny, weird, and has a lot of heart   The action didn't do much for me in Mad Max: Fury Road. It was entertaining and cool that it was mostly practical but wasn't the most exciting to me.   I personally enjoy to see practical effects but if the CGI is good then I don't mind.    He is a very odd guy but actually a really good actor. I still enjoy his movies.    Yes, I do understand that. But I do think both shows should be separated from all of the other stuff. I don't read the comics and have had stuff spoiled because of this convoluted sub. It would be nice to start fresh for the other show and keep it separate.    This looks great!    It focuses on it as much as Sorcerer's stone Prisoner of Azkaban, and the Order of the Phoenix. It's the beginning of that storyline. The entire movie doesn't focus on it but a decent portion is spent on it.  Yes, the battle was protecting the castle. So was the battle of Hogwarts. It gave more to the final battle not showing it. Snape is a Death Eater. And no one knew that it would be Snape to finally kill him except Dumbledore. The death eaters notoriously travel in packs. If anything, they were there to make sure Draco didn't mess up and to actually see Dumbledore die. Even in the book, there was no guarantee of a battle. It's not as if the Death Eaters came just because they knew a battle would happen. By that logic, there should have been a battle in GOF and OotP.    The plot is about trying to figure out what/where the Horcruxes are. And it's Harry's last normal year at Hogwarts. It has heart, humor, and everything I love about HP.   Draco has a great arc. It's his internal struggle. And the Death Eaters get in to finish Draco's task (kill Dumbledore) which is a massive task and they do succeed. The reason there was no battle is not because of time nor because the director hates battles. It was because he felt it would give more build up to the final battle for which if it was in HBP, the battle of Hogwarts would just feel like another battle rather than THE battle.   The reveal of HBP is lackluster yes. It's not really meant to be a giant reveal, just more so another thing to make us wonder where Snape lies and how that conflicts Harry.   As I said before, it's my favorite because it has everything I love about Harry Potter and it's intriguing as hell. Less action sure, but much more backstory (even more in the book).    Half Blood Prince is my favorite movie and book for different reasons.    Yes, but it's not really unrelated if you post about FTWD in the TWD sub.    Nah, "Guilty pleasure" is just another phrase for being embarrassed to admit you like something for fear of being made fun of. I own up to the things I enjoy      I recorded the pilot and have not had a chance to watch it yet. Glad to hear that it's good!    Baconreader. It's simple, easy to use, and has great features. It's not as aesthetically nice to look at as others but it is functionally better.    This is a great documentary. I posted it a couple months ago and got a few responses but not much. I hope more people find it.   It's a documentary of behind the scenes of making a single episode from start to finish. The type of footage in the Doc has never been seen before and it's really well done.    The Brink  The cast is great do far and it's really funny. Switches back and forth from serious to funny so quickly.    There is not going to be any control for where people post and discuss but id rather it be separated and posted to /r/fearthewalkingdead   I still would love to attend Nicholas Cage: Good or Bad as a class   I love Nicholas Cage. Has he made some bad decisions for movies? Yes, but he is a good actor.    Have fun! Have a Hot Butterbeer! It's not really advertised but it is the best version   Frank's Brother. Which is weird because it is also in my favorite season of It's Always Sunny.   My local theater has IMAX with tickets set at 12 bucks, rewards programs for concessions, is very clean, and best of all, has full leather recliners for every seat and a stocked bar.   I know. I know. I've seen bits and pieces on TV but never in full   Do you think I will need to see Rise of the Machines or Salvation before seeing Genisys?   I just rewatched the original last night and plan on seeing Judgement Day tonight for the first time (I know I'm late to the party).   I watch Shark Tank, Survivor (still as great as S1), and then a bunch of the history channel shows (Pawn Stars, Counting Cars, American Restoration)    He is a great moderator and a huge fan so for people who don't know him, this is a very good thing   Luke Skywalker. I am so excited to see Mark Hamill back in that role.    I can't believe none of us noticed it in about 8 years since the release!    Yup, can't wait   You made points to support his argument. They harvest the "essential post-apocalyptic stuff". So how/why is the electric guitar/flamethrower and amp rig essential?  Its fictional but even within the context of the world in the movie, it doesn't make sense.    I never saw the other movies and although I didn't hate the movie, I also didn't think it was great either. Entertaining for sure, but not much more than that for me.  Cinematography was great and I loved the cast. But it was, as you said, a two hour long car chase. It became repetitive. It didn't have a lot of plot or character development. I felt nothing for any of the characters other than Furiosa. Even when Immortan Joe died I didn't really care. I should have been excited but I never really felt like he was a real threat.   It had its moments but was not perfect for me.    I love it so far. 2nd episode was even better than the pilot   This was the major thing that took me out of the movie. I could believe  everything else happening within this world but that character just was too far fetched and cheesy for me.   I get that armies used to have battle music and this is supposed to be an homage to that but still it doesn't work. In a World where everything is decrepit and scarce, they somehow have an electric guitar/flamethrower with tons of amps and drummer's on the back.   Not only that, but they have people who are specifically doing that rather than fighting in this brutal age. And they weren't "going to war"  and having the typical standoff that traditionally had battle music, but were quickly chasing after an attempted escape. BUT they had enough time to gear up the guitar rig?  Of everything that is out there in this movie, this was the one thing that I just couldn't make sense of, even within this world.  Edit: Also, I'm a guitar player who likes rock music, so of anyone, this should have resonated with me but it just took me out of it.    He broke bad. He's now the bad guy that we cheer for.    That's because those are actually human actors doing the MoCap.    456123 Don't listen to the people who skip movies or watch them in weird orders. There is only release order and Chronological order. For a first time viewer, always do release order.       Not sure, i didnt stay there. Just checked it out while i was in Estes Park for a wedding. Had a drink at the bar where Lloyd (Jim Carrey) drinks all day waiting for Mary.   I love it. It has gotten better with each episode. I can understand how some people won't like it because it's dry but it is dry in a Curb Your Enthusiasm type of way.    Yup, I've been there and it definitely has more of a Shining vibe than Dumb   Dumber. It's a cool place though.    Nope, Glenn Howerton said that Nicky Potnik is not the Waitress and was only a misdirect.

Maybe she is not only concerned about whether something is effective, but also whether she is still in the right light? And maybe she just doesn't like, that you're doing good on your own (without her help), rather than *what* you are doing...   It's good, you're not gonna give her more infos, it makes you and your projects less "vulnerable". But still keep an eye on her behaviour... manipulative people don't like it, when things don't go their way and could not only sabotage projects, but also damage reputations.  I'm glad, that you know what I meant with "distance"! :) And I genuinely hope things will work out great for you.  	4
 How many governments have you overthrown? lets count!  since 1950 you have overthrown  Guatemala Iran S. Vietnam Chile Grenada Nicaragua Panama Afghanistan Iraq and last but not least Libya  good job   America has done about as good a job of policing the world as American Southern Cops in the 60's IMO   If you were born fearing being blown to bits every day, and the simple answer was "The Americans killed your neighbour, your friend, your brother" Who would you hate?   And Pinochet   So comparing one unelected individual to another is absurd.   Saudis are elected? lol  as for the other two, they murdered thousands of people, in Iraq or Gaza respectively, and targeted civilian areas, used uranium bullets etc   If you want to start jailing human rights abusers, start with Netanyahu, and Bush, and all the saud family.  	7
 welllll....besides the premise itself, they explain how awesome the security systems are.  Then the kids try to break in and Ethan hawke is like, "well ya know nothing's '100%' safe".  what???  Also it's not the son's first Purge right?  So why is he letting people in?  Why does the kid even have access to the security system to begin with?  Why would there ever be a scenario where for one night, do whatever you want,  because then for the rest of the year you'll be on your best behavior!  Then, it just turns into another lame american horror movie where all the bad guys HAVE to cock their head to the side while wearing a mask before they kill someone.  The girls HAVE to be in white dresses holding hands skipping around.  Pick an any American horror movie from the last ten years and I can almost guarantee it will have a young white girl in a white dress.  Then oh yeah the neighbors are psychotic killers too.  Shyamalan twist bitches.  It just, ugh was so bad.  Could have been a fun b-movie schlock fest but took itself to seriously.  the only reason I went in the first place was a second date with a girl.   That was our last date : )  And don't get me started on Sinister!  Why is there Academy Leader (the 3 2 1 countdown) at the beginning of the reels of footage?  Did the bad guy take the reels to get post production work?   The Purge was probably the stupidest movie I've seen in a loooong time.  Just dumb.

They could be recruited from the law schools, accounting programs, and military counter-intelligence. No one who had ever worked as a law enforcement officer would be eligible, and no former agents would ever be allowed to work in law enforcement. They would have jurisdiction over ALL law enforcement agencies and would themselves only be subject to investigation by the FBI. All lethal use of force by law enforcement would be automatically be investigated by this agency. Most agents would be located in regional offices and no agent would be allowed to remain in any office for more than four years. All of their cases would be tried in federal court and a new crime of "lying in the course of law enforcement activities" would carry a mandatory minimum ten year sentence.   RIP Spc.

A Swedish friend of mine once said to me, "The Norwegians are a bunch of stuck-up jerks and the Finns are just stupid rednecks." I've heard plenty of American stereotypes about Europeans and plenty of European stereotypes about Americans. What do you guys say about each other?   That is firearms per capita (ie. total firearms divided by number of people) I was reporting over 40% ownership rate (ie people actually own a firearm) The per capita rate in Iowa is likely significantly higher than 1.0. The homicide rate in Iowa was 1.4 in 2013. My point is that it is perfectly possible to live in a largely peaceful society with tons of guns. If you have a large number of assholes it doesn't matter what the rules are. For instance, Lithuania has a very low rate of gun ownership and a higher homicide rate than the US. I prefer to live in a society where my rights are not dictated by the lowest common denominator.   It also has a lower rate than Belgium and Finland for example. I don't know what rape has to do with this conversion, but Sweden has twice the rape-rate of the US and far more restricted firearms.    hell if you discount black people the US homicide rate comes down to near European levels.   Meanwhile, Iowa has a lower homicide rate than many European countries, almost no gun laws, and a firearm ownership rate over 40%.

It would be Texas in 50 years.   of course you would, easy peasy, for example see north america   The one person I know who went there was also a nutty girl that dropped out after losing her shit. Must be something in the water.   http://i.imgur.com/cxwwQ7c.jpg  That's my buddy sitting in the turret. No one in that truck had a scratch on them.  happened here: https://goo.gl/maps/dq5fX   they should pay teens 100 bucks a year to get a implanon, 10K to get a tubal ligation   that's what happens when you don't have a strong NCO corps   I found that guy!   The first couple looked pretty bad but I wouldn't assume everyone was killed. MRAPs/MATVs are fucking tough, during my deployment we had something like 100 vehicles hit by IEDs. Not a single death or amputation. Probably some TBIs but nothing that left anyone unable to function. All of our fatalities/amputations were guys on foot.   if they want people to continue lending them money   cars make suburban cities perfectly viable, it's almost as if certain modes of transportation are suited to certain lifestyles   maybe sometimes, I have extremely close access to public transportation and I still drive.   If I were you I would live in Worcester. Much cheaper and the commute would be way less horrible.   just think, they probably fucked your grandma!   This is actually a very legitimate tactic. The cop in question was the guy that likely actually made hits on Tamerlin and the department firearms instructor. Probably the most competent guy there. https://youtu.be/x28X4FK8Hkk?t=253   "highly trained"  lots of law enforcement firearms training consists of shooting at static targets - good for developing basic marksmanship but not much else, and simunition training. Simunition training is basically paintballs fired by gunpowder. Unfortunately this type of very valuable training often becomes more of a game than anything else. Training with sims  shouldn't be fun. We did a bunch in the Marines and it always sucked. Getting shot wasn't "awe darn you got me," it meant lying facedown in the road for a few yours or your fire-team dragging/carrying your ass a mile or two the the LZ for the medevac.   you really told 'em!   That's one way to bust the glass ceiling   *vomits furiously   right next to old fezzipoop ale   I'm triggered by your ableist slur, guess they didn't have a debate team in the dumpster   good thing your opinion doesn't matter   nope, but if you try to take the trash and put it in a nice recycling facility the dumpster will flip a shit. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a way to keep dumpsters from filling up with garbage?   "Good" -Eugene Sledge   idiotic  -typical  except she's already elected, she didn't need to help marry anyone    You said convenient and necessary, which clearly it was to get him elected. He lied about his opinion to help him politically, just like Polito. Don't change the subject, besides those efforts you cite happened AFTER he was elected. Im sorry your partisan blinders are so tight that you're upset that a Republican is supporting same sex marriage.    Obama was against it when he was running for president in 2008 and only 40% of Americans supported it. Be became for it in 2012 when he was running for election and 51% of Americans supported it. Same shit, different party.   This is part of the reason stitches cost so much. It's called stealing.   http://www.goarmy.com/   wow, you're really helping your argument! Maybe I've been wrong all along!! Don't worry, I don't think you should be allowed to own guns.   Did a gun touch your pee-pee?   depends on who the patient is, the majority of people I see in the ER are being paid for by tax dollars   Like Saddam, right?   "Five years after the Arab Spring: Middle East engulfed by war"   So when are they gonna build a homeland for christians in the middle east? Anyone got ideas for locations? Maybe the Syrian coast?    yea, sure worked out well for Haiti   "jamming problem" I'm gonna guess you've never carried an M4 professionally    man, butthurt germans can't admit their gun sucks. Go with the 416 like your SF if you want to buy domestic, it even uses the same gas system. Or could've stuck with the g3, THAT was a nice german piece.   just buy m4's and be done with it   and that's why their great-great-grandchildren will also be living in poverty   It should be a death penalty offense for a police officer to lie on duty.   I dunno, the one liver doner I know said it was much, much more painful than childbirth   then get licking, I just trimmed    Well gosh, if justice needs to be done anyone who has lived in the US for decades after coming from a war-torn third world shit-hole really should be investigated. Who cares about the cost. Really any immigrants from Africa, Korea, Vietnam, Eastern Europe, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and South America should be investigated. Or we could pay for things that actually matter in America. No one gave enough of shit to do anything in Rwanda 20 years ago, why should we care now?   it would be pretty funny to watch epic asskicking that would commence if they ever came to blows   Only 6 or 7 blocks from where those hippies blew themselves up in the 70's   Seems like justification to cut the DHS budget right there     	104
 I guess you could become butt buddies with a dev and get him to delete you from the database, or you could do it yourself but i'm guessing that's not an option if you're posting here.   Yeah.... I know; apparently reddit dosen't know the spoiler tag though.   JET FUEL DOSEN'T MELT STEEL BEAMS!111!1!!!   "An estimeed PhD cyber-psychologist"........   22 years of service and now hes a tour guide... */s*   So much cynicism on videos like this... sure he could have been a paid dancer but at the same time he could have just been a security guard that could dance having some fun. No need to act like a smartass about it, as if you have some inside info. Even if it was a plant, why are they trying to get the video viral? There's not even a product placement and the video isn't even on the colleges youtube - even if I wanted to buy a ticket to see him I have no idea where he is/who he works for.   Said a lot better here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9Ke2bMYBFs#t=88   *Now* you're thinking like AAA game devs!   Never thought my fetish would show up on reddit...!   10/10 british impression    Urgh people wanting more money for producing free entertainment. What a drag.   I'm pretty sure saying totes unironically is cringeworthy too   How do they know if she's right..? I'd guess they have someone typing the numbers as she says them or?   I had good experiences with NordVPN, and i've heard Feral is a good seedbox.   Some say she's still looking for Terry.   That's the problem with the entirety of reddit.    I mean you're not wrong, probably should have included those details, but IMO it's still better than PTN because it dosent make my eyes hurt.   Frasier: You know the expression, "Living well is the best revenge"?  Niles: It's a wonderful expression. I just don't know how true it is. You don't see it turning up in a lot of opera plots. "Ludwig, maddened by the poisoning of his entire family, wreaks vengeance on Gunther in the third act by living well."  Frasier: All right, Niles.  Niles: "Whereupon Woton, upon discovering his deception, wreaks vengeance on Gunther in the third act again by living even better than the Duke."  Frasier: Oh, all right!   Better off without them IMO. If you're looking for a good ratioless movie tracker try out BeyondHD. It's really only 'semi' private but they have all the new releases and some good internal encoders (famestor,legion). On PTN, their site design is so astoundingly bad it boggles the mind how people can use it on a daily basis.   Waffles is probably a good first stop, they have a lot of recruitment threads all over the place, and the requirements are never too high. Of course Waffles is still #2 to What.cd, so you could invest the time to learn the interview for WCD, which is the largest music tracker (https://www.whatinterviewprep.com/).   Wait - it checks if for AV and if it's in a virtual machine? Dosen't a malware only do that if it's looking bypass/hide from one of them?      Its from the bottom of the dudes shoe.   10/10   He's talking about BAN, never heard of it? Good, that's they way they like. (*/s*)   I love both and you are completely right.   what does the private key do?   can someone explain what the private key passphrase does? i assume it lets anyone simulate the cert or something?   Thanks!   Can someone explain this and the implications in laymens terms?   I mean it sort of is. Although i've never had anyone tell me this i'd just say its worth it if you like to torrent enough, pretty simple really, being able to download so much content easily outweights the 'work'.    The newer versions of utorrent are filled with ads..maybe it was doing you a service.  http://filehippo.com/download_utorrent/9859/  Download this, it's the most reccomended older version of utorrent. If you still get a warning then theres a virus on your computer that's changing the download links. Switch to ESET Nod32 (Norton is a POS) and run a full scan.   yeah most to all isps will do this. just change providers or ask reallly nicely saying you wont do it again...   That's not asking for an invite, that's asking for where they recruit from. You're not allowed to ask for invites, you are allowed to ask where x tracker recruits from. As per https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/wiki/rules   The subreddit is empty. Read the message on the gate. Sounds like your experience has been jaded somehow, and I apologise on behalf of whoever did that. I sincerely hope you decide to try and get back in, as its a rewarding experience with good communities, whose requirements aren't nearly as bad as you make them out to be... i'm nearly 5 months in and i'm in pretty much every private tracker I want to be (music,games,movies,tv) Greetings.   You have no idea what you're talking about. GazelleGames is in comparison with something like PtP or BTN is extremely easy to get into. They even have a recruiting thread on bB (/r/baconbits) where you just need to be a member for 1 month and have a ratio of 1.05, which essentially means just being a member for a month. No waiting for a year like you said.  The reason most private trackers don't open for registration (I think) is because they want to control the number of users, but the large majority of them have invite threads on 'gateway' trackers that require nothing more than power user (again, trivial to get).   Little anecdote, i've never seen something so aggressively marketed, saw it all over public transport over here in the UK. Usually just see one or two posters, even for games like Assassin creed. This was actually plastered everywhere, it was so out of the ordinary for me.   GazelleGames seems to have a nice collection.   Common knowledge they only have one policeman in Japan.   Well, they're in there because they're British, but they win because your game is the best British game.   Here you go: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2vihry/eve_online_nominated_for_persistent_game_bafta/coi47wy   https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2vihry/eve_online_nominated_for_persistent_game_bafta/coi47wy  Their defenition of persistent is...wildly different.   Look at this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2vihry/eve_online_nominated_for_persistent_game_bafta/coi47wy  ...  I have no words for how stupid this is.   I don't know why but his voice sounds a lot better in this video.   WHAT'S SO FUNNY? WHATS SO FUCKING FUNNY!?!!?!   /r/humblebrag   If they emptied their clip on me before that I say fuck them and just shoot them. I'm not kniving only when its convienient for them lol.   Some people think you say it regardless, others only if it was a good game (e.g. I would not consider 5v1 a good game). There's quite a few in both camps of thought.   Best reply.   Mostly the former I think. Coupled with them probably not having enough people submit their games for awards.   "Shitty"... this is the most prestigious gaming award (if you take it in the context of the 'main' BAFTA's). It's the only gaming award show to be broadcasted on TV ,BBC3. One of the most popular channels. Although I agree if by shitty you mean the fact that LoL and Destiny are in the same catagory.   http://www.ebuyer.com/174033-steelseries-s-s-mouse-pad-63001   http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B000ANEQFM/ref=dp_olp_new_mbc?ie=UTF8 condition=new  ?   Hi,  Looking for a new mouse, my lachesis just died on me after a few years (Razer). Is there anyone here that has the Kinzu/Rival and has big hands? I've gotten used to the lachesis which is pretty big.  Cheers   Any idea if any of those are ratio-less?   Hey,  After many years my lachesis finally gave up. Anyone that used the same mouse that knows of a good replacement? Preferably claw, needs to accomadate large hands.  Cheers.   You can eat some bacon raw.   What the fuck.   It's such a fucking weird pick for that catagory. All of my wat.   Also for Persistent World along with League of Legends...i'm so confused.   Good question. One i'm most confused about is League of Legends..... Dosen't the world 'reset' with every game played? They must be using a really broad defenition I guess.   With all the hype i could unfortunately see Destiny taking this, but i'll be cheering for EvE on the day!      I think the plate is 30 degrees below zero.         If only there was some way to turn down the sound.... hmmm... Let me get back to you on this, I think i'm onto something.   Astoundingly adorable.   You're asking the wrong question. What kind of cop dosen't stop every right minded person *from* buying a meerkat?   ComicBT recruits from bB. The requirements aren't that high either. /r/baconbits   Aaand its down   Except he dosen't play EvE anymore, lol.   I love how that one CT is so confused looking for it.. "It must be around here somewhere!"   Except he only talks about it in ts, while his friends say something through in-game VOIP once or twice.   Try watching the whole 45 minute game, or try to hear footsteps while that's playing. The kid also talked way too much. Plus they barely said anything rude to him, only on TS.   You should watch the whole game, it dosen't stop lol. And they never yell at him, only once does one of them say something negative about it in game and not in ts.   This is an uninformed opinion, but i'm guessing if a projectile can be fired from 10x the distance it can now it gives them a much larger engagement range, allowing them to be safter when attacking, or defend from farther away.   Script supervisor sounds like a cool job.   Awesome.   He's the antichrist. [S]atan.   My god have they ever heard of makeup? That dude looks like he hasn't slept in way too long.   Shoutout to /r/irlsmurfing ! Awesome sub.   Actually saw a guy holding a water gun in one of the other epsiodes.   https://www.youtube.com/user/Lomak1581/videos This guys channel is a justiceporn goldmine. Highly reccomend checking out the rest of the videos.   Smoking in some public places is illegal in Russia, they have dedicated smoking areas to stop passer bys breathing in second hand smoke. See: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21571418      Are both HDA and AHD ratio based?   You almost qualify for a bB interview: /r/baconbits read the message. From there you only have to get elite for an invite to WCD, or you could get into Waffles by being power user (takes pretty much no effort) which is #2 to WCD.   Holy shit this is hilarious.   https://i.imgur.com/OoX8nAf.png probably still not a fitting picture though   Cool idea but the indifferent being on a different line fucked it up for me.   Ignore the dicks OP. It was readable but maybe a better font choice (sans serif?) and a white outline would have done it some justice.   I actually thought that was aaron rodgers for half the video. God damnit OP.   He who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men. We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals.   Immanuel Kant   https://twitter.com/csgolounge/status/561629987850452992   Person running their twitter is mentally impaired.

Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6EtRWdsdbI   There was just a blog post about this: http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2015/01/11288/   Holy shit this picture is so trippy. It almost looks like a mirror or a printed out photo.   TS as in TorrentShack?   I use symbolic links to cross seed. Simply install this: http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html#contact and create a symbolic link of the file/folder, then use that for the other tracker.   Wasn't Aura the one on that soundcloud recording acting like a complete dickhead?   https://i.imgur.com/PHUyL6A.gif   then he should have never applied sorry (why even apply if you live in a completely different timezone, with even a remote possability of your schedule changing? what a waste.)   Speak for yourself, not me.   Wait how did they find out? Did you make the pastbin public?   Why do so many people leave the battle report out of the description T_T   You only need this one if you're in the CFC.   I swear these TLD's are getting out of hand.ninja   Just curious, not sure if you've stated anywhere else, is GGn being DDoS'd (I assume by IPT) or is it something else?   its fine just close your eyes - the emu's are onto something.   Uusally i'd agree, but this guy is shooting a portrait in portrait mode. I think that was what it was made for.   Yeah and make sure you persevere through learning the basics of the game (controls, navigation, etc.) that was the biggest learning curve for me.   Just out of curiosity, what's your average upload speed on a torrent (assuming just you seeding)?   Been down for like a week now, must be revamping that whole thing.   Or maybe she was just mentally ill? Or didn't mind taking responsibility for her actions? Or there were cops off camera and running would have made no sense? You're making a lot of assumptions for someone that knows almost nothing about the situation or the person. A true reddit detective.   Let's be real, we all did.    Made me laugh for the first time today. Thank you OP.   P...Poitot?  	121

Guess airplanes should never be used then because they use carbon fuels.  Hope you've never made use of an airplane.  Not just flown in one but received a package that came in one or known anyone who was flown in a helicopter to a hospital, etc.   Perhaps they should start with the business owners who employ them.   Then why not pay each employee $20 instead of $15?  $15 hardly covers bills if we're being realistic.   If 40 low wage workers can't give you a definitive summary on the socio-economic effects of a minimum wage increase in Seattle I don't know who can.  Surely not an economist from Forbes magazine.

 Great recs - love the Nasher!    Thanks! I'll have to check out Cafe Driade!    That he had nothing to hide. The lady was asking him if there was anything shady in his past the investigators uncover in his attempt to get custody of his son.   Thanks!    Awesome recommendations! Love Cafe de los Muertos!   Quick question - would it be weird to sitting outside with a laptop at Boylan Bridge since it's a bar?   Looking for any recommendations on good places or cool creative spaces where I can hunker down and do some writing. Anything from a coffee shop or a museum or a park or even a camping area. I'll take anything. Thanks!       Yes! This is what I needed!    If it takes roughly the same time as the Kansas City build out, it'll be a minimum of a year for the first homes to get service. And roughly another year or so for the first 30-X0% to get service.  All in all, I imagine it will take at least 3-4 years for everyone in the intended coverage triangle area to be able to actually get Google Fiber.    Ugh, please internet gods. #HannibalOnNetflix    Personally, I really liked the song until the chorus kicked in... then I liked it a lot less.   It's a shame they didn't use the song they played at the bar scene with the lyrics "this is my least favorite life." That was soo haunting!    The entire main cast was really awesome and on point tonight. Vince and Collin have surprisingly good chemistry and Rachel and Taylor did a great job playing really intense and emotional this ep.   Internet points for anyone who can find the artist and title of the song played at the bar with the lyrics "this is my least favorite life". My google fu has failed me today. The song is so haunting!    His accent definitely slipped a little when he said "I welcome judgement." Miss Ray.    Definitely agree on being lost for the majority of the episode. Obviously I got the broad brushstrokes of each character and their thing, but it honestly felt like I had tuned into ep 2 of a show and I had missed some critical bits of set up. However, I do like that the three main cop leads have converged by the end of the ep.     Honestly, I thought that was a little extreme and over the top even for a crooked cop with anger and drinking issues. To a 12 year old. Plus there's no way that dad doesn't have him arrested for assault in real life.    I like the fact that the three main cop leads have converged by the end of the episode, but I do feel like the overall set up of the episode was a little too vague. I got general plot threads that they were trying to convey, but I almost felt like I had jumped in on ep 2 of a show and I'm missing some critical set up information.    *"If you ever bully again, I'll butt-fuck your dad with your mom's headless corpse."*   I thought that was a little extreme even for a crooked cop with anger and drinking issues. To a 12 year old.    I'm sort of bummed they didn't use that song they played at the bar as the opening theme. The one with the lyrics "this is my least favorite life." Set such a good atmosphere for the scene.    Opening theme for any who are interested - Leonard Cohen's Nevermind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3HbrfV0hJM         Welcome again to your weekly dose of Hannibal cinematography. This week's episode was one of my favorites. The Lecter Estate was eerie and ethereal in it's green hues and the many scene transitions this week were especially well done.          Dude looks like he knows what he's doing... I could go for a nice scalp massage any day. Just sayin'    I thought it was parallel to Hannibal's "mind palace" which he carries around with him.    Let's not forget stalking Chiyo in the shadows or creeping on her while she's cooking.    The pace is definitely way slower and the cinematography and slow introspective bits really highlight each character's thoughts. Though I think now it's a good thing that Bryan Fuller decided to collapse two seasons into one here.   Definitely agree on the memory place shots - the fragments and reflections were not only beautiful but incredible metaphors.    Ditto. Though personally I'm looking forward to Will channeling his best inner Hannibal these next few episodes in order to catch him.    Hannibal: 1 Bedelia: 1    Also later when Hannibal's like "I can only claim one of those" and gives Bedelia that "ho, ho, ho look what I did there" look.     *"I was rooting for Mephistopheles and contemptuous of Faust"*  LOL Hannibal. I have no words.   I think him posing that body at the end of the episode was his love message back to Hannibal in a way.    I know this is a constant topic of conversation, but I feel like the cinematography was really top notch this episode.    Can we pause a moment to discuss the fact that Will was responsible for the moth man body posing that we previously saw in the trailers? Holy crap. He's really letting loose. He really acted like Hannibal this episode... seeing if Chiyo would kill, posing the body, even speculating on how he would kill Chiyo earlier.    ...you could say I knew him... intimately...   Tell me more about this heterosexual bromance, Bryan.    "Technically, you killed him."   ...very mature Hannibal...    Holy shit Will did that.    Intimately   I know right? I was shocked when FX announced it was renewed last year. Premise of the show sounds like it would be good but everything about it is terrible (thinking about about the pilot just makes me cringe... also everything about Jamal). My roommates and I hate watched this show last year and I suspect we will do the same this year.    Please let this actually happen this time... though I am concerned with the fact that it's on Starz. Just give Bryan and Neil full reign and don't meddle... guaranteed great results.   Too bad HBO passed on this. I guess this just really isn't mainstream enough.     Thanks for your comment. Very useful tips!    Yup   Well I don't think he knew Italian per say but he had been in Italy for a while. They mentioned he had been going to that church for a while before the murder happened.   Yup... that was the really noticeable one from this week's ep. I'm surprised they didn't make him redo the scene.       YES! I loved it... it was a real shame it wasn't picked up!    Aw thanks for the kind words!    Let's not forget the scene where Hannibal guts Will in the finale. The caressing... the impaling... the embrace...    Hannibal constantly surprises and exceeds my very high level of expectation for the show. It is really defying all odds to be in it's third season on network television.    Back again with round two of these.   Things that were especially outstanding in tonight's episode:   * The lighting - everything from the soft light of the windows and candles to the contrast of light and shadow on people's faces to the low, dim lighting of the last scene was outstanding.   * The use of symmetry - full throttle in this episode.  * Framing Will in tight, confined shots, lines, and spaces to convey a sense that he is trapped by Hannibal's designs.        Agreed - so sad!    I absolutely loved Pushing Daisies. Actually, one of the reasons I wanted Hannibal initially.    Love your analysis! Also, to add the fact that Inspector Pazzi comments that Will was already dead.    For reference: http://imgur.com/8HfDiL4   The beautiful, beautiful symmetry.       Why did you lie to him?"  "The wrong thing being the right thing to do was too ugly a thought.   :(    That surgery autopsy scene really bothered me for some reason. I got a little queasy even though I'm not bothered by any of the murder or gore of the show at all.     *"I splintered every bone. Fractured them, dynamically. Making it malleable. I skinned you, bent you, twisted you, and trimmed you, head, arms, and legs."*   Man poor Anthony... RIP our lovely poet who only wanted to have a good time. :(    He may not believe himself to be God, but a god certainly. Hannibal definitely has a God complex.    Hugh Dancy is English - his accent slips a few times in this episode.    I'm so glad it didn't have a face.    Young "Il Mostro" be looking fly as hell.    "I'd say the homoeroticism is more me just cackling in the editing room, as opposed to something that the characters are genuinely feeling when they're in the room with one another," Fuller explains.  *"Valentine written on a broken man."*  *"I do feel closer to Hannibal here. God only knows where I would be without him. He left us his broken heart. He knew we could come."*  Ok yeah Bryan Fuller, heterosexual male friendship my ass.    That was Guillermo Del Toro level creature horror, especially when it was getting birthed.    I loved the last scene... Will instinctively knowing that Hannibal was still in the church. Seeking him out down below and ultimately forgiving him.   Also, the way Will said buon notte (and then faded into the shadows) made a serious shiver go through my spine.    Inspector Pazzi, you should really listen to Will. He good at predicting these things. RIP.    *"This is the only place I could make for you."*  RIP, Abigail. Welcome, Head!Abigail.   Can we take a moment to discuss that Guillermo Del Toro level horror creature? Half Wendigo Half Man Half Demon.    Dear Bryan Fuller, thank you so very deeply for making us relive our past traumas and broken hearts.   We're going to eat you... slowly.    With love,  Fannibals.    Did anyone else notice NBC blurring out the nether regions of a 500 year old painting tonight? But not the murdered, skinned, decapitated, twisted, and chopped up human remains.    The way Will said buon notte (and then faded into the shadows) made a serious shiver go through my spine.    This surgery autopsy scene is really disturbing.    *"This is the only place I could make for you."*   Yup, she's dead. Head!Abigail.    Egad Hannibal was creeping!!   *"This is the only place I could make for you."*   Yup, she's dead. Head!Abigail.    *"This is the only place I could make for you."*   Yup, she's dead. Head!Abigail.    *"I do feel closer to Hannibal here. God only knows where I would be without him. He left us his broken heart. He knew we could come."*   Ok yeah Bryan Fuller heterosexual male friendship my ass... this is def post breakup angst.    Ok this is thoroughly horrifying. WTF is this manwendigodemon creature?   *Valentine written on a broken man.*   Oh come on no pendulum??    Is it just me or is NBC blurring out the nether regions of a 500 year old painting?    My prediction: Will will "kill" her in his mind for the third, thus finally accepting that his and Hannibal's relationship is over and he will put Hannibal away.    *"We are not making television. We are making a pretentious art film from the 80s."* - Bryan Fuller    Young Hannibal be looking swank.    The dude did not greet or acknowledge Abigail at all. Definitely Head!Abigail.    I think we're seeing Head!Abigail right now :(    She still hasn't interacted with anyone who isn't Will. It's Head!Abigail.    I still think she's dead.   There's an interview where Bryan Fuller said the network basically had issue with a bare buttock being shown on screen (because omg nudity). But apparently they were ok with it as long as it was covered in blood and you couldn't actually tell it was a nude butt. O.o Welcome to Murica.    I was just getting coming to acceptance with that. :( Now we're reliving it.    GODDAMNIT. WHAT IS THIS COMMERCIAL BREAK?   My theory is that she invited Anthony (Tom Wisdom) to Florence just wanted to see how Hannibal would react/what would happen when he was uncovered as an imposter.    LOL love it.    This is adorable.    Is it bad that now I'm super stoked for a super risque and probably disturbing sex scene?   Thanks for sharing that!    I think it was for that last line about Hannibal being lonely and wishing it was Will Graham dining with him. It further helps the viewer understand how much Hannibal wanted Will's friendship and how much it cut him when he was betrayed. It also leads up to the Hannibal broken heart scene at the very end of the episode.    Ugh that would be absolutely morbid. I suppose I would still eat it as long as he was going to let me go after dinner... and not slowly chop me up and eat me like Gideon.    Yeah he's so smug with Gideon all the time. Calling him an animal, eating him, feeding him to himself, and basically all around tormenting him with the fact that he's going to kill him slowly and horribly... and then Gideon turns it all around on Hannibal with one line. And Hannibal's just like goddamnit.    I mean - intellectually, it's just meat right?     The look she gives Hannibal and then the smug look Hannibal gives her back.    He thought the two of them could become friends or co-conspirators or something, but little did he know that Hannibal is still suffering from a broken heart from the last friendship he tried to create.    It's one of my favorite parts of the show. There's such a polished film quality to this show and especially this episode with parts shot in 2.35:1.    The opening scenes were insanely well shot, especially considering low light conditions and moving bike. I knew we were going to be for a good one from the beginning.    Agreed!   I hadn't planned on it, but if there's enough interest - definitely!    First off, happy cake day!   And yes, completely agree on the food! The show always makes me so hungry, tonight's episode in particular.    I'm huge television junkie and I consider Hannibal to be the best show on air right now.   I also basically just did a detailed rewatch of this episode while taking these screenshots. So many more beautiful scenes, but even after I trimmed it down I had so many images.    The art, direction and cinematography on this show is first class. The European setting really adds another layer to the atmosphere of the show - heavy, ornate, and so perfectly Hannibal.    I am here to deliver: http://www.reddit.com/r/HannibalTV/comments/38mn24/hannibal_s03e01_art_direction_cinematography_in/      In no particular order:   * Fantastic acting   casting, particularly for Mads Mikkelsen as Hannibal and Hugh Dancy as Will  * Beautiful cinematography * Amazing art direction (and creativity around the murder tableaus) * Best sound and music I've heard on a TV show ever - eerie and atmospheric * Dark, gothic sets and costumes (especially the color palettes)  * Bryan Fuller * Well written and well paced  Also because:   * The exploration of the friendship between Hannibal and Will  * The exploration of the pathological psyche of Will Graham and the killers he pursues  * It's not afraid to push the boundaries of art, graphic violence, and dark stories on network television    *"Oysters, acorns, and masala... It's what ancient Romans would feed their livestock to improve their flavor."*   That moment when Bedelia realizes why Hannibal's feeding her what he's feeding her.       Wow...    Especially the part when he burns Hannibal with one limb left.   *"If only that company could be Will Graham."*   All I have to say is... such a shame it wasn't that kind of party.    Did anyone find the flashback scenes with Abel Gideon really really morbid? An awful cannibal, limb hacking countdown to death.    Put something on that wicked BURN. Abel Gideon calling Hannibal out with only one limb left.   Doesn't poor lonely Hannibal wish he could be dining with Will Graham?    I think it's great that the two of them are on shows back to back with each other right now. Plus they're returning for X-files soon.   	124
 I corrected the I;m to I'm  so now everyone should be be on the same page :)   I fessed up when I went in for cigs today and she said "no beer tonight?" in hindsight I should have stocked up on more booze so it wasn't suspicious. she acted like she was cool with it, but I could tell she was hurt   it was after midnight and i was more than a few beers deep but didn't have any more in the house. so i went to the only store open, I'm sorry. i didn't mean to cheat on you but you were closed. i still love you and value our relationship. i made a mistake and hate myself for it, but lets just move on ok honey   congrats man. i'm saving up for a dualsport because i'm right at where you were on my fourth steel reserve tallboy right now.

 You douching?    Or comments.     6 or 7   I used to run distance in some hot areas, like Guam and Singapore. During long runs (typically anything over 45 min) I'd have to consume salt packets to keep my muscles from seizing up.  They have 'sport gels' for this now, but salt is basically what you need.   I concur.    looks pretty ~~cozy~~ douchy.  FIFY   It's 2015 - gay jokes just aren't cool.  [edit] Unless you're referring to Hawaiian's. Is that the case?    I don't get it. Is that a gay joke?   Just a bit. It's just such a douchy look. I see all these hipsters rocking their wool caps over here in Brooklyn and it's like mid 80's and humid. Uuugh. And they SMELL.   "for pages"  Hope it's not an English test.   Someone else in the photo is wearing shorts and a sleeveless shirt. Short sleeves. Sleeveless. I bet the girl sitting down is wearing shorts.   No, I'm not.   www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyl5H5a09f0   Seriously, it's not like that's even a good beer, it's made by Inbev and it's very basic.   Yea, I've tried wool caps. They and their effects on your hair aren't a big secret. People who wear them during the hot summer are tool bags; evident in the image of a man needing help from a group of lesbians to muster some hope of success on Tinder.   Oh it's summer? Why don't you wear your wool cap and a hoodie.  I hope this guy never gets laid, ever.   Nah, ginger is naturally soothing to the stomach.  It's actually used as a natural treatment for acid reflux.    A bit longer than 15 minutes but "The Situation."  He's going on about building his brand up when now it's a brand that no one can sell. Clubs in NYC won't even put him on the guest list b/c it's so synonymous with douchbaggery. And the clincher is that the IRS is into him hard now. If he'll avoid jail time he'll have to pay out until he's in the poor house. Good for him.   I've know NattyFat too! She's such a health expert. And since everything the eats is healthy, the more she eats, the healthier she becomes! Duh, it's SO LOGICAL.  I dropped this story into rant wednesday on rFitness; but she lurks in my works kitchen too.  When I make peanut PB J she'll let me know that almond butter is much healthier and ask why I'm loading up on the protein.   If that were my Goat server, he wouldn't be getting a good tip.   This totally makes sense. It's just a very very specific bit of wisdom.    I don't mind girls in tattoos but a bad tattoo's really bother me.   Horny, then lonely. Than bored enough to finally look for love. The internet *is* beautiful.     All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth ~ ()   I think it was more for the knots.   You can use less salt.   Rabble rabble rabble.      Yeah but she owns it.         "Nobody not lying about anything"  Does this mean he's lying about anything?    Is it food? Do you have free will? Don't come to me with your silly questions.   OMG you're right! I've had that at a bunch spot. Admittedly I was skeptical but damn was it good.  	34
 I've always wanted an M3, but I'll never get one unless I snag the lottery. I got kids to feed!    That it's pro-American. But it's their right don't you think? Do you think an American newspaper could or should stand against the power and strength of the United States?  WTF are you talking about? Seriously. See my other comment. It's not my subjective opinion. Read the articles, look at who the authors are. Look at what they cover, and what they don't.  [They admit it themselves that they are liberal](http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sheppard/2013/08/18/new-york-times-public-editor-admits-paper-has-liberal-bias)  And they only talk about Rove in the Opinion section - which btw they aren't always favorable to him. MSNBC is left of NYT is left of CNN is left of WSJ is left of FOX.    The New York Times is considered liberal by people who call New York City "Jew York City"  wtf? ALL of my conservative friends say it's left leaning by a wide margin, and never once have I heard 'Jew York City". You seem pretty ignorant.   And any objective person will see NYT is liberal. So you are telling me delusional liberals want to think liberal sources are not liberal? That's cool, but they are still delusional.   I mean, for crying out loud, one of their biggest contributers is Krugman, who is a HUGE liberal, not to mention all the anti-Israel positions they take on a consistent basis.  [A New York Times editor admitted they are a liberal newspaper](http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sheppard/2013/08/18/new-york-times-public-editor-admits-paper-has-liberal-bias)  Honestly it would be like saying Fox is a moderate news station. Anyone who thinks that is clearly biased and blind themselves. It's not as in-your-face liberal as MSNBC or HuffPo, but it certainly is liberal.    New York Times stands for the power and strength of the United States around the world  what are you saying? It's widely considered a left-leaning newspaper, just link WSJ is considered right-leaning.   And I didn't say we should outlaw anything. I said that this sub-reddit has more of these left leaning sources than moderate or right-leaning sources. I never said we should 'outlaw them'   WP? Can't think of what that is. /r/politics is widely liberal, and most sources are left-leaning or completely Left sources. Vox, HuffPo, AJ, DailyBeast, NYT, Slate, and more. Oh WP - Washington Post. It's not liberal only, but it is surely liberal-leaning. Not as massively as HuffPo or something, but certainly liberal biased.    After going through this sub, you would think bernie would be higher    no doctor should fear for their lives for providing such services, nor should any women fear for her safety while seeking out such services  Um does that happen?   I should have clarified - it would be nice to see said sources on /r/politics, instead of seeing liberal-only sources on the front page.    Would be nice to have an anti-Walker from sources that aren't heavily liberal.    I'm not sure why he can't win the primary. His message should appeal to all the minorities and lower class. Does the lower class tend to now vote in primaries?   I would have to agree with that one...   Ha no problem. I didn't even notice your username. By the way the 'Join us on Slack' link produces an application error. Not sure if that is an issue with you or with slack.   www.Scotch.io has some really helpful articles. I went there for info on Sublime. They have some great tutorials.   So what about resale values of these manuals?   Let's say for example that 2015 is the last year any BMW has manual. That means used 2015 models (and earlier ones) with manual transmission will have a much higher resale value.    One ting to note is that the resell value for used manual transmission cars will go up. Lets say 2016 is the last year that the BMW M3 comes in manual. That probably means the 2016 M3 will have great resell value - so will the 2015.   I think the problem is when you have years of no austerity, and then too much austerity. When it gets to this point, there isn't much you can do.         Yup. I'm surprised my net karma on /r/politics is actually positive.   By your logic, no one receives welfare, ever. I'm not getting welfare, its going to the corporations where I buy my groceries. I'm not getting welfare, its going to the corporation where I buy my gas... Etc.  It's pretty shitty logic. However yes, the value of the building doesn't matter if he is renting one of many units.   Many countries themselves ignore many UN rulings. They are hardly a binding force. But I don't really care what some body says. If it's illogical, its illogical. If it's stupid, its stupid. Doesn't make a difference who says it.   So... "because the UN said so" is your answer.   Got it.   Basic human right? Your employer does not owe you shit. Should they do it? Sure, but calling it a 'basic human right' is just stupid.   You can probably find good reason to ban the flag of any country, as any country has probably committed some atrocity at some point in the past.    How about the American flag itself? That should be next.   Ya I saw the manga and that makes a lot more sense. Thanks for the info about the music. Had no idea. Even though the original dub is guilty of terrible dialogue doesn't mean kai isn't bad. It's just *not as bad*.    Killing the pride of Vegeta would be kind of ruining a character.  I'm not saying kill it. I'm saying tone it down. Even for his level of pride, it's a bit over the top. It's like, "in case you didn't understand Vegeta's character, here is another example..." over and over again   1. Not crazy about Gohan's voice in Kai. Just an opinion.  2. The music played during Cell's death was just normal music. It was such a letdown. In the original version, there was [this music](https://youtu.be/Ec6fR11dHUk?t=172), which I believe, is not used anywhere else. Hence, it's 'special music' used for cell's death. In Kai, the music used is plain music used throughout DBZ, including times when enemies simply stared at each other.  3. Goku and Gohan could have easily trained in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, **and gotten sufficient rest**. They had 9 days. So 4 days rest, 1 day in the chamber, and 4 days rest again. So the idea that Goku 'wanted to rest' doesn't really make sense. Then again, he knew Gohan was more than strong enough at that point, so maybe that's why he said that.  4. **Goku had plenty of time to use instant transmission to drop cell off, and return back to earth.** [There is PLENTY of time here](https://youtu.be/JMVTlYExFkY?t=117). That always bothered me. I mean he didn't even try.  5. The dialogues at times, are absolutely the most corny/forced/lame dialogue I've ever seen on television. The dialogue between villians and heroes, is just awful most of the time. It almost feels like that's how people would talk if they were making fun of action movies. It's just so forced and corny.   6. I understand Vegeta's character, and I like it a lot, but they go way to far in showing his pride. We get it. The "I'm the Prince of all Saiyins and I'm going to kill you haha" is so repeated that it just gets downright stupid. It would have been better if it was more subtle and less in your face. I think he character is much better in the Buu Saga.  7. Piccolo being stronger than a Super Saiyin Vegeta pissed me off. He's a Namekian for crying out loud.   8. The Z fighters again succumbing to 'Solar Flare'. How do you not close your eyes, it's pretty obvious when he's about to do it, but somehow it gets everyone for the second time.  9. The closing theme song is one of the most painful songs I have ever heard in a long time  10. I am pretty sure I heard Yamcha say "Fuck me" when Goku gave Cell a sensu bean. That was pretty awesome. If you couldn't tell, I watched the Android/Cell saga.    What about English sub? I can live without the dub. Rather watch it earlier with sub   Really? Are you sure, because I don't if that's the case. I couldn't find a video of someone doing it.   Top 5 posts on /r/politics are all Sanders. This is getting a bit annoying. Take it to /r/sandersforpresident   A new fantastic place to go   An overly simplistic analysis.   So I got a small crack on my glass recently. Has anyone had any success in replacing just the glass, and **not** the screen?   Also any links to glass repair kits would be great.   Samsung you tard.    America is getting worse. Anti religious sentiment is growing daily. One day they will prosecute us, in the name of 'morality'.   Think they will stay silent about our 'barbaric tradition' of circumcision? Think they will let use keep our shuls tax-free? Think non-Jews will be happy to let us keep taking time off for Jewish holidays? Science and evolution? Homosexuals? Judaism is the antithesis of where this country is headed. It won't happen suddenly, but over time you will see.    I don't.  Would you 'handle' a monkey shouting at you? No. You would ignore it. What's the point of telling a monkey to stop shouting? It won't stop unless it wants to, and it won't listen to you.   Super Kami Guru Super Saiyan God Super Saiyain 2 Plus   Lol I thought this was /r/tennis for a second. Was very confused on how you played tennis in your basement.   100 years from now we won't be worrying about climate change. We will have figured out how to use something other than fossil fuels by then. Climate change is a long term hypothetical issue.   Well that makes sense if you spend 20 years on death row - and that's kind of the problem. Takes away from the deterrence if you know you get 20 years and you might never be executed. Either be able to do it in a year - or don't do it at all.  And since we would likely end up killing innocent people, I would say 1 year is a bad idea.   So basically, get rid of it.   So don't take my pregnant wife and baby there?   Makes those hippies take their damn shots. Yes yes yes.   I think part of the death penalty not deterring crime, is that you spend 20 years in trial before you ever get executed. If people got executed within 1 year of their crime, I think things would be a lot different. So in that case, the experiment wasn't done. Then again, we would probably end up killing innocent people, so I'm not sure that would be any better.   It's more expensive to execute them than to feed and house them for 50 years? That seems quite odd.   I think part of the death penalty not deterring crime, is that you spend 20 years in trial before you ever get executed. If people got executed within 1 year of their crime, I think things would be a lot different.   I'd throw those on the sidewalk   This conversation is so unbelievably hypothetical that it is borderline retarded.    free hugs   Are the silos accessible? Or did you have to take this from far away, and zoomed in? I was thinking of going there myself.   What are you talking about? I've been able to by many penny stocks like VNRGW and LIQD   This is pretty awesome actually. I hope it gets bigger.   Isn't Android Studio = Intellij?   That's awesome. May this be encouragement to others (and myself)!   Ok thanks, I had a feeling that was true   Someone else made that same point - kind of valid, although this would just be another example of getting tax breaks for having children. That is something we do in this country. So if you don't have kids, you don't get the same luxury of being able to get some of your property tax money back.   [Robinhood sells IPOs as soon as 'they are available to the public'](https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/204329909-How-does-Robinhood-handle-IPOs-)  I also read [This guy seemed to only be able to buy Shake Shack at $50, 100% higher than the open price](https://medium.com/@welovejeff/my-first-two-months-trading-stocks-with-robinhood-9580af92532c)  It seems the stock will be available, but it might be too late.    I always seem to miss all the good IPOs. I read today that Ebay and Paypal are splitting up, and Paypal will be a newly listed company on July 20th. I read that [here](https://www.internetretailer.com/2015/06/29/ebaypaypal-divorce-date-set)  So I only use Robinhood to do my trading. Are there limits around IPOs? Will I even be able to purchase stock in the first hour? I've read that sometimes you have to go through brokers to get stock initially.   Has anyone had an experience getting in on an IPO using Robinhood.  **Note: I am not asking if my stock pick is good or bad, so no posting with "That's a terrible idea..."**    what's to stop the people who don't have kids from saying they shouldn't have to pay for public schools too?  Good point! Only good point I've heard so far in agreement with the ruling.   I guess the point also is if you have kids you *have* to have a larger house, hence higher property taxes. Also, we have many cases where we give tax benefits for having children, so this could be another benefit.    Religious institutions are welcome to proselytize but not on my dime  It's not on your dime actually. By not sending their children to public schools, they save the public school system money. For my school system for example, it's around $7,000. If you give familes $4,000 for sending their kid to public school, *you have saved $3,000*.   The simple truth is that it's about money, and nothing else. The state/cities get more money if they refuse to have a voucher system. In terms of cost to the taxpayer, I will rank it for you.  **From highest cost to taxpayer, to lowest cost to taxpayer:**  1. Child goes to public school (est. cost = $8,000) 2. Child goes to private school, with a voucher (est. cost = $0 to $6,000, depending on voucher) 3. Child goes to private school, with no voucher (cost = $0)  The best option for the taxpayer is to have kids go to private schools without vouchers. This is the sole reasoning here. Nothing else. However that is slightly negated - if vouchers were given, *more students would go to private school, thus lowering the cost to the taxpayer*.  Btw even private religious schools must uphold a certain level of secular academic studies, comparable to most public schools.   Kind of bullshit. You pay thousands and property tax. That tax goes to pay for public school. Then you don't even send your kid to public school - which saves the school money. Shouldn't you get back at least *some* of that money? If the cost to the school system to have a child is $8,000 per child - I think it's more than fair to give $4,000 back to the family.   But to be honest these judges don't really care about the constitution anymore. If they want something, they rule accordingly. In this case, they want money from these parents, so the ruled it unconstitutional.   Why is Janemba in there?   Wow that couldn't have been more vague.    Not sure why you got down voted, I think this is a more than plausible theory   which view of his don't you agree with?   cool   I really hope that those who vote in the primaries will have the brains to eliminate Ted Cruz and anyone like him.   I'm a bit confused on the purpose of XAMPP for better PHP development. Currently, what I do to test my PHP locally is use this command:      php -S localhost:8888  In the same folder that has my index.php file. I then use the browser and go to 'localhost', and it seems to work fine, my page shows up.  So how would using XAMPP be any better/different? I guess I'm not clear on how I'm supposed to be using it in the first place.  my second questions is about http://www.w3fools.com/. I saw on a wiki here that w3schools is a bad resource. I've never heard that before. Was w3fools made a long time ago? Does it still apply?   The only thing worse than a Republican is a DINO      Umm, and? Newspapers are for-profit entities. There is an owner, or share of owners that the profit goes to. Religious institutions don't have the concept of profit. In most cases, churches/syngagogues actually are in debt, and can't always make ends meet. I know most synagogues around me have large mortgages, and all their donations simply goes to cover the costs of running.   I'm not sure how in anyway way that compares to a for-profit organization.   A church does not profit. So what exactly would you tax?   I thought she might be scum, but now I know.

EDIT: More info - To clarify, the car is in park - but the computer thinks the car is in Neutral.  This happened while I was driving. I was driving, and then all of a sudden the traction control light went on, and I couldn't accelerate. Hitting the gas pedal would rev the car, but it wouldn't move. I turned off the car, and tried to turn it back on, and it wouldn't turn on. No clicking or anything. Seems like an electronic problem, and Ford will fix it in the morning (it's a lease)   I bet they were just drunk and rude, and the fact that they were holding hands was completely irrelevant.

 I agree that the headline is misleading. I also agree with your proposal.      Congrats--your weight loss is definitely noticeable! Great job!   Fantastic! Congratulations, you are an inspiration! I need to study the keto board but just wondering what your goals are--you say 20 g of carbs on a 2000 cal/day diet. So those carbs are in the form of veggies, and the other 1900 cals are in the form of protein and fat? Do you have a goal for how many grams of each?   This is a great idea. I'm going to try it.   Congratulations, I'm almost at my first five lost. While it's great to hear the inspirational stories of people who have lost 100+ pounds, to me as a newbie, seeing a post about reaching those early milestones is really helpful.   What an accomplishment! Congratulations!   That's great! I've got a bunch of "thin" or at least "thinner" clothes I'd love to be able to fit into!      I agree completely. I think there was a power struggle between conservative and liberal mods, and somehow the conservatives managed to ban several liberal-leaning publications with the very shaky rationales you cite.            That is great, congratulations!   Gosh, that is great! Congratulations!      Agree.                     Fantastic! Congratulations, and thanks for sharing your story.               Fantastic!      Very impressive -- congratulations!   Yay! congratulations! I've yet to reach my first 5 and can't wait for those lairs!   Congratulations! I can't wait to add that -5 flair!   Congratulations, you handled things so well! And you are right, emotional eating makes you feel good for about 30 seconds and bad all day and then some. I admire the way you are coping-hang in there!   Can you buy your lunch at school and get at least one healthy meal there?   What Knutes said. Congratulations, you should be so proud of all you've accomplished and continue to accomplish, and thank you so much for taking the time to share and inspire us all!   Agree -always cute but now add the heat!   Thank you so much for your reply. It's very helpful. The issue of sleep is especially interesting. I've always been a night owl and now at age 60 it's gotten pretty dysfunctional -- I'm usually sleep-deprived. I've read that regular sleep habits, and adequate sleep, are important to dieting, but changing my sleep habits has been difficult. If I go to bed early I just wake up every 90 minutes. I think I'm going to need to tire myself out with more exercise and then walk bedtime back gradually.  Also glad to hear that diet is 80% of the weight-loss equation because I've let my diet plan get derailed on days I can't exercise, like "why bother, I can't get on the treadmill today so I've already blown it."  Lastly, glad to hear your endorsement of MFP and low-carb. I've tried weight watchers online  but I don't think it's a good fit for me because I like to get the calorie and nutritional info. I think calorie counting is a better fit for me. I like carbs so I'm going to need to watch them.  I'm trying to do a serious diet and lose 50 pounds. I'm 5'6" and 200, got up there gradually over the years, topped out at 211 six years ago, have made half-hearted and inconsistent efforts since then. My weight as a young person was low 120s  but I'd be happy with 150 as a goal for now.  Thank you again for your response -- you are very kind and a great example!

Great way to support your local library.   @purplepooters -- I am a librarian. i work with these systems.   @fucktheecrunch -- At most libraries it's possible for patrons to establish accounts with a login and password beyond their library card number. Patrons can use those accounts to compile booklists of items they'd like to read, to do an interlibrary loan or a hold request electronically, etc. I don't think those accounts would be likely to retain a title after the book was checkout out, but perhaps in some systems they can. Since the patron controls the login, privacy would be maintained, I suppose.    @EuropeanLady -- Yes, that is an unfortunate result of the privacy policy. It seems to me to be the lesser of two evils. Patrons can always keep their own lists of items borrowed, or save the date due reminder slips most libraries print out, which have the titles of the books on them.    @pedrobeara-- if what you are saying is true, your wife is in violation of her professional code of ethics -- I assume she has an MLS?   @Razed -- The circ systems and their servers are pretty secure, contained closed systems. Like an intranet, really.   @fuck_theecrunch -- Not true. I'm a librarian, and every library system I've had experience with automatically deletes the patron's information when the borrowed material is returned. There is no way to retrieve that information. There is no list of what people check out that individual librarians can use or disable. You say that some libraries can override this system and keep the records, but deletion is always the default setup and I've never encountered a library that overrode that.    @Jaydea -- Yes, libraries had to deal with this stuff back in the McCarthy era, and in the 60s as well. The patron privacy policy is longstanding.    @jonnypadams -- In many libraries, you can get Netflix-style recommendations based on your search of the catalogue. It does not depend on what you check out, but what you search for (with no record kept).Try it sometime.    @purplepooters -- Library systems are designed to delete once and for all. They have dedicated servers and tight networks.    @pedrobeara -- Do you work at a library? I do, and you are lying.   @That's the whole point of the articles. Identifying info is deleted from the computers when the materials are returned.    @imadetheinternet -- Why would they take your computers? it was about civil liberties. If you were a librarian, you should be familiar with the Library Code of Ethics: http://www.ala.org/advocacy/proethics/codeofethics/codeethics   @fleker2 -- A good librarian can make suggestions based on the preferences you tell her, and many library catalogues have suggested books based on your catalog searches (not your check-outs, just the kind of stuff you are searching for, with no record kept of your search).    @dagobahh -- I think those cards just had the dates stamped on it if it was a public library. Most "sign-out" library slips were used at elementary school libraries.    @rundmcarlson -- Yes, the terrorists are all flocking to the library. They all have cards.    @Comeonyouidiots -- You can check out library ebooks from home and read them on your computer or mobile device, instead of contributing to Jeff Bezos. You can also access various proprietary research tools and databases from home, also on that little old computer you seem so proud of.    @big_giant_turd -- Public computers at a library are scrubbed nightly.   @Col Volkov -- Libraries are funded mostly by local property taxes with maybe a very occasional federal grant. Library policy dictates that when materials are returned, the identity of the borrower is deleted.   Your fun facts are lies.   @toychristoper -- Stop spreading misinformation. Records are deleted to protect patrons' privacy, NOT to save server space. Where do you get that? It is completely untrue.    @Tidec -- You can get the same info from a survey. Also, libraries keep records of the number of times items are checked out, just not who checks them out, so you could draw some conclusions by comparing the checkout rates of various items with the publicly available census info on the demographics of the community, or before and after a historical event, etc. A historian can do plenty of research with conventional historical methods, without prying into the identities, incomes, etc., of library users. An actual historian would know that.   @UltraeVires -- Actually the government was quite interested in a  lot of innocent people in the McCarthy era, and the Snowden revelations show that they still have quite an interest in collecting info on people who turn out not to be threats in any way.    @GannamStylingOnYou -- Unless you're thinking of the stamp with names that appears inside the cover of many school textbooks, if that's really the case, your library was violating the professional ethics of the profession. Way back in the day there used to be slips with due dates, but I've never heard of one with names.    @aleister -- Donate to your local library's Friends of the Library group, or buy some treats to send over to your local library's staff as a thank you!    @toychristopher --No, you are wrong. Records are destroyed to protect library users' privacy. I am a librarian.   Great job! Now you're paying it forward by inspiring me!      Congratulations, you are doing a tremendous job --you're an inspiration!   @dinosaurdinosrawr -- Thank you!            Trying to finally get serious and lose weight. I'm a 5'6" 60-year-old female who has been gradually gaining weight from my late 30s onward, finally getting into the 200s in the past ten years or so, topped out at 211 about eight years ago, now 201. I'd be thrilled if I could get to 150.   My goals are to count calories every day with MFP and to get exercise daily. Do people set number goals, in terms of pounds lost per month?   That is so impressive! Congratulations!      Gosh, you look fantastic! Congratulations! You inspire me!         @Pudums -- No, no, you didn't come off that way. Invisibility is an issue you don't really think about until you experience it. The male gaze can be objectifying rather than flattering but it's something we become accustomed to and we notice when it's lacking. And there is nothing wrong with enjoying the fact that you're visible again!   Ok, I'm new here, have lost about five pounds through half-assed off and on efforts in the past couple of months. This may be what I need to get me going. Thanks.      @niamhd--Really nice post.    Glad to see your post, and all the comments in response. My weight gain has been gradual over the past 10 years or so, and coincides with my going from 50 to 60 years old. I know I'm invisible, figured it was a combo of the weight and the aging. I'm actually happy to see it's not all just paranoia in my head and is an actual thing!   Congrats on your progress!   Congratulations -- I long to be where you are!!!      This is fantastic advice. Thank you.   Maybe start with $5 then?   I agree with allieneeds oats above. You are 22 and working. Can you ask your mom if you can keep out even $10 per week to buy yourself some veggies etc?    Agree--you are young and your skin is still very elastic. I don't think your goal--40 lbs on a 6'5" frame -- will make your skin saggy.                  Congrats on the weight loss. Re your question: from your photo, you look young. In my opinion, weight loss comes faster when you're young. Since I've gotten older I've found it is slower going. Now there's some motivation to keep those pounds off! Great job.      Congrats!!!         @Bartleby1955 -- Obviously it's worse, or it wouldn't be noteworthy. Here are the NFL's figures, quoted in the New York Times:  "The N.F.L.s actuaries assumed that 28 percent of all players would be found to have one of the compensable diseases and that the league would pay out $900 million to them. Their calculations showed that players younger than 50 had an 0.8 percent chance of developing Alzheimers or dementia, compared with less than 0.1 percent for the general population. For players ages 50 to 54, the rate was 1.4 percent, compared with less than 0.1 percent for the general population. The gap between the players and the general population grows wider with increasing age."   @ghost27 -- I think that is great advice. I've been derailed so many times by my compulsive perfectionism, trying to eat only diet food and exercise every single day right from the start. I've recently come to realize that the all-or-nothing approach is sabotaging me.            @Phredex -- http://www.salon.com/2014/09/12/its_disgusting_and_its_still_about_race_southern_republicans_simply_dont_want_minorities_to_vote/                     The r/politics mods removed my previous post on this, which was from TPM. Let's see what they do with this one.                                          @SayYouDo-- A trained professional police officer should do a better job of handling a crowd than "most people."    @AndroidHelp--That is how the word appeared in the original headline and it is r\Politics First Commandment that headlines must not be altered.               @ThomasJefferdaughter -- It is about politics in that it is relevant to the discussion of how the political process should deal with institutional racism and the militarization of local police force.   	136
 It is a realistic problem for everyone. Hopefully we can all realize it.    I'm sorry to know this. But I hope you can realize your dream soon.    You are so lucky to have this happy life. I believe that this is the dream of all people but very few of them can realize this dream. So you are lucky!   And people's mutual understanding will lead to the solutions of war, famine and other damages. In fact, if people can think more for others, it is not hard to realize this dream.    It's a pretty cool dream!    It's a beautiful dream and good luck to you.    One may have different dreams in different aspects and you must have the one that you really want to realize. What's that dream in your mind?       People seem to be crazy about this. But the one who is successfully picked by the director will be the luckiest one!   Amazing!! I would like to have the same design in my apartment!!   It may seem crazy but I have to say I'm willing to have the same kind of life! It's for freedom!   Oh! Sometimes not very tall can be very active and agility. :)   Haha, it's a little bit annoying.   So many friends of mine love this movie, too. they all think it excellent!   Why? I think word of mouth is the best way for a thing to be accepted by people.   	15

 Again. You guys rock, or flower. Whatever it is you do here in r/gardening you do it well my friends. I hope to one day be the redditor here giving advice. Your support it awesome.      I have no speakers. I saw no fight.    Thanks :)      Heres my take: His age. Seen a few wars. His profession, police officer, big bet he had taken place in one of wars. Small, local town has a VFW. Guy probably spends lots of time there with other cops/vets. Doesnt want to end up as a picture on the wall there.   (edit: VFW are members only, must have served in combat (not just in the military so its like a little club for specific veterans. most old timers that are eligible join the club. its a good organization that takes care of prior and current military members that have served in combat zones)  -or-  The VFW building is adjacent to his cars. If he gets shot "hell end up on the wall at the VFW" as in maybe blood/ body parts, and crap. Thats a stretch though. Go with first   i bet youre real fun at parties   My dog. So we'll behaved and loyal when I'm around. I'm gone for a minute and he's tearing the god dawn house apart    This perfectly sums up the military, Just a big Dog and Pony show.   Lol   I like the mugshots of the cops. Its that classic look, the "I'm fucked" look. I'm sure theyve seen it plenty of times while conducting their dubious duties! To protect and serve, well now its your time to really serve shit bags!   correct. can confirm statement. u/cali_gunner is an absolute idiot    local newspaper reports story. Redditor mocks their attempt, then goes on to bitch about mainstream media.      So their's like air and theres helium. and they like displace at a different rate. so the helium comes out at a different pitch compared to reg air. And thats the jist of it.   to stop them? Rangers, Game Wardens, etc. If they do kill them without tags then they are poachers.  Im not to sure about how tags work, (ie if you can sell/trade them) but technically someone having multiple tags wouldnt be an issue if they were all legal tags. The same number of animals would be taken, and the same left to reproduce. The issue with poachers is that they are killing outside of that predetermined range of animals that can be killed without affecting the population. Hope that makes since princess glitter titties  	16
    well these 45 upvotes seem to say otherwise   i got the Red 9 and Winchester off of some guy who tried to rush me in a police station   How good is farming atm?   The Model 70 is extremely accurate and i haven't had the chance to test the Red 9 yet.   So I have brown-level hunger and after searching through 3 rather large cities/towns and not finding any food, i decided to search for apples. 15 minutes later and 20 apples eaten my hunger has not gone down at all. They either need to make apples better or raise the chance of finding apples. (its also weird that you can see apples on the trees yet somehow dont find any)  If you are going to have nature be the only way to find food, make it common.  After running around the countryside for a few hours i had only spotted 1 animal, a moose. however, as soon as i saw it (about 200m away) it bolted away from me making it impossible to hunt.   where did you find the hunting scope   go inland   go inland, there is plenty of loot inland   Do you know where the scope spawns? i want to put it on my Model 70   duct tape and a little elbow grease      Will this map be ported over to standalone once the renderer and mod tools are released    (Based on group activity)  Phase 1 Jordan, James, Sly, Dan, Ze, Sp00n, Seamus  Phase 2 Jordan, James, Aleks, Dan, Kevin, Dex (Seamus?)  Now we wait for what Phase 3 of The Creatures will be.   dont try and shoot right after running   games been out for a year, you haven't waited for years   id be willing to bet that the one unlocked after the campaign is the Chicago one we've been hearing about.   What kind of setting is Laboratory rumored to be in?   So i haven't seen anybody talk about this, so ill take the initiative and do so.   http://i.imgur.com/ohFafpm.jpg  From this we can gather that a map (or maybe just the trailer) is set in an old-style house/indoors. We know Samantha is in control so we can assume its during ww2/a little later.   cant wait for release   The number 621 and variations of it appear many times during the BO3 "Ember" teaser. I probably missed many times it appears, but here are the ones ive noticed. At 0:59 the time of the newscast 6:21, 1:10 the Olympic running world record 6.21, twice at 1:28- stocks up for 62.10% and for RPRK up 6.21%, at 1:56 bottom left is the time of the newscast 6:21 AM, 2:05 time of newscast 6:21 PM, and during the military scene at the end 2:26 upper right is the time.  Most likely nothing important but something i noticed.   So if i understood correctly, there there were 11 murders, thw puppet, the toy animatronics, golden freddy, and the bonnie Chica and foxy. If this is true, what happenes to the souls of the toy animatronics between fnaf2 and 1    1. Shadow Bonnie and Phantom Freddy are the replacement / temporary suits that employees wear, to Springtrap and Golden Freddy.  2. Purple Guy #1 (http://i.imgur.com/6FU0a95.png) kills The Puppet Child on the street and the 5 children using Golden Freddy at Fredbear's Diner, and later is caught and arrested. (maybe the calls in FNaF2 are pre-recorded)  3. Purple Guy #2 / Night Guard ((http://i.imgur.com/G5vDChg.png) maybe before Jeremy?) does something unknown? to make the spirits hate him.  4. The Puppet controls the Toy Animatronics to kill the night guard in FNaF2.  5. Toy animatronics are scrapped and possessed animatronics are repaired for FNaF1 (presumably The Puppet is also scrapped).  6. The events of FNaF1 take place.  7. After FNaF1 the possessed animatronics are destroyed by Purple Guy #2 and the spirits sp00k him into Springtrap, killing him.  (afterthoughts) If the calls form FNaF2 AREN'T pre-recorded, and the 5 children are killed DURING FNaF2, why are the old animatronics from Fredbear's being possessed?

 Wouldn't that have been successfully dealt with if Obama was Hillary's VP for the last eight years, though?    yea he was. The reason he went along with Oslo is because Oslo was actually engineered while Bush Sr. was in office.  Yeah, I don't really have as much of a problem with Oslo (which, for the record, I think was necessary) as I do with the lack of response to terrorism that came with it and with the increased expectations for peace which in turn might have helped result in the Second Intifada breaking out after the collapse of the Camp David peace talks in 2000.  Bush I was the first president to begin talks with the PLO. Plus, Oslo was popular in Israel back in the early '90s.  Yes; all of this appears to be correct.   If you read "Putting People First," which was the Clinton/Gore campaign book, they were actually against a Palestinian state before they came to office.  Understood; for the record, I don't have a problem with a Palestinian state--in fact, I support such a state because it's better than having Israel rule millions of Palestinians. Rather, I have a problem with the way that the Oslo process was handled.   Also, Clinton treated Netanyahu better than Bush Sr. treated Shamir, or Obama treats Netanyahu, even tho Bibi and Bill weren't as close at Rabin and Bill.  That might be debatable; after all, Obama's actions, as opposed to his words, aren't anti-Israel or even anti-Netanyahu. Indeed, I think that pro-Israel advocates have been too harsh on Obama.  Also, in regards to Netanyahu, didn't Clinton actually send some of his campaign advisers in order to help Ehud Barak's campaign against Netanyahu in 1999? If so, then that's more anti-Netanyahu than anything that Obama has done.  Of course, as a side note, I do think that Netanyahu's stalling in regards to the peace process was more acceptable in the 1990s than it is today. After all, unlike Yasser Arafat, Mahmoud Abbas actually *did* deliver on his promises to stop terrorism (Yes, there is Hamas in Gaza, but Abbas can't do anything about them for obvious logistical reasons).    For all we know Obama would have flamed out during this 8 year period.  Why exactly do you think that, though?          She'd be centrist because she is already fighting history trying to get a 3rd consecutive term for her party.  OK.  Between 1952 and now, 1988 is the only election when that's happened. While in 2000, Al Gore kind of did the same in that he, like Bush Sr. in 1988, got the largest share of the vote, he 1. didn't make it to the White House, and 2, like Bush in 1988, had a smaller margin of victory (winner minus loser) than his predecessor had the cycle before.  Yes, though it is worth noting that we came close to having the same party win the U.S. Presidency 3+ times in a row in 1960, 1968, 1976, and 2000.   One of the other reasons she'll be a centrist is because Obama's faced a lot of problems in Congress because his perceived liberalism caused regional issues. Hillary is going to want less north-south division.  Yes, but is she going to be successful in this regard? After all, isn't she already extremely polarizing?   She also doesn't want to suffer the fate of Bush Sr., who got pushed to the far right on social conservatism by Buchanan, Quayle, and the family values crowd. Hell, in the summer of 1992 (when Perot had left the race), and Bush was still getting owned by Clinton, people wanted him to swap Quayle ("Murphy Brown as a professional woman hurts kids") with Pete Wilson from California. Buchanan's speech at the RNC played a role in the fact they never came close to covering their polling deficit until Perot re-entered and took away change vote.  The thing is, though, that having Hillary be centrist might cause less liberals to go out and vote for her; frankly, I am unsure that she would be able to get enough centrist voters to make up for this vote deficit.   There's a tendency of voters to move against the party/ideology thats been in power for a long time. Anyone notice how badly Ike beat Stevenson? While Ike was no conservative, he was a move away from what was liberalism back in 1952 and 1956.  Yes, but the Democrats won the White House for *five* consecutive terms between 1932 and 1948 and also had to deal with Korea and corruption in 1952. Thus, 1952 probably isn't a good comparison to either 2016 or 2020.   Because they strongly like Western culture? ;)    Also I'm not racist.  Sure you aren't. ;)   If so, though, then why exactly aren't sailors that smart?   What about the seals, though?   I agree with you about the latter but I am uncertain about the former. After all, her husband wasn't exactly that pro-Israel back when he was U.S. President.    where as the town where I grew up you can probably rent a full house for 1000-1200/month so they can have a much lower minimum wage.  Where exactly did you grow up, though?             Regrets: all things Snowden-related,  Wasn't the Patriot Act recently repealed, though?  Wall Street,  Agreed.  no single payer,  Was singer payer ever actually on the table, though?  we're still in the mideast,  Barely; after all, we withdrew from Iraq in 2011.  copyright,  Care to please elaborate on this?  etc.  Care to please elaborate on this?  Personally I feel pretty betrayed.  Understood.    What do you believe would cause Iran to drop its support of Shia proxies in the region?  Regime change in Iran might accomplish this task.  However, don't some of Iran's proxies, such as the Houthis in Yemen, actually have legitimate grievances?   The scene about Biggus Dickus from Monty Python's Life of Brian:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K8_jgiNqUc   OK; if so, then I apologize for asking this.  Also, out of curiosity, how exactly do you think that a Hillary Clinton Presidency (starting from 2017) would be different from Barack Obama's Presidency (in the 2009 to 2017 time period)?   Would this be good enough for you? :  https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/hillarys-war-how-conviction-replaced-skepticism-in-libya-intervention/2011/10/28/gIQAhGS7WM_story.html  "During the initial weeks of unrest in Libya, Clinton was among the White House officials clinging to fading hopes that Gaddafi might fall without any help from the West.  From the first armed resistance on Feb. 18 until March 9, the disorganized opposition movement appeared to be on a roll, taking control of Libyan cities from Benghazi to Brega and Misurata on the Mediterranean coast. But in a single, bloody week, Gaddafi loyalists turned rebel gains into a rout, crushing resistance in towns across Libya before marshaling forces for a final drive against Benghazi, the last opposition stronghold."   Please let me try finding some and then get back to you on this. :)      Understood.  Also, out of curiosity, exactly which U.S. state are you from?   As far as I know, though, then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met Mahmoud Jibril (one of the Libyan rebel political leaders) for the first time in mid-March 2011. Before that meeting with Jibril, I think that Hillary Clinton opposed U.S. military intervention in Libya. Rather, it was only after that meeting that Hillary changed her mind in regards to this and helped convince Obama to militarily intervene in Libya.   So you ended up changing your mind and voting for Obama? Or did you vote for Clinton and then change your mind and began supporting Obama?  Also, why exactly do you think that a Clinton Presidency (starting from 2017) will be "centrist"? After all, if anything, I think that Clinton will want to continue Obama's legacy.      Yeah, I also think that, short of perhaps a partition of South Tyrol, the status quo is probably the best option for South Tyrol. After all, South Tyrol already has many ethnic Italians living there, especially in large cities such as Bolzano.   Why the heck would have Obama told Gaddafi to step down if he thought that Gaddafi was winning, though? After all, it would be utterly idiotic to damage one's relations with Gaddafi if one thinks that Gaddafi is going to defeat the Libyan rebels.      Gaddafi, not Assad. :)  Anyway, though, apparently the West felt so confident in the Libyan rebels winning that Obama said in late February 2011 that Gaddafi must resign. Do you want me to give you proof of this statement of Obama's?            Because, based on my memories of this, the Libyan rebels were initially successful in February 2011 before Gaddafi's forces began to turn the tide in early March 2011 (or somewhere around there).   Well, at least I still have 21 years to buy some popcorn for this occasion. :)   For me, at least, it would be this:  http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/events/other/10/index.shtml  "On 29 July, the Population Division will release the twenty-fourth round of official United Nations population estimates and projections."  Yes, I absolutely love demographics. :)   As for me, I was too young to vote in 2008, but I supported Barack Obama in the Democratic primaries that year. While Obama has some flaws, I do not regret my support of him in the 2008 Democratic primaries; after all, in my honest opinion, we needed a break from 20 (or 28, if one includes Bush Sr.'s Vice Presidency) continuous years of Bush-Clinton rule. :) Thanks to Obama defeating Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primaries, we indeed got such a break. :)  Anyway, any thoughts on this?   What exactly is this, though?   An extremely hot rock or something along those lines. :(   Oh; OK.  Anyway, I think that Bush could have gotten the U.S. Congress to approve of another war if Iraq would have been a quick success. However, I suspect that a part of the reason that Bush invaded Iraq was because he had a personal grudge against Saddam for trying to kill his dad; thus, Bush might not be sufficiently motivated to invade any other countries even if Iraq ended up being a quick success. After all, simply posturing and making himself appear to be a fighter against "evildoers," as well as pointing to his successes in Afghanistan and Iraq, might have been enough for Bush to win re-election in this TL in 2004.   I am sorry, but what exactly does WOT stand for?   I am curious to hear the personal opinions of South Tyrolese people in regards to this.   Also, in regards to Bush, did his administration actually have such a plan? Or was it mere rhetoric on their part (possibly in order to help helping Bush's 2004 re-election campaign)?    I'm unaware of any attempted annexations on his par  Well, there does appear to be this annexation attempt on Gaddafi's part:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadian%E2%80%93Libyan_conflict  "Gaddafi initially intended to annex the Aouzou Strip, the northernmost part of Chad, which he claimed as part of Libya on the grounds of an unratified treaty of the colonial period.[4]"   The thing is, though, that I am unsure that Bush would have had a "window of opportunity" to do this before the Arab Spring; after all, as far as I know (AFAIK), the Iraqi insurgency was already gaining steam by December 2003 (which is when Gaddafi actually made the final decision to give up his nuclear weapons program and his WMDs).   Thanks for this info. :)  Thus, if France would have turned against Saddam in 2002-2003, do you think that this would have been enough for Saddam to act quickly enough to save his own skin? Or do you think that Saddam would have still gotten overthrown in this scenario?   In order to secure Libya's WMDs and nukes?  Also, by sooner, do you mean sooner in 2011, or even before the Arab Spring broke out (and if so, then when exactly)?   OK; fair enough, I suppose.  Also, out of curiosity, do you think that NATO would have still militarily intervened against Gaddafi in 2011 if he would have kept his WMDs and his nuclear weapons program in 2003 (and later as well)?    Gaddafi on the other hand, as far as I'm aware, didn't have the same desire to be the regional strongman. He wanted to run his country and carry out his own stuff, but wasn't exactly trying to claim himself as a defender of the Arab world (granted he didn't share a border with the eternal enemy like Saddam did). And wasn't as chummy with some of the P5 (since Italy doesn't have a veto) so he would have had more reason to fear the US threats.  Wasn't Gaddafi pretty close with Russia and/or China, though?   Frankly, I don't think that Iran will ever give up its sponsorship and support of its Shiite proxies unless it absolutely has to do this. After all, Iran can project its power both through them and by threatening to violate this nuclear deal and to build nuclear weapons.   Couldn't Gaddafi have quickly conquered Benghazi and then have quickly rebuilt it with his oil money, though?    It's so much more complicated than that... their nuclear program is way down the "what caused Ghaddafi's downfall" list. Internal opposition, sectarian violence, push for reforms, economic instability... there's a long list of bigger factors.  But if Libya would have had missiles which would have been able to carry nuclear weapons or even WMDs in 2011 and which would have been able to hit Britain, France, and/or Italy, then this might have given NATO second thoughts about militarily intervening in favor of the Libyan rebels that year. After all, I don't think that NATO would want to risk having British, French, and/or Italian citizens get killed by Libyan nukes or even by Libyan WMDs.    Ghaddafi envisioned an African Union that is not robbed of its resources by others, that solves their problems internally, that has a bigger political impact and is independant from institutions like the world bank, IMF etc. He also believed in socialist ideas and wanted to establish welfare states in other countries much like his own, which was, according to the UN, much more progressive than most East European countries.  OK.   After the 9/11 attacks Ghaddafi actually wanted to join the war on terror and reached out, he thought he could get international support to get rid of a problem that has been plaguing him ever since, a minority of jihadists in his own country that were constantly interfering with his rule and did not agree with his ideas.  Didn't U.S.-Iran relations also improve during the War on Terror and before Bush's Axis of Evil speech, though?   Unfortunately he was perceived as a supporter of terrorsim because he was still being hold responsible for the Lockerbie bombing(while it is well known that it was Iran) and other terrorist activities in the 70s and 80s.  OK; that said, though, why exactly do you think that Iran is to blame for the Lockerbie bombing?   Also the strategy of the US immediately after 9/11 was to invade several North African countries, Lybia among them.  Source, please?   After invading Afghanistan the US concentrated their effort on Iraq, the country they wanted to invade originally as a consequence of 9/11.  OK.   At this point Gaddafi saw what the US is willing to do to countries they deem to be supporters of terrorism, that have or are developing WMDs.  OK.  He also understood that without international support his dream of an African Union will never become true. Thats why he approached the international community and offered to dismantle his nuclear program  OK.  that never really gained traction and was pretty much doomed to fail.  Source, please? After all, the impression that I have is that Libya's nuclear program was actually very technically advanced due to the help of the A. Q. Khan network and that Libya's primary weakness as a lack of domestic nuclear expertise.   He did and subsequently became an ally of the west.  Yes; correct!   Iran didnt. They never feared a US invasion due to its sheer size and military power. Iran has always been what the US turned Saddam into, a state with a working military that has huge arsenals of WMDs and an entire people that are willing to die fighting invaders, especially the US. They were sure no one would come after them, especially after the massive problems emerging in Iraq and Afghanistan. The US couldnt handle even a single warzone, there was no way that they would ever try and attack Iran.  It is worth noting, though, that Iran *did* halt all of its uranium enrichment between 2003 and 2005; rather, unlike Libya, Iran never gave up its *entire* nuclear program.   Another thing this made abundantly clear is that you need a nuclear program and nukes to prevent aggressors like Israel and the US from invading your country. I firmly believe Iran will have nukes at some point in time, it doesnt matter if they established their civilian program first, they will get them and rightfully so.  That wasn't that clear in 2003, though; rather, that only became clear in 2011 with Gaddafi's overthrow.   Nuclear energy is a giant money sink when only used for civilian purposes. Its extremely expensive, other forms of energy production are far more economical, Iran is rich on natural ressources, the risk of having your civilian nuclear power plants bombed by Israel/US is far too high and the question of what to do/where to store depleted fuel rods has not been answered yet.   A nuclear program in this day and age has only one goal: The Bomb.  Thanks for this info; that said, though, as far as I know, Iran has stopped actively pursuing an actual nuclear weapon in 2003. Rather, after 2003, Iran has apparently only been interested in having the capacity to build a nuclear weapon.   Iran needs it, Iran gets it. Assad wanted it too, the Israelis bombed his test reactor. Saddam wanted it, the Israelis bombed it.  Do you think that Israel would have been able to likewise effectively bomb Libya if Gaddafi would have insisted on keeping his nuclear weapons program, though?   They cant do that with Iran. Its too powerful. Not only would their Jets not make it there, the backlash would be severe.  What if Saudi Arabia will help Israel bomb Iran, though? Then would Israel be able to successfully do this?   As far as Ghaddafi goes: Stopping his nuclear program and the efforts to get nuclear bombs and allying with the west was what ultimately lead to his death.  Yes, you might very well be correct in regards to this.   In the light of the Arab spring the jihadists thought they could overthrow Ghaddafi and gained a lot of international support. The west dropped his ally who, just months before, had eaten at their table and camped outside UN facilities. They later started a bombing campaign to ensure the victory of the jihadists which in return turned Libya into a Sharia state and established a branch of the IS. Would not have happened with a nuclear armed Libya.  Largely agreed, though I don't think that most of the Libyan rebels are as bad as you make them out to be.    I would have to research it, but I remember they did this shortly after US/UK invasion of Iraq as if to say, "Shit, I didn't know you guys were that serious about these things!"  Yes, I think that the Iraq War was a factor in Libya's 2003 disarmament. However, please keep in mind that Iran also temporarily stopped enriching uranium between 2003 and 2005 (perhaps also due to a fear of the U.S.). However, unlike Libya, Iran never gave up its entire nuclear program.  And they dismantled and verified to us, not to the UN, if I remember correctly.  I think that Libya did this because Gaddafi still wanted to keep all of his options open between March 2003 and December 2003; in other words, during this time, while he seriously considered pursuing a rapprochement with the West, he also wanted to have the opportunity to change his mind in regards to this. It was only in December 2003 when Gaddafi made the final decision to give up his nuclear weapons program and his WMDs. In contrast, if Gaddafi would have come to the U.N. rather than only to the U.S. and Britain, then he might not have had the opportunity to change his mind in regards to this later on. Indeed, I seem to recall that the 2003 negotiations between Libya, the U.S., and Britain were kept secret until December 2003, when Gaddafi made the final decision to give up his nuclear weapons program and his WMDs.   Why didn't Iran? If I had to guess, I'd say Iran was more confident than Libya.  So Iran was less concerned about U.S. military action against it in 2003 than Libya was during this time?  Maybe Libya wanted something from the West and thought it could buy a favor or two with this concession.  Yes, but didn't Iran also want better ties with the West during this time? After all, Iran *did* halt all of its uranium enrichment between 2003 and 2005 (during this time, Iran was negotiating with Britain, France, and Germany over its nuclear program); however, unlike Libya, Iran never gave up its *entire* nuclear program.   But if Libya would have had missiles which would have been able to carry nuclear weapons or even WMDs in 2011 and which would have been able to hit Britain, France, and/or Italy, then this might have given NATO second thoughts about militarily intervening in favor of the Libyan rebels that year. After all, I don't think that NATO would want to risk having British, French, and/or Italian citizens get killed by Libyan nukes or even by Libyan WMDs.   Yes, but please keep in mind that, as far as I know, even with this nuclear deal, Iran would still retain the capacity to build a nuclear weapon. Thus, if things will ever get desperate for the Iranian Ayatollahs, they would simply be able to violate this deal and to quickly race to build nuclear weapons.  In contrast, as far as I know, Gaddafi gave up his entire nuclear weapons program in 2003. Thus, he had no opportunity to quickly race to build a nuclear weapon when things got very desperate for him in 2011.   As far as I know, though, Libya didn't have sanctions on it in 2011; however, this certainly didn't prevent a large part of the Libyan population from rebelling against Gaddafi that year.  Plus, I think that Iran was under much less sanctions in 2009, which in when it experienced large-scale demonstrations against the disputed re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.   Yes, but please keep in mind that, as far as I know, even with this nuclear deal, Iran would still retain the capacity to build a nuclear weapon. Thus, if things will ever get desperate for the Iranian Ayatollahs, they would simply be able to violate this deal and to quickly race to build nuclear weapons.  In contrast, as far as I know, Gaddafi gave up his entire nuclear weapons program in 2003. Thus, he had no opportunity to quickly race to build a nuclear weapon when things got very desperate for him in 2011.    Yes, this might be partially correct; however, I also got the impression that Europe and the U.S. miscalculated by initially calling for Gaddafi to resign when it looked like the rebels would win the Libyan civil war without any help. Then, when the tide began to turn in Gaddafi's favor and (I think) Gaddafi threatened to stop selling oil to the West, the West realized that it miscalculated and decided to help the Libyan rebels by implementing a no-fly zone in Libya and by pursuing a bombing campaign in Libya against Gaddafi's forces.   That was only after a civil war broke out in Libya, after Britain and France lobbied for U.S. military intervention, and after (I think) Gaddafi threatened to stop selling oil to the West due to the West previously calling on him (Gaddafi) to resign, though.   Again, that 2003 "Iran-U.S. grand bargain" claim here appears to be a half-truth:  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/12/09/kerrys-claim-that-iran-offered-bush-a-nuclear-deal-in-2003/  However, I do agree with you that the Bush blew it by including Iran in the Axis of Evil in 2002. With that speech of his, I think that Bush was trying to increase or at least keep his own popularity at home by portraying himself as a fighter against "evildoers" in the style of FDR and World War II; while this speech (as well as John Bolton's "Beyond the Axis of Evil" speech several months later) might have worked (after all, Bush did win re-election in 2004), it also hurt U.S.-Iranian relations for the next decade.   Actually, your 2003 "Iran-U.S. grand bargain" claim here appears to be a half-truth:  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/12/09/kerrys-claim-that-iran-offered-bush-a-nuclear-deal-in-2003/   Please keep in mind, though, that just like Libya, Iran was also at a perceived risk of enduring U.S. military action in 2003. However, unlike Libya (which gave up its entire nuclear weapons program, as well its WMD stockpiles, to the West), Iran merely stopped uranium enrichment for 1.5 years between 2003 and 2005 but never offered to give up its entire nuclear program.   You might very well be correct in regards to this; after all, the impression that I get is that, even before 2003, Gaddafi had already gotten out of the terrorism business by the mid-1990s (but still refused to pay compensation to the Lockerbie victims until 2003); in contrast, Iran still appears to be in the terrorism business even today due to its support and sponsorship of groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas.  Thus, my point here is that, as you said, Libya might have wanted a genuine rapprochement with the West whereas Iran might simply want a modus vivendi with the West.   Fair enough, I suppose.   Actually, Libya was also a signer of the NPT even before 2003.   Any thoughts on this?   I don't think that Israel has threatened either Libya or Iran, though.      Any thoughts on this?            Good luck to you, then! :)         Completely agreed. :)   That's certainly very interesting! As for me, I don't think that I have ever dreamed in black-and-white.               Any thoughts on this?   Yep. ;)   Caitlyn Jenner, not Bruce Jenner. :)         I think that he died a day after the duel; also, I don't think that he died from poor medical practices.         Good! :) After all, it's not like the U.S. embargo on Cuba has produced any positive change(s) there.         Thanks for this information.   In order to save money, no?   Is East Jerusalem genuinely the most valuable chunk of Palestine, though?   The problem (from the Israeli perspective) with annexing all of the Palestinian territories, though, is that doing this will very likely ensure that Israel will no longer have a Jewish-majority population.         Yes, and?               Great news! :)   Yeah; hence my point that not everyone could be a Schindler during the Holocaust even if they wanted to.   What about implementing democracy in Iran? After all, the Iranian people give me the impression that they are more ready for democracy than, say, the Egyptian people are.   Actually, I think that FDR was an economic liberal back in the 1930s.    Because Germany doesn't have double jeopardy laws.  Then Germany should fix that as soon as possible.  They also broadly applied a law to mean the military chef, the guy who washed clothes and the toilet cleaners are all "complicit" in war crimes because they are "essential" the camp (the camp too, not essential to the process of war crimes. Just the camp).  He wasn't actually found guilty of any specific crimes at all.  It's a disgusting political move so they can gain brownie points from their electorates and political lobbies for being the ones to punish a Nazi.  Yeah, you might be correct in regards to this. I mean, I hate Nazis, but if this man didn't know about the Holocaust and whatnot when he joined the Waffen SS, then I don't think that he should be held responsible in any way for it. Plus, in any case, putting someone on trial two or more times for the very same crime seems extremely wrong to me. :(    Good question. If the answer is yes, then I suppose that would answer your original question.  I am not so sure about that, though. After all, theoretically speaking, it is possible that some East Jerusalem Arabs want to become Israeli citizens but are afraid to do this as long as the Arab-Israeli conflict is unresolved in order to avoid being shunned by their families, relatives, friends, and acquaintances.  I know some had the option of citizenship when Jerusalem was annexed after the 67 war, but most didn't take it, similar to the Golan Druze.  Yes, that is correct; however, I am unsure that one can automatically conclude from this fact that most East Jerusalem Arabs prefer Palestinian rule over Israeli rule.   Wait--he's already been acquitted of these same war crimes? If so, then shouldn't it be illegal to put someone on trial two or more times for the same crime(s)?   Out of curiosity, exactly which failed revolution attempts throughout history came the closest to succeeding?  Any thoughts on this?   I've got a question--would this fetal tissue only be the property of the women who get abortions? Or would the fathers of these dead fetuses also have a clean to this fetal issue? Completely serious question, for the record.      Yes, I am aware that the overwhelming majority of Israeli Arabs are Israeli citizens whereas the overwhelming majority of Palestinian Arabs are not Israeli citizens.  That said, though, can't any East Jerusalem Arab (or at least any East Jerusalem Arab without, say, a criminal record) apply for and receive Israeli citizenship? Serious question, for the record.   Also, out of curiosity, if you had to permanently pick right now, would you yourself choose to be an Israeli citizen and to live in Israel or to live in a Palestinian state (assuming that such a state was magically created right now)?   Wasn't Ronald Reagan previously a Democrat, though? If so, then people changing their minds and views over time really shouldn't be viewed as being that surprising.   Thanks for sharing this info. :)   Thanks for clarifying this part.  That said, though, would acquiring Israeli citizenship make life easier for you or not? I am simply curious about this.    It would be a powerful lesson, unlike no other. Skinheads might take heed.  Yep. :) However, I don't think that he will be able to give any such lessons while he will be in jail. :(   Doesn't Israel also provide you with welfare whenever you need it, though?    Sure, that's a legitimate argument to make and should be weighed into factor when answering your question.  Agreed. :)  But everything I said also makes sense too right?  Yes, it does. :)  Either way I'm sure you'll find lots of Arabs who prefer Israeli rule and I'm sure the converse is true that a lot of Arabs don't want to live under Israeli rule, but do so out of basic necessity.  Agreed.  I guess you can say these Arabs have to make a choice between living in good personal economic conditions (filled with discrimination at every level) vs. having freedom but likely way worse economic conditions and poorer social capital.  Agreed.  Basically, I think it boils down to quality of life vs. relative freedom (fair treatment). Different people have different preferences. I personally would choose the freedom route but I can't speak for all Arabs living in Israel.  Agreed; however, it is also worth noting that if Israeli Arabs actually wanted to live in a Palestinian state, then Israel would probably be willing to transfer at least some of its Arab-majority areas to a future Palestinian state in the event of a final Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty. After all, Israel probably wants to become even more Jewish, and what better way to do that than by transferring some Arab-majority areas of Israel to a new Palestinian state? However, I think that many Israeli Arabs themselves protest whenever anyone suggests such a proposal, which in turn might explain why exactly the idea of transferring Arab-majority areas of Israel to a future Palestinian state hasn't been discussed much, if at all, in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.    Iran will have the same problem to contend with. and without the oil,  Doesn't Iran have a more talented population than Saudi Arabia has, though? Serious question, for the record.   and without the oil, why does the US even really care about the Middle East?  Due to Israel, the threat of radical Islam, and the Middle East's strategic location.   The one exception is Israel, and Saudi Arabia is much closer to the US position on Israel than Iran. Now, if Iran's government were (by revolution or otherwise) willing to forgo arming terrorist groups such as Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Hizballah, then I think we would run into the scenario you are describing, and relations between the US and Iran could develop pretty fruitfully at that point.  Frankly, I think that a final Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty is more likely than not to occur by the end of the 2020s (in other words, sometime within the next 15 years).   Maybe the Germans are trying to compensate for being too soft in regards to their treatment of ex-Nazis in the first couple of decades after the end of World War II?   Didn't Schindler have a lot of money which he could use in his quest to save Jews, though? If so, then it is worth noting that not everyone has the kind of money or the same opportunities that Schindler had.   Yep--safe from an imaginary threat.   What about if he's still alive in four years' time, though? ;)   That statement might be overly general, though.   I fucking hate Nazis, but if he didn't know about the SS's atrocities when he joined the SS, then I am unsure that he should be punished for this given his lack of options in regards to this.   Yeah--the word "Nazi" sends shivers down my spine whenever I hear it. :(   For what it's worth, if the court was going to find Groening guilty (as it did), then a better punishment for him would have probably been for him to be required to teach young Germans about the evils of Nazism. After all, four years in prison might not mean very much for someone of his age (assuming that he will still be alive in four years, that is).    Dunno how accurate that one is lol  *Cough, cough* Rob Ford. ;)   Canada--our goody, two shoes, little brother! ;)   Does this ban apply to cartoon child porn as well or only to actual child porn, though?   Before I watched it, I would have probably said either Last Exile or its sequel. :) Seriously. :)   What about if Hillary Clinton will win in 2016?      Jesus had two daddies; just saying. ;)   Wow--this is probably the first time in a long while, if ever, that Angela Merkel said something that I disagree with. :(   Look--I am certainly keeping an open mind in regards to this. However, I do think that you forgot one crucial distinction between Israel and Palestine--Israel, in contrast to (the future state of) Palestine, is a wealthy, developed country. Thus, even with all of the discrimination that Israeli Arabs (as in, outside of East Jerusalem) endure, only a minority of them actually wants to live in a Palestinian state or in another Arab country (as opposed to living in Israel).   Horny cop alert. ;)      Thanks for sharing all of this info. :)   With the extremely recent signing of the Iran nuclear deal, what exactly do you think the future of U.S.-Iran relations will be?   For the record, my own thoughts on this is that U.S.-Iran relations will continue to be pretty cold under the current Iranian Supreme Leader (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) but possibly become warmer under a future Iranian Supreme Leader (after Khamenei's death). Indeed, I expect a U.S. embassy to open in Tehran in either the 2020s or in the 2030s.     In addition to this, though, Iran and the U.S. will obviously continue cooperating against ISIS, et cetera; after all, both Iran and the U.S. have mutual interests in regards to this. However, even after U.S.-Iran ties will become fully normalized (probably sometime in either the 2020s or in the 2030s, depending on when exactly Khamenei dies and on who exactly succeeds him as Iran's Supreme Leader), I expect the Iranian regime to continue its hostile, anti-American rhetoric at least to some degree due to the fact that, as far as I know, the legitimacy of the Iranian regime appears to depend on such rhetoric from Iran's political leaders and from Iran's military.   Also, though, once the oil in Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia will begin running out, the U.S. could move even closer to Iran, especially if the Iranian regime will get overthrown by that point in time. After all, as far as I know, the Iranian people are, on average, more pro-American than many Arabs are, and frankly, this could very well remain the case a couple of decades from now or even several decades from now.   Anyway, any thoughts on this?   Are you yourself a federal employee or a bank employee, though?    At their best, which area seems to function better overall in terms of public and emergency services, utilities and shopping and various other aspects of daily life, occupied territory or Palestinian run territory. And if there's a difference does this hold true in Palestinian territory that neighbors occupied areas?  OK, but what exactly would the answer to this question of yours be?   Why exactly would we get an extra day off if Jimmy Carter would pass away, though?   With the extremely recent signing of the Iran nuclear deal, what exactly do you think the future of U.S.-Iran relations will be?

 The bodybuilder has Quentin Tarantino's face.    Really? Where?   Which was the space opera one?    No   I am so excited for Heart of the Sea   euch what a dumb unfunny thing   I imagine just the setting and story of the new movie, but it'll be full of references and homages to the original like the Lego games are so good at. Also since Lego games always have like a million playable characters to unlock I wouldn't be surprised if some older characters turn up.   Miho Hatori (at least I think that's the name of the girl singing this song) was also the voice for Noodle in Gorillaz' 19-2000    She was so boring and generic and dull as Catwoman    This is a joke. This is Ryan Davis of GiantBomb. Very very hilarious fun dude and he is clearly making a very obviously joke here. He died about a year ago unfortunately   Who?    Not really hidden.   And more like 4 minutes of various clips as opposed to a full movie.   Asked Alex Hutchinson on Twitter and he said [no weapon degradation] (https://twitter.com/BangBangClick/status/501757393190285312)   Ah yes I see it! I really hope that is in fact a weapon degradation bar. Although it's strange that it's not also present on your weapon wheel. I'd really love it to be in the game!   But the new gameplay demos from Gamescom haven't shown anything like that have they?   I've seen many many commenters on here saying things like "since weapon degradation is back..." or "it's good that weapon degradation is back..." but I can't find any interviews or videos saying that this is the case? I'd really love for it to be back just as much as anyone, but it seems like people are assuming without there being any confirmation.  EDIT: Asked Alex Hutchinson on Twitter and he said [no weapon degradation] (https://twitter.com/BangBangClick/status/501757393190285312)   I'm no tank expert at all or even anything close, but maybe that's exactly why they're circling it? Trying to out maneuver it and keep moving and firing so it can't destroy them with a single shot?   Legitimately one of the funniest movies I've seen, and actually made me really sympathetic and teary-eyed toward the protagonists towards the end. Just so happens to be about terrorists trying to blow up innocent civilians. That's some pretty good writing    Jeremy Irons in [Dungeons and Dragons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28snhq40C8o)   All the other FarCry games had vehicles in multiplayer. FC3 tried to make the multiplayer serious and overcomplicated and it just felt like a generic COD rip off. In the old FarCry games multiplayer was all about big customized maps and running people down and crashing and silly but simple Battlefield style madness with friends.   Most of the military dudes I know don't shut up about how much better they are than 'civvies' for all their sacrifices for their country   Not so much caring and honest then    I'm pretty sure this is from a movie that came out this year where Robin Williams plays a guy with a terminal disease, so it's not THAT crazy   Aren't Slightly Mad already releasing Project Cars this year?   California isn't an island    So does the first   It is in fact supposed to be melted chocolate. Harry gets melted chocolate all over the bathroom after it melts in his pants and Bob Saget mistakes it for shit.    Felt especially familiar for me since I lived like 5 minutes away from where that all happened    It looks stupid as shit, but I'm a sucker for aliens and Michael Ironside so I'll still see it   Do all vehicles that get released in multiplayer dlc get added to singe player too?    Hey that lonely white trash is somebody's son    "Hes not like Peter Quill. Theres not much humour, I think hes a little more John Wayne than Marty McFly. Hes deadly serious. There are comedic elements in the film, just not coming from my character."  Huh. I don't think I've ever seen Chris Pratt play a character like that. I obviously wasn't expecting a character as funny and wacky as Andy or Starlord, but I certainly wasn't expecting this. I'm interested to see how this goes.  Theres humour but then, from page 25 on, theres not that much to laugh about.  This is also interesting. I'm no expert, but that seems pretty early for things to go wrong. One of my favorite aspects about Jurassic Park was that we got through almost the entire first half of the movie with *pretty much* no dinosaurs or deaths, and I was really hoping to get a good long exploration of the new park and how it works and functions and people interacting with it and how the dinosaurs exist in the park before everything goes bad.  I really can't wait for a trailer because I still feel like I have no solid idea of what the general tone and direction of this movie will be. I'm excited.   Looks cool. Any more pics? I love Audis but know nothing about this particular model. Why is it so rare and what's special about it   Invasion of the Body Snatchers    Jeez that article took a damn long time to get to the point. Basically it's saying we should stop referring to the alien in the Alien franchise as a Xenomorph, since it isn't the real name of the alien, just a vague term they use to describe a life form they haven't documented yet. Well duh. Xenomorph sticks because it's the only name anyone ever gave it and it's better than the Alien alien.    this isn't even slightly cringy    From the thumbnail I thought it was gonna be a joke with the kid standing on a crack in the pavement   I want to be spoiled   I suck at math, but if you could guess roughly how many hours he spent running, and estimate what his average running speed would be (probably faster than an average man, maybe mid-tier athlete speed) then you could maybe work it out that way.  I haven't seen the movie in ages but didn't he run for pretty much a whole day straight from when he escaped from the city to where his wife was stranded back at their village, give or take a couple hours.   I don't think there's any way at all to get a real answer but you could get a rough estimation.   Yeah, but out here the geese chase you   I'm Australian and I heard it at school all the time as a kid   The Counselor, Prometheus, Oceans 13, Bonfire of the Vanities    Everything about it was weird and wrong and awkward and desperately unfunny   I just finished it on Hard and got all 299 Mudokons, nowhere near under 3 hours of course. Holy crap it's insanely difficult.   Surprisingly I found it got way way easier once you return to Rupture Farms. Paramonia and Scrabmania were nightmarish ordeals.    "It's BONKERS  weird, weird, weird," one person who saw the film told me. "It made me laugh out loud several times, but not in the ways you might expect. The humor is not so much 'Boogie Nights,' as I think a lot of people are expecting. For reals, it tips into, like, Zucker Bros.-level gags and broad humor."  PTA is one of my favorite directors working today, and I'm really looking forward to this film. But I really hope there's a trailer some time soon so I can figure out what the hell this movie is.   I think their current idea is perfect as it works as both. I just hope they pull it off. What I would never want is a remake.   Yeah, you can tell from looking at the eyes and mouth that it's just a display sculpture and doesn't have any animatronics or articulation at all   I'm loving the lots of enemies and guns and fast paced chaos, but the karate and fatalities sound super dumb    Huh. I always thought I was straight. And now this...   Young actor? Mark Ruffalo is 46. 2 years older than Peter Falk was when Colombo started.   Man, that is the best. Congratulations on what will surely be an insanely awesome wedding. And extra congratulations for having a partner awesome enough to be down with a wedding like this.   Either your emcee or your priest better be dressed as Hammond    Sounds like a pretty safe bet.   I just hope the raptors and T-Rex don't get sidelined too much to make room for the D-Rex. I don't mind a new villainous dinosaur for the new movie, but a fictional made up new dinosaur pushing my beloved raptors out of their well deserved screen time is not what I want at all.    A petting zoo, walk through aviary and rafting seem like really really bad ideas.   But at least Jimmy Fallon will be there to make it seem safe and friendly. I hope he talks to Mr. DNA   It's also weird that there's two dinosaurs that are so incredibly similar, Baryonyx and Suchomimus, and yet no Dilophosaurus or Corythosaurus or even Brachiosaurus   My PS3 is still a better media centre than my PS4. Were the stories of these features being worked on true, or am I just never going to be able to properly use my PS4 to watch movies   I like this more than the real one   That's maybe the strangest thing I've seen on this sub   I haven't watched any of The Hobbit films, and this video isn't the best quality, but holy cow everything in this scene looks super fake and cartoony. The fake backdrop, the weird faces, the way the camera floats around all jerky and unnaturally. Then the horse at the end is just absolutely awful.   Are the whole movies like this? I think this submission is especially bad because these are huge mega budget hollywood films.   I always just laughed at this video without ever really bothering to think why she would be doing this, but that's actually really cool   Definitely Nedry. Wayne Knight made a lot of sounds just like that a few times on Seinfeld when doing crazy laughs and screams and whatnot. Plus later in the movie when the can is opened there's no loud squeal sound at all.    I loved Confessions of a Dangerous Mind   Basically, if this game (out on PS4 July 22) sells 250k copies, Abe's Exoddus will be remade in the same fashion. If it sells 500k, a new original Oddworld game will be made to continue the Oddworld pentalogy planned back when the original game was made.

This was my first episode   This really makes me wish you could buy new property in single player   Didn't they tease some crazy awesome sounding project where John Hillcoat was going to make a movie in the Red Dead Redemption engine, and then it just ended up being the first couple cut scenes from the game from different angles or something lame  Might as well put that in the GTA theatre   The Hakosuka Skyline is pretty much my favorite car, so the Warrener is really the car I'm most excited about making it into next gen GTA!   I haven't played GTA Online at all, I completed GTA 5 on Xbox and was waiting for Online to be working properly before I started playing again but I never did. But I'm still super keen to get GTA 5 when it releases on next gen systems. One of the things I'm really excited about is all the new awesome vehicles and weapons that have been released on GTA Online since launch.   I was just wondering, will all these new updates be available for use in single player? Do all the new vehicles and weapons currently become available for purchase by Michael/Trevor/Franklin once you've installed the GTA Online updates?  Rockstar had this to say   "All new content and gameplay created since the launch of Grand Theft Auto Online, including an extensive array of new Jobs, an arsenal of new weapons, scores of new vehicles, new properties and player customizations will also be available for the PlayStation 4 system, Xbox One and PC with much more to come. In addition, the current community of players will have the ability to transfer their Grand Theft Auto Online characters and progression to their choice of PlayStation 4, Xbox One or PC,"   So if we buy the game on a next gen system of some kind, will all these new things be available for purchase in single player from the start?   This really made me want to watch the whole episode. This is so insanely hilarious on so many levels.    Wasn't this movie 'finished' and supposed to come out in like 2012?   And blackjack. And hookers.   There are some fairly big spoilers in this. I wouldn't watch this video if you haven't already seen the film.   Well we already know Wu is back    The director Gareth Evans said on Twitter that the censored version is only a few frames shorter than his original edit, so this isn't really a big deal at all    The Meat Circus in Psychonauts    He said that the scene where Carrie showed Doug her asshole blew his mind as a child   Wasn't that in Lucky Louie?   The exact same cast?   In the first movie there are several references to Dwight having a "new face" that makes him hard to recognize. Josh Brolin will be portraying his old face. I wouldn't be surprised if Clive Owen gets a brief cameo at the end    Wait, it's THE Hanna Barbera Birdman? I thought it was just a generic bird themed superhero. That's awesome.   This movie gets real cheesy and stupidly ridiculous in the second half. Great premise, great cast, terribly over the top and disappointing execution. Pretty entertaining though.    Zimbabwe    She miscarried from the physical strain of singing? I didn't know that was possible    Well as an Australian I know how this feels   The first one was fantastic. The rest were pretty bad   This is the one game that is making me kind of regret buying a PS4. Forza was the only Microsoft exclusive franchise I ever liked, and Forza Horizon was by far my favorite in the series. I never though they'd make a sequel though.   Alpha Dog!    This is such a goddamn stupid idea. Well done on the art though.   Whatever, this made me really want to watch this show   Ah okay. That's pretty cool. I wish The Russo brothers were directing Terminator 5 instead of the Thor 2 guy. Then maybe I'd be excited for it.   Weren't the paintball episodes directed by Justin Lin of Fast and Furious 3-6   God had to kill Mel Gibson's wife just to deliver him the important message that he should probably hit an attacking alien with a baseball bat.    Yeah obviously the cars rotate, otherwise how would the people inside ride them safely       I love learning about classic films and discovering the cinema greats, but a lot of them are quite slow or uninteresting to friends and family, so I always have to watch them alone.   What are some great classics that one could watch with friends and family that will still feel fun and fresh and aren't as 'dated' to people who aren't super into old films?   I heard she and Doug Hutchinson broke up. If these crazy kids can't make it what hope do any of us have   Is Cretacious Cruise a raft ride along a river? If it is that's a pretty goddamn awesome way to incorporate that reference to the original book!   I know there's been a Vice City Stories and Liberty City Stories, and the GTA 4 dlc was Episodes from Liberty City, but had there been a Los Santos Stories?  If this does end up being a new game, and not just someone trademarking the name for whatever other reasons, I wonder if it'll be GTA 4 style dlc or a whole new game like the other City Stories games. Although the GTA 4 dlc was pretty much 2 whole new games anyway.   It looks like there's a ghost behind batman    Okay, but what's under *that* suit?    I'm seeing some very heavy Lee Bermejo influence    Animal Kingdom and Chopper are my favourites, and yes The Rover looks awesome. Dirty Deeds is a good funny crime movie, and Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert is another great comedy. Gallipoli is great, and although I haven't seen it, I've heard nothing but good things about The Square.   But really the most famous Australian classic that everyone loves is Mad Max   Oh man I was also at this expo today and took the same exact picture.     Ugh I can't imagine how pissed and uncomfortable Conan must have been after that. That drummer is a douchenozzle    Yeah, definitely. I don't think either of these guys were willing to own up to anything. The conversation just kept going in circles and it was supremely frustrating.   	109
             Goodwill is the identity of the business in the market. It is intangible business that showcases value of identifiable business assets. Its fame and name and how it is viewed by the target customers in the world of competitive environment. A company which has perfect goodwill in the market succeeds in roping in mammoth target audience and gets elevated sales and profit figures. Goodwill is in fact the report card of the business that epitomizes its success.  *There are many points why a business needs goodwill in the market and few of them are as follows:*  * **Recognition:** Goodwill acts as identity of the company in the cut throat world of competition. It is with the help of goodwill the customers recognize and accept the products of the company. If the company has goodwill in the market, the customers readily accept its product.  * **Trust and confidence:** Chairman   Managing Director of [Cosmo Films Ltd](http://www.cosmofilms.com/) [Mr. Ashok Jaipuria](http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=12736847 ticker=11712910) tells, Goodwill inculcates trust and confidence in the minds of the customers. Customers develop trust in the products and services of the company that has goodwill in the market and readily buy the products.  * **Withstand competition:** Firm that has goodwill in the market can withstand competition and is able to sail through the competitive atmosphere very easily. Customers get enticed with the product of the company and readily opt it amidst other competitive products.  * **Selling business:** Company with good will has high sale able value and gets easily absorbed or merged with other reputed company.   * **Customer retention:** Goodwill aids in retaining existing customers on one hand and on the other it aids in alluring the new target audience. Customers prefer to stick to their brand for umpteen numbers of years if it has goodwill in the market. Say for e.g. women prefer to use the cosmetics brand that has goodwill and that is widely accepted.  * **Confidence:** The Company that has goodwill is able to inculcate confidence not only in the minds of the buyer but also in the minds of the employees who are working in the organization. Employees get motivated to put in their best to maintain the goodwill of the company which will in turn enhance the productivity level of the organization and result in elevated sales and profit figures.  * **Business growth:** Goodwill aids in growth of the business. With customers gluing to the product, new customers accepting the product, the sales and profit figures are catapulted to the new level which results in growth of the business.   Goodwill is the Armour in the companys ambiance with the help of which it allures the mammoth audience and captures the majority of market. With the help of goodwill company is able to reach new levels of growth, plan for expansion and diversification.    lol......      Ancient Rome......        	10
 Does patenting GMO organisms necessarily restrict free exchange of traits obtained through selective breeding?    Plant varieties derived from conventional selective breeding actually can be protected by the [Plant Variety Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_Variety_Protection_Act_of_1970) which offers similar protections that patents do.    Dr. Perlak I first want to thank you for doing this AMA as I believe a lot of the concerns/fears of GMO is one rooted in a lack of dialogue between the public and the scientist behind this technology.    My first question is back in 1999 there was [this](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB919722577962514000) article in the WSJ about how Monsanto has a buddy system in which they pair up a scientist with someone from marketing/finance. Amsuingly you are mentioned in the 1999 WSJ article. My question is, does the buddy system still exist at Monsanto, and what is/was your opinion on the system?    Second question/s are on behalf of /u/MennoniteDan who unfortunely can't post himself due to doing some actual farm work.    A)Can you explain the process of discovery, and implementation, of the genetics behind the new Xtend series soybeans?"  B)"What changes in formulation has Monsanto (and BASF) made to the dicamba in Roundup Xtend, in order to lessen the chance of volatilization? I farm near crops that are very sensitive to dicamba (cucumbers, peppers, peas, tobacco and ginseng) ."    Edit: One last question.    Do you think that the current regulatory environment and public opinion on genetic engineering has negatively impacted research into genetically engineered crops? And if so what do you believe would be a good way to address this issue?    Their genetically modified food is apparently causing most of the human cancers found    There is no strong evidence linking GMOs to cancer.   The real joke is that all the comments in that thread and the actual AMA are scripted paid Monsanto super secret employees. It's shills all the way down!    Cool, thanks for the insight.    Does anyone have a run down on what parts are plastic and what parts are metal? And what is the final weight of this controller?   http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/detail.aspx?chartId=40055 ref=collection embed=True   [Here is a very simple graph on suicides in India.](http://i.imgur.com/FovwdC0.png)        [The largest comprehensive review on the data failed to find sufficient evidence that GMO bt-cotton was a major contributing factor to suicides of Indian farmers.](http://www.ifpri.org/publication/bt-cotton-and-farmer-suicides-india)     We first show that there is no evidence in available data of a resurgence of farmer suicides in India in the last five years. Second, we find that Bt cotton technology has been very effective overall in India. However, the context in which Bt cotton was introduced has generated disappointing results in some particular districts and seasons. Third, our analysis clearly shows that Bt cotton is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the occurrence of farmer suicides. In contrast, many other factors have likely played a prominent role. Nevertheless, in specific regions and years, where Bt cotton may have indirectly contributed to farmer indebtedness, leading to suicides, its failure was mainly the result of the context or environment in which it was planted.     [Here is the 2011 Version](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/jds/2011/00000047/00000002/art00007)           [And a more recent report.](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/03/05/new-research-paper-gm-cotton-in-india-has-probably-reduced-farmer-suicides-not-caused-them/#.UxqR46hn8Uu)   The analysis reveals considerable variation in trends in suicide rates across the nine cotton-growing states. The data, although not ideal, and the modeling do not, however, support the claim that GM cotton has led to an increase in farmer suicide rates: if anything the reverse is true. The Indian farmer suicide story has become received wisdom for some anti-GM campaigners. In fact, we find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole, although contested, do not appear to be notably high in a world context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state.

A lot of times changes to bodywork such as roofline and lights can require the car to go through extra regulatory testing and dramatically increase the cost. Also the design processes and tooling for new bodywork was likely not cheap.    That's disappointing.    I want.   That doesn't show there are GMOs that don't produce fertile offspring.     Edit: Next time also try a more reputable source.            Hybrid seeds != GMO.    That is not necessarily accurate, many of the crops put out by Monsanto are single generation sterile crops    [Why are you lying?](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/10/18/163034053/top-five-myths-of-genetically-modified-seeds-busted) Sterile seeds have never been brought to market and all GMO crops will produce viable offspring.    No it didn't.    then creating seeds that kill themselves after one crop cycle.    They don't, this is a myth.   FDA has never approved a raw plant as a drug. Meth is a single purified chemical, even cocaine is not used as its raw plant form but just the desired purified chemical.     The idea that eating an edible or smoking a blunt will ever be an FDA approved medication is absurd and I'm comfortable putting money on it that we will never see it happen.        Even if marijuana was not a schedule I drug the FDA would still not touch it in it's raw form let alone made into an "edible" with a 10ft pole.       Legal medical marijuana will more closely look like [Sativex](http://www.gwpharm.com/uploads/sativex_banner.jpg) then nearly anything commonly seen at a local dispensary.    the most noticeable difference between a lower model 7 series and an upper model 5 series is size.    That's not really a fair comparison, you should look at similarly optioned cars. In the case of base models the 5 series is only 50k vs the 7 series 74k.    Most luxury cars that IIHS are in the 45-52k range with the sole exception being the new Maserati.     IIHS have said they do not plan to test the Model S at all. wonder why.    Probably because the car is too expensive and has too low of sale numbers to justify it, if Tesla wanted to they can pay for a test of the car themselves.

Also who cares that his study design was an inadequate protocol for chronic toxicity. For with Seralini science is irrelevant as long as we can say GMOs are evil!!!   I totally agree. Saying plague isn't life threatening is like saying a bullet wound isn't life threatening.    [Here you go](http://i.imgur.com/PZyKJVE.png), of note for some of the graphs I couldn't locate all the rounds for Gears1 as they probably overlapped with other shots.       The only range that Gears Beta showed statistical significance was at far range. I still think sample size is too small to make any large conclusion though.     Also my math was quickly done so double check it if you want.    Edit: How positive are you that each map holds the same dimensions? For if the map is a slightly bit smaller or larger that could have a drastic effect on spread.    I'd say 40% more GPU power is more then slightly.    At least I won't die from ass cancer or heart failure.     Meat is a risk factor, it's not necessarily a cause. You can still get ass cancer or have heart failure if you don't eat meat.    The issue wasn't the type of rat used, it was that the sample size was far too small for the duration ran. Testing for carciongencity with this type of rat requires 50+ rodents per group/sex, Seralini decided on using only 10 per group/sex.    You need more shots per group and actually measure the distance from the center each pellet lies. That way you can do the calculations and see if the spread difference between the games is statistically significant.    Alfa 4C, still shocked that the car starts at around 65k.

This risk is derived from three epidemiological studies in the USA, Canada and Sweden based on a statistical correlation between exposure to glyphosate and an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, this assessment was not confirmed in a very large cohort of the also cited "Agricultural Health Study" or in other studies. A recent publication from 2012 has reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans and the relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. The review found non-consistent patterns of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate. The current report of BfR to the EU based on the evaluation of over 30 epidemiological studies came to the overall assessment that there is no validated or significant relationship between exposure to glyphosate and an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or other types of cancer.

Jackson has a lot of relevance to currency for he was against the idea of a central bank.    Actual ranks based on W/L.   Couple this with the "we put it in there to keep people from taking too much opiates    Kind of, the acetaminophen increases the effects of hydrocodone so that they can decrease the dosage of opiates and hopefully lower dependence.    Been playing with one of my friends, servers are really nice but they have made sniping laughably easy.    But I like the irony of Jackson on the 20.    Solution would to make the mac thicker to accommodate an actual desktop GPU. I don't understand the desire for thinness on a non-mobile computer.    You're citation doesn't support your initial claim. Try again.    Also most opiates like Vicodin contain acetaminophen which makes it easier for people to unintentionally consume a lethal dose.    Normally I just refuse to acknowledge any side argument they make until the original one has come to its rightful conclusion.    Yes. I want all cars to come with a carmageddon mode as standard.    sell their synthetic drugs that are less effective    [Citation Needed]   [Here's a study that looked into the environmental impact of switching to GMO crops.](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/gmcr.28449)   It works well for me, also sniper melee is still viable.   They also didn't peer review the study when they republished it.   All I know is that this game seems insanely easy, and with servers the sniper is so OP it's not even funny.    But I miss my roodie.   I think it should go, sniping is already way to easy in this game.    One corporation should not own the means to grow food and also own the pesticide to keep crops growing    Luckily they don't.    I have trouble believing that reddit is really full of people with such weak bowels.    That must be one massive plant.    Why do they make a cure for Hep C if it would be more profitable to make a treatment for its symptoms?    Has the price of marijuana changed at all in the states that passed legalization?    Funny thing is that despite what the DEA says there are clinical trails in progress in the USA.     [They are starting the next one for epilepsy after completing one with promising results.](http://www.pharmabiz.com/NewsDetails.aspx?aid=88888 sid=2)    [And they recently finished one that unfortunately was a failure.](http://www.gwpharm.com/GW%20Pharmaceuticals%20and%20Otsuka%20Announce%20Results%20in%20First%20of%20Three%20Sativex%20Phase%203%20Cancer%20Pain%20Trials.aspx)   There are a lot of preliminary studies on cannabis, but strong controlled clinical trials are just starting to be done.    They just recently finished one nearly a year ago and just [starting to begin the next phase](http://www.pharmabiz.com/NewsDetails.aspx?aid=88888 sid=2).       [Also they've been working on seeing the effectiveness for pain management, but recently the results are looking poor.](http://www.gwpharm.com/GW%20Pharmaceuticals%20and%20Otsuka%20Announce%20Results%20in%20First%20of%20Three%20Sativex%20Phase%203%20Cancer%20Pain%20Trials.aspx)    For some disease/illness, for most cannabis is has the same scientific backing as homeopathy or acupuncture.        Issue with cannabis for medical treatment is that for many disease/illness (excluding MS   Pain management) there is little to no clinical data to support it's use.   Today, if the peanut was discovered, it would get snatched up and a patent would be filed for ONE use.    Realistically if the peanut was discovered today you could not get a patent on it. Now if it was invented/created through hybridization of two existing plants then you could get patent like protections for it.    There is current ongoing research on marijuana for treatment of several disease/illness in the US.    Most likely not, battery tech historically does not show the kind of exponential growth that transistors do.

 Done! Looking forward to it!   	1
       or a buddy cop movie with Paul Giamatti as Chuck Blazer, traveling around the world with his handler FBI agent Chris Pratt to record various FIFA meeting   when they started MILF dont mean anything, it is just their fight go for decades, until the headlines become hilarious   she never said she see Stannis defeat Bolton in the vision   Bolton's fate is already written, their banner will be lowered as Melisandre walk along the battlement of Winterfell,    It is on the trailer   in that movie they did say Sepp is really good in finding money            the vatican can order him to stand trial because they are the one holding the trial, not sending him over to the local authority   surely some production company already have this in development, the story is just too good.    pretty sure law have been accidentally pass    i dont see the logic in this, he have the gun in his briefcase, while he is surrounded by highly trained man with gun in their holster ready to shoot anyone that come for the President. any time there is an attack before he can reach for his gun the agents would have jump on him to cover him or carry him away from the attacker. in what scenario would him ever have time to take out the gun?         also Master of nothingness         you cannot be too careful       who would have known Edmure have it in him   mountainstein going to fuck some shit up, the high sparrow would not know what hit him      once a mannis always a mannis, #teamstannisnoregrets   next season will be legal drama of Ser Davos fighting foreclosure       and the news report will be police chase down kid and shot him in the back         Jack Warner is the gift that keep on giving, John Oliver's writing team can just take a few days off and let this guy create his material.       they have air superiority against ISIS since western jet are providing air support, and they dont run away from ground engagement like Iraqi army. they seen to know what they are doing and have a solid game plan.   it make sense since one of the guy is described as very handsome and have a very big dick      the sale pitch is legit for this van   it was custom made to survive the coming zombie apocalypse                                    the reporters would be double mindfucked   finally, cat's evil plan is exposed      it could be worst, it could have been Sam Allardyce            but if the opposing team did not score from that corner kick, they are in huge trouble from the lighting counter strike         it would be awkward if the partnership is still active when they have to arrest Sepp    prostitution may be legal but pimping illegal.    The guy is shooting an intruder at his house, how is his killing self defense?         on the other hand, it is terrific for people with a lot of debt, all their debt just got inflated away.                                  he is in Florida not Texas         like the high sparrow inquisition, no one suspect the Franciscan inquisition          he can have them broken on the wheel, if Vatican still keep some of their old equipment         this is a crime against humanity         guess who signed the agreement with the Iraqi to withdraw troops   the affidavit to federal court just got unsealed, revealing more information on the hack   GW is the one that signed the agreement to withdraw from Iraq            is this just viral marketing for Jurassic World?      and you think Brazil and India dont do mass digital survaillance?   statute of limitations have long passed on that charge   is that after he look into Putin's soul?    When historians write about this period in U.S. history, it could very well be that one of the themes will be how the United States lost its global technology leadership to other nations  which nation would US lost the leadership to over this? it is quite clear that all other countries with high level of technology are all doing large scale digital surveillance. British have GCHQ tapping the fiber backbone, Russia have SORM, French just last month pass law to have mass digital data collection , Germany have BND collection millions of phone data and pass along to NSA.   the speed analogy is not suitable, the guy withdraw more than $ 3 mil of cash not $ 9,999      Ollie going to fuck some shit up, all this season it have built up to this      he become lobbyist after politics   this is nothing to with gay sex, it is he trying to cover up a case that are already way past statute of limitations   that was the entire defense plan, those diabolically clever bastard   if he is drinking Macallan 1939, he would not have drank more than half bottle a week with that kind of budget   if the terminal ill have access to experimental drugs, would it be ethical for half of them to receive placebo dose?               if he really can't wait why not just share it?   just when you think he cannot be more of an asshole   Boltons are going to be destroy by the Deus ex machina that Shireen blood magic conjured.    wait for next episode, the arrival of the deus ex machina to crush winterfell   that dude never see her give birth to vagina monster   Sesame Street have been specially designed by child education expert to educate kids. they work on every aspect of the presentation to make in hold the kids attention and teach them some new information every segment.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street_research#Background_and_development   how is this a poor decision? he sacrifice her to get the deus ex machina to win the war. a perfectly sound decision   Daenerys Targaryen cut and run during battle, Daenerys Targaryen, wrong for Meereen, wrong for Westeros  - message paid for by the sons of Harpy   the blood magic worked everytime he have tried it. as a leader of men, he must make the sacrifice   Stannis just done what Agamemnon have done, Agamemnon sacrifice his daugther Iphigenia to appease Artemis, so his troops can go on to win the Trojan war.   That would be the most diabolical plan, no one would suspect      the only good thing out of this is that House Bolton will be destroy soon   today will always be remember as the day the Mannis hype train crashed   after the Mannis hype train crash today, i am getting on this hype train.     if Apache patrol the border. some of the Jade Helm conspiracy theorist will lose their mind, the Obama takeover have come         an idea of great genius      up next, North Korea to hold UN conference on open government                  they are dead serious about this, the earth quake was cause by disrespect for the spirit, and the group are going to be charge in native court.        sure that is the reason      china have done it, Yao Ming is an example      a lot of drivers are moron and there is always a chance to be rear ended by these moron everytime you drive on the road, no mystery there            nice try, no one that work in apple store can afford to drink luwak   only if you have a death wish      suggestion for independent did not get majority support.  http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2012-05-18/call-for-independence-discussion-for-american-samoa/946016               but he can do it the other way round, change the appearance of his father and grandfather to look more like him.    there are reason why other Samoans dont support this.   http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/38okr5/us_court_rejects_american_samoans_bid_for_full/  According to Morrison, many on the island feel that American influence in Samoa had already brought a host of changes, like a population boom and more unhealthful food and lifestyles. "Culture is so important to the people of American Samoa that they have fought hard to shield it from foreign erosion," he wrote. "In so doing, they have potentially given up many rights and benefits for which they would otherwise be eligible."  This is essentially the argument that the American Samoan government made when it sided with the Obama administration in the current case. The brief says that American citizenship would also bring new scrutiny to long-standing cultural practices  like limiting the sale of communal land to people with at least half-Samoan ancestry  that might violate the Equal Protection Clause. It's one of the many thorny wrinkles in a case pitting the preservation of an indigenous culture against a broader call for rights.      imagine all kinds of Nazi theme sexual depravity have been done to this panties over the years      he is not getting into trouble with the sex abuse, he is getting into trouble for trying to withdraw several million of hush money without being detected by bank and lying to FBI about the purpose of the money   well, i have seem at lot of male footballer drop to the ground like little bitches after minimum contact. i think they should check on that.  mandatory sex check for anyone that roll on the ground after minimum contact            thug life      George Washington are not running away from hoard of ice zombies   why the fuck did he not row?   he know nothing because he takes the blue pill      Ramsay just reject the advice of a room full of much more experienced military commanders, to lead a mission with only 20 man to attack the best military commander of the seven kingdom. he will be skin alive by the morning.    i guess the best part would be Havelange comment on Blatter He is apparently good at finding money,         i predict the head of most of these FA will be arrested before the game end.  also Argentina FTW   this sound like a terrible decision for his football career, he may be warming the bench most of the time.   so no chance for the HSBC Premier League?   Gazprom Premier League, Qatar Foundation Premier League, Visa Premier League, Mastercard Premier League, Etihad Premier League, Emirates Premier League, Under Armor Premier League, Nike Premier League, Adidas Premier League, KFC Premier League, Imperial Premier League, British Empire Premier League,  which of these sound better?    wait for Papiss TIFU post   have you seen what issue Bush campaigned on.   compassionate conservatism, reduce nation building aboard by reducing foreign intervention, reducing the size of the army      dont Rooney's agent do this everytime during contract negotiation?   well, they are both currently getting hit hard by Hezbollah, Sunni unity maybe?   arsenal did that every season, before the meltdown, crisis and recovery.    for a sport that are unpopular in the US, how did the 94 world cup totally smash the attendance record of previous WC and still stand until today.   friends that bribe together, jail together   origi already learn "Next year is our year"            he is no the biggest coward of the lot, just the first to get nail by the FBI and set this thing in motion, now that so many directly implicated we will see much more people snitching on everyone to save their own ass. i would be surprise if anyone of these crook will be willing to do time for each other.             	196
 Suck it losers!   Lasers is the obvious right answer.   My answer: a lighter.   Also, why'd you specify it may not be food? If it's only one item and it must be something you can see atm, and has to be something you can carry, why the fuck would anyone say food? That twinkie isn't gonna help for shit for an entire month.   I... I don't even know what this person was getting at... did you ask by chance?   And yet there will always be new and amusing/creative answers to read every time, because not everyone that reddits is always online at the same time on the same subreddit.   [Imagine that!]( http://imgur.com/uW8OMR5 )   Gold.   Scott Walker vs Ted Cruz. I don't care who wins.   There's a guy who comes into the gas station I work at who won a significant amount of money in 2004 from the lottery. He still buys lottery tickets, and drives a nice car but other than that he seems like a perfectly normal person. He has a job, he only buys 3 types of tickets (depending on annuity) for a max of 4 dollars. He's a nice guy.   Both. Depends on the situation.   Crooked teeth, flat feet, horrible eyesight.   Dogs cannot be healthy on a meat/animal product free diet and this has been proven countless times... you ain't going to hell for this bro, that shits legit fucked up.   /r/wtf or /r/rage might be more suitable.   Thanks for reminding me how hungry I am cause I skipped breakfast this morning. :-(      Politely refusing to let a police officer search your property without a warrant or probable cause.   If they ask "Would you mind?" and you say "I'd rather you didn't" and they ask again "It'll only take a second and it'll help clear things up" they likely don't have enough probable cause or a warrant and you can hold your ground with your "No." perfectly legally.  Sometimes cops ask even though they do have legal precedence, as a courtesy, and sometimes their claimed legal precedence won't hold up in court.   That's one hell of a jump   Imgur.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imgur   The company was started inAthens, Ohioas Alan Schaaf's side project as he attendedOhio Universityforcomputer science. The service, which the creator describes as "an image hosting service that doesn't suck", was created as a response to the usability problems encountered in similar services. Originally designed as a gift to the online community ofReddit,[9]it took off almost instantly, jumping from a thousand hits per day to a million total page views in the first five months.[10]The website became widely recognized following its rise to popularity onsocial newswebsites such asRedditandDigg.[11]  Can't find the link, but before he officially started it he did state on reddit that he was going to create an image hosting site that didn't suck.   He definitely delivered.   I've never been kicked out of an actual physical real world place so I'll tell you about the time I was banned from a subreddit.  I was banned from /r/creepypms for "victim shaming" by pointing out that when someone initiates a conversation in a blatantly creepy fashion on a random chat app, and despite the giant "BLOCK USER" button, and the giant "END CHAT" button, *and* the giant "REPORT USER" button, you chose to continue conversing with said obvious creep for 45 minutes feigning offense, you're no longer a "victim". You're and amused person seeing how far this will go for extra karma on reddit.  Might also wanna point out that the comment section was full of people saying things like "oh my goodness! I'm so sorry you had to deal with that OP. *Hugz.* I hope your day gets better."  Wtf, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here. OP could very easily have ended the chat immediately.   I can't really say that I *believe there is other life in the universe,* but I'm comfortable saying that I *believe there's a very high probability of past present or future life existing elsewhere in the universe.*   As long as your question isn't a direct copy of something already on the front page (sometimes this doesn't even matter) then it's a combination of luck, timing, and a few good/witty responses from other Redditors shortly after posting it.  Edit: also completely stupid questions like "reddit how do I tell if this girl likes me?" will never make it. Obviously.  	19
 I agree, and I think Bernie has proven in the past that he will get people out to vote.   And watch Inequality for All...it's by Robert Reich...I'd link it, but I can't brain today...I have the dumb   "Sanders is merely the latest version of Howard Dean, another Vermont elected official who surged in early polls by appealing to the liberal base of the Democratic Party and running against the establishments early favorite, who in 2003 was Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry."  Yup...and Kerry couldn't get people out to vote.  Maybe the "Establishment" needs to listen to what the actual voters want.      BERN IT UP!   I want this!!!   "Establishment Democrats 2016: Will Feel the Bern"  FTFY   Propaganda: "Why Americans don't (really) take Fox News seriously" FTFY   Go home Trump...you're drunk.   Is this real life?   Wow...just...Wow   BERN IT UP!   more seasoning? Bernie's been fighting for equal rights since the 1960s!   whatcha hiding scotty?  guess now everyone's gonna start digging...and you havent even announced yet!   She likes smaller, more intimate groups, you know, with rich people   Hey!! That's me and my bf holding the BERN IT UP poster!!   Just a little more common sense from Bernie   This is a ploy to keep the anti equal rights crowd happy while the equal rights crowd says, "Well, his wife is for it, so...  And as far as these death threats go...did this really happen? Or is this just another story they made up?   maybe she doesn't want to have to explain her stance on socialism and the like...   "We don't need to attack each other" = "We have searched and searched but can't seem to find anything bad about him"   Bern it up!  	21
 This is Amy.  To start, congratulations on starting new endeavors!  It takes courage and isn't easy. But it is worth it!   To your questions:  1) It is important to develop a threshold for when to "stop."  Different creators have different thresholds and my research shows that it is important to set a "failure ratio."  By that, I mean that it is important to decide ahead of time what ratio you will tolerate to keep experimenting.  Some entrepreneurs set the ratio to be 1 in 3 things that won't work out - or 1 in 4 experiments - or 1 in 10 attempts to get the business launched.  If you have already hit your "non-success threshold" then it is important to make that decision and quickly change direction.  It is difficult to give concrete advice here without knowing more about your specific startup and numbers.   My best advice is to test your assumptions with at least 3-4 people and discuss your own personal "failure ratio" before making a concrete decision to stop or continue aggressively.   2) Regarding seeing a "gap" and approaching the owner of a patent, it is important to   approach patent discussions fully armed with legal advice.  My best suggestion is to reach out to a patent attorney before you contact the product's owner.  Information is power and you want to be best informed.     I am Amy Wilkinson (www.amywilkinson.com), an entrepreneur, author of The Creators Code: The Six Essential Skills of Extraordinary Entrepreneurs, and lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business.  I have interviewed 200 of todays top creators including science entrepreneurs who have launched The Langer Lab at MIT, Theranos, DEKA, and SpaceX along with the founders of LinkedIn, eBay, Under Armour, Tesla Motors, Airbnb, PayPal, JetBlue, and Dropbox to distill the commonalities that underlie entrepreneurial success.   In this AMA, we will hand you the keys to turn your ideas into enterprises that endure. Creators as diverse as the founders of FoldIt, Chipotle, and Spanx, all shareand have honedfundamental skills that can be learned, practiced, and passed on. Entrepreneurial success is born of daring, discipline, and the six skills identified, proven effective in a variety of endeavors and industries:   * Find the gap: Spot opportunities that others dont see * Drive for daylight: Manage speed by focusing on the horizon * Fly the OODA loop: Master fast-cycle iteration to Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act * Fail wisely: Set a failure ratio and hone resilience * Network minds: Harness cognitive diversity to build on each others ideas * Gift small goods: Unleash generosity to increase productivity  /u/BrianMorin_ACS: I am Brian Morin [(LinkedIn)](http://www.linkedin.com/in/bgmorin), a materials physicist and serial entrepreneur with over 200 patents and inventions generating billions of dollars in revenues.  My current company, [Dreamweaver International](http://www.dreamweaverintl.com), makes separators for lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors from nanofiber pulp using conventional (but very high quality) papermaking techniques. These separators provide much improved safety at a lower cost than conventional separators.  This Thursday at 2:00pm ET, I will be presenting for an [ACS Webinar](http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/acs-webinars/business-entrepreneurship/creators-code.html). /u/BrianMorin_ACS will be moderating the live Q A after the presentation. We would love for you to join us as we talk more about my book and discuss how you can start your own business and how to apply the six essential skills in your business.  We will return at 1:00pm ET to answer your questions!  We are here and ready to answer your questions!  Amy and Brian signing off.  Thank you for the great questions and hope you enjoyed our perspectives!   Good question - as I read in the Economist a while ago, humans overestimate what is achievable in 5 years, and dramatically underestimate for 50 years.  So much could happen in the next 10 years, thanks to all the research ongoing in renewables around the world.  Predictions: i) Big breakthroughs with respect to sodium ion batteries ii) Flexible, cheap, plastic solar cells will become available iii) Water splitting to generate hydrogen fuel will become common iv) Good progress is made to use solar energy to convert CO2 into diesel   Already happening in much of the world, with China leading the way. Good old polycrystalline silicon is a fantastic technology (reliable over 20+ years, good efficiency), but it takes 3-6 years to recoup the energy required to make the cell; after 3-6 years, all the energy produced is 'free/new', which is good.   China is going to probably install almost 17.8 GW this year, which is the equivalent of 18 large nuclear power plants (1 GW each, or so).  That's a lot of power.     http://www.pv-tech.org/news/trina_expects_china_to_hit_2015_solar_deployment_goal  	4
 Absolutely LOVE her!   I love her. I've always loved her. I still don't understand everyone's hate towards her..   Hello Lavern    There was a kid who was called "The Phantom Pooper" he used to randomly poop in the halls around the school ALL THE TIME. Never found who that sneaky bastard was.    Haha yeah Bobs great! Living his life out of the limelight    I don't think I'm entitled to say exactly what went down, but yeah it was never the same after he left.    Fun fact: My dads best friends with their ex drummer bob. Used to go over to his house and play halo 3.    Is there a mental illness for being too poor? I think I have it.    This is the type of shit I love seeing   	9
 http://www.reddit.com/r/GroundZeroMedia/about/stylesheet/  I believe this is it. I also invited you to mod. If you know about Clyde Lewis and his show that could help a lot with how to stylized the page =)   Oh! I'm thinking I need a Mod for Dummies book haha!    I don't know how to do that either. I'm sure it isn't super hard tho.   I don't know how detailed it can be, but I like this one http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ87fQ2HS7Aa4hMwFObTZ6pIKKCnz_vuUASjUW1oYbK1i7TqTdP0kJI61s   Oh man, I'm gonna sound like a regard but what is a stylesheet?   Seeing as how I use a kindle to do all my internet browsing, it would be a huge help to have someone with know how to assist me. If he or she is willing to assist in making this subreddit awesome, I have NO issue letting me help. I also lack html skills.   I created a new subreddit and realized super fast that I have 0, count em zero skills in html. I have a request to make the upvotes ufos. Not a bad idea! No idea how to make it happen, and I use a kindle to do everything so I think it'd be tough to make that happen even if I had the know how. Pm me if you can, or if someone else could I'd appreciate it. Thank you!   Oooh, ufos for arrows, clever idea!   FGM is not the same as cutting the foreskin. Look it up. The eyelids were a better argument. Cutting the clit is similar to cutting off the tip of the penis. That is a much more accurate argument.   They are sending you to a reprogramming camp. You need to leave and talk with an adult, one that is not going to contact your folks. Get a lawyer, too. Do not stay home that night, unlike what others have suggested, the cops will help them because you are a minor and your parents are consenting to this. Please keep us informed so if you need any further advice or help we can do so. You have our support! Be careful and stay safe!   I think the guy is very lonely, and bored. He obviously has time to read, poorly, our comments and berate them. He acts spoiled. I almost wonder if he never was able to get his own free clams, saw the ban, felt gypped, then proceeds to attack folks who did get free clams and feels they shouldn't bitch about an admitted bug in the game. He is a loser.   Crypto_Enigma watches one episode of South Park and thinks he has free reign to insult people. Wow. What an entitled dick.   I just want you to know I laughed so hard at your message. I really needed a good laugh today! Thanks!   I don't see what this guy is being so hateful about. He needs to get a life, lol   Suck a big fat donkey sick, it is just a game. Sorry, the folks over at TinyCo don't share your hatred. Grow up child.   I do not respond well to people who claim I'm pulling info out of my ass/insinuate I'm lying about information I've been given. I read your articles posted and I still think it is a choice the parents can make. I already said, a few times, it doesn't need to be done. I just dislike responding to people who are so angry about their stance. I get it tho, you are uncut and are probably happy for it. Good for you. Go hug your mom or something.   I never said you didn't know what you are talking about. I'm not dumb, just don't see this as that big of an issue.   You gotta look at it but yup! It can simply mean newer meat has come in, and the few days old meat is just ready to be cooked. But freezing it will keep for months! And thank goodness. It's saved many a dinner for me and my family on many occasions.   Um... I've always heard 10%. So, unless you are tugging foreskin to cum, then I don't see why it would really matter. Anyways like I have already stated, I am female so this issue isn't really to concerning for me. Cut and uncut men alike masturbate. Regularly. I have never seen an uncut man using his foreskin while masturbating other than to hold it back.   Cut men masturbate regularly, too. They don't seem to be lacking sensitivity. If it were really that big of a deal I would think they'd cum a lot slower, have loads of difficulty, but it seems to me they are doing just fine.    Your anger toward the issue amazes me.    We evolved to eat meat.   A few of the older women did too. Meat is good for humans. Sure, eat it sparingly, but it is so yummy.   No, but a wolf will eat you. So will your cat if you died.   Freezing meat bought on sale lasts such a long time tho.   Maybe it just really is that normal here. Until I encountered reddit I never heard anyone saying it was weird or wrong. Just seemed, well, the thing you do.   Can you provide a link on that? I've only heard it was 10% sensation in the foreskin.    I've only heard of the babies dying because of unclean or unsafe circumcision practices. I'm not saying it couldn't happen in a sterile situation, but I wonder how many are from sterile vs non-sterile situations.   Lube is for dry vaginas. And masturbating. Unless you want to use cheesy smegma for both, which is gross.    Must've misunderstood. I thought you meant the pregnant mother couldn't decide.   Hope they reply to you. This guy said they'd fix this issue for me and my Boyfriend who is currently owed back clams. And so far, nothing. I don't want to play if I can't bank clams, I don't have that kind of dough to play this game otherwise. Hell, I don't have a job at the moment, I am looking but where I live it doesn't look like I'll be able to afford it after I start working again. It is really expensive.   It isn't convenience for the parent. If someone does it for that reason, I'd say that would be screwed up. I'd just do it because it is normal here and (as a woman) I do think it actually looks better. But hey, I'm not every woman, some women may prefer it. I don't.    10% isn't most. There are still 90% working just fine. But I'm not a guy so I guess I'm not the best to be asking. Talk with guys who are cut, see if they mind. I've never met one that minds, I know guys that are glad it was done. But, like I've said before it doesn't have to be done. Well, except for medical reasons that do exist.    It does, but I guess it is what I'm used to seeing. It doesn't have to be done, but it is something many have done and those boys grow up not minding. My boyfriend isn't complaining about his lack of extra skin missing. I only see guys with foreskin that get so upset about this. It's a matter of perspective and what is normal for where you live, I suppose.   Actually, termination of pregnancy is a woman's choice. Unless you like all them welfare babies. Go ahead, pay for them.   Eyelids are a bit different than foreskin. My eyelids aren't there for sexual purposes and the lack of them would cause incredible medical issues. You can't compare the two.   It's the parents choice. It really isn't that big of a deal, really. At least I don't see it that way. But then I'm American, so I guess it's just normal here.    It is pretty rare for babies to die from circumcision, unless it is done unsanitary. Can totally see that.   A long time ago I read a comment from a guy who had it done later in life, said he couldn't tell a difference in sensation.   No. They get all up in arms about guys that are circumcised tho. What's funny to me, I've never met a circumcised guy who thought their circumcision was a bad thing. They have no issue with it.   It depends. Sometimes the shifting of one set of tectonic plates can stress other ones, even hundreds of miles away. This isn't too common, but can happen.   It's really up to the parents if they get their son circumcised. It is way common in America. I'm atheist and I'd do it to my boy if I had one. It is just normal here, and as long as it's done sanitarily I really see no issue. Female circumcision is vastly different, and causes vast issues for girls. Guys that are circ still jerk off, still cum normally, the loss of sensation is minimal (men still prematurely ejaculate with alarming regularity while circumcised). They just don't have Smegma and have less issues with cleanliness. It actually does reduce std transmission. Also, I've had both, and as a female, it is easier giving head to a guy who is circumcised because you don't spend all that time pushing foreskin back, more time spent playing with the shaft. I also know there are men who get the surgery done because of actual medical purposes. Does it have to be done? Almost always, no. But it can cause shaming in the boys locker room when you got extra skin down there. But then, such is the American way. Oh, and a circumcised dick looks visually larger, which is a plus to women.   The fuck is wrong with people?!   Also, when I was very little, I remember they actually didn't want to be called Christians. Many are brainwashed out of remembering this, but old die-hard Mormons pushed it hard on me and the rest of the kids  It's only more recently they want to be called Christians to seem more mainstream and normal. They have a whole set of different books than the bible, and rarely refer to the bible. They use it less and less nowadays, and have actually cut old testament classes in many lesson plans.   Mmmm... They say they do. But I distinctly recall talking about, singing about, and praying about Joseph Smith a whole lot more. Don't be fooled by their name, just because it has Jesus Christ in it doesn't mean anything. Their beliefs stem from Joseph Smith's teachings, not Jesus. It's a ruse.   There are many differences between Mormonism and Christianity. This isn't the place to go into it tho. Go over and ask r/exmormon If you would like enlightenment on THAT subject.   Mormons aren't Christians. They just say that to make the cult seem less culty. Still a cult tho. (And yes, I know wtf I am talking about, was Mormon most of my life)   I don't see circumcision as that big a deal, either. I know globally it isn't popular, but... yeah. Smegma IS nasty. Period.    Maybe not for males, but it seems female circumcision is on the rise. It is fucking awful and usually done in such unsanitary conditions that many girls die or never fully recover. Also, I can't see a real issue with doing it to boys. Double standard? Maybe, but what they do to those girls is criminal.   I would do it if I had a boy child. I'm not religious, I'm an atheist. I'd just do it because it is cleaner. A lot cleaner.   I know a lot of men that aren't upset with their circumcision, in fact it seems uncut men are the ones who get angry about it. But cutting a baby for mourning? Truly fucked up. That baby looks so scared. It is palpable.   So... what'd you end up doing with the doll?      Let's hope she follows the science and evidence. If she does, she will clearly see that the scheduling is wrong. I hope that the history of why it was scheduled the way it was is due to racism was brought up as well.   Oh, I read it. But I've seen this story before. I also heard that officers of the law involved knew they were taking this child away from a safe, loving family but their hands were tied. I heard that one of them quit after she died because he was so disturbed his forced actions caused a child to be murdered.    Marijuana use didn't kill this girl and from what I've heard, can help with seizures. Sounds to me like they should legalize out there for medical and have let that girl stay with her family. They weren't the ones abusing her, the state and Sherril Small did.   Actually they replied to me in a post about this offering to fix this bug. You can check it out! I replied asking them to fix everyone's accounts. No reply from them yet, but if enough people ask for this the might do it. This is a bug!   Tiny_Matt actually replied to my post about this, he said they would fix my account. I replied and asked they fix the bug for everyone in the same blanket way they reset all the accounts. No reply yet, but I think if enough people ask for this they just might do it.   It works in my browser, http://www.reddit.com/r/groundzeromedia   Ain't that the truth. I've been non practicing for years now, and it still affects me from time to time.   I made a subreddit for it, r/groundzeromedia   Try r/groundzeromedia   Already have...   Public shaming, beating while tarred and feathered, then put into the most dangerous prisons where the guards will look the other way.    Well damn. I only saw 2 (including yours). Quite the photographer we have there. I'd have wrapped her in plastic, all Laura Palmer style. But then, ain't my murder.   For everyone bitching, /b/ had to go somewhere. Also, OP is a faggot. =)   Who? And what?   Good catch!   I didn't realize the dude posted more than one pic of her.   I don't think her son will be browsing r/toosoon anytime in the near future.   Does not exist anymore on imgur. Oh poo...   I've seen Bender in Tapped Out once. I took a pic of it too. It made me so happy.   I miss Futurama so much. I am happy for this but I wish they'd just bring it back. I love you Bender! You're my favorite robot ever!   Ummm... I don't know why you are posting this to me. I am not a giver.   Well, if you want to check out my subreddit you are welcome to. I want all opinions. Paranormal, scientific, or just your two cents. Dialogue that is open is fully allowed. =)   Why'd you post me that?   *eyebrows raised* Now this is interesting. Could there be disinformation going on? Certainly wouldn't be the first time.   Welcome one and all to Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis! This is a place where we can get weird and discuss an awesome radio show that I enjoy listening to. Dealing with the strange, paranormal, and macabre, nothing is taboo! Talk about your favorite shows, or just the most recent! If it is paranormal related it belongs right here! Clyde's show is like nothing on the radio right now, his broadcasting skills are excellent! If you enjoy Coast to Coast AM or miss Art Bell, this is right where you belong. If you haven't listened to the show, or it just isn't broadcast in your neck of the woods, you can check out the official website here: http://www.groundzeromedia.org/  Thank you for stopping in, I do hope you'll join this sub!   I finally did it, I created a subreddit for this show. Hope people out there in radioland are listening in and want to discuss the shows! Go over to r/groundzeromedia If you're interested! I'm excited to hear the thoughts and ideas of everyone! I know this can be a great little piece of reddit if we all work together as a community. I'm really new to this, so any thoughts, ideas, or help making the page really great are appreciated. Thank you!   I made a subreddit! Go to r/groundzeromedia If you are interested. Obviously I am the mod, so if you have any ideas, let me know!   I made a subreddit! Go to r/groundzeromedia If you are interested. Obviously I am the mod, so if you have any ideas, let me know!   As I promised, here is a link about Dybbuk Boxes. There is more than one, I believe this is the most famous one tho. http://www.dibbukbox.com/story.htm I also know there was a movie made about it a few years ago. But it doesn't hold a candle the true story. Clyde's show on this was awesome!   I appreciate this, but I am seeing posts that show other people are encountering the same issue. Now, I'm no programmer, but I may have a cheap, quick solution to this issue I think everyone will appreciate, a lot. Why not go back into all the accounts you reset and blanket fix the issue. I believe this would save time (so you aren't fixing this bug individually) and it would therefore save money. I don't have access to my boyfriends game info, so I can't just give that out. But I know y'all as creators do have the info of all reset accounts. If you can do this, send me a message, or, put a message in game at startup saying this bug has been fixed. You can even put in a strongly worded message to everyone reminding to not hack or be banned. I know the fans would appreciate this and I think it might help with TinyCo's reputation a bit. It's a win-win. I know I won't be hacking it anymore, and I think a show of faith in that matter will sway others from doing the same. Of course, there are asses out there who will hack and need banning but I believe this could stem the tide of it. Anyways, I appreciate your response to this issue. It has actually convinced me to not delete the game. Good show, sir!   And, yes, this is from Tiny_Matt. Suck it up child, you are wrong.   Yo, just a little FYI, TinyCo does not share your sentiments  We're looking into this now. If you've been set to 250, then the warning/flag is considered complete.  Did you happen to force close when you saw the original TOU popup?  Also, does the TOU popup still appear when it moves to 250?  If you'd like us to take a look at your account in particular, please send a note to Support and DM me when you do. (I'll make sure it gets looked at.)     There are lots of bugs with the game itself, it's a smaller, cheaply made TSTO game. If I had money to spend, I'd probably be much more willing to give it to EA just because they weren't douches about the hacking.    I feel you. 110%. It is better than what C2C has become. I also long for Art. His voice was my night growing up.   How do I make a subreddit? Oh it would be awesome!  I will try to find a great link about the dibbuk box for you. They are creepy!    Oh, btw, TripleSkeet, TinyCo messaged me and they actually offered to fix the problem. They were pretty nice about it. I think RyanMercer needs to get off the rag. Maybe smoke some reefer, take a nap. He's way to aggressive about his views, which, as I can now plainly see do not reflect TinyCo's views. Gotta be honest tho, a little nervous about them fixing just my acct. I feel like this, if they can blanket reset everyone's accts to 250, they can blanket fix the problem. I feel like it's a much cheaper and quicker fix. It might also restore a tiny smidgen of faith in the company.   It just sucks is what it is. I don't mind legit banking clams, I have no money beyond the bills I pay and the food I put on the table. I play this game because I find it a nice escape from the doldrums of my day. If they think they are getting my little bit of money for this game, I'm sorry, it just isn't happening. I have none to give. Not for oscillations that as transducer said 'is fucking theirs, they own it, not you'. But if I can't bank clams beyond 250, really, I can't buy much, if anything.   This is exactly my point. I understand that they can take away stuff I got by having my game hacked. But it isn't right to take what is freely given, as you said perfectly, as a prize.    Pffft, we all should know the truth by now. Next Fallout will be Fallout:Deathclaws Revenge. You play a deathclaws abandoned by the Enclave. With him you will waste entire villages and cities. It's gonna be great!   That's basically what he is. He does shows that blow the other guys content out of the water from time to time. So many of his shows I'd really like to discuss, especially ones where he resonances on weird stuff. Like the Dibbuk box. Show gave me the willies!   We really do. His show is great.   I guess I'll just stick with the Facebook page then.   If you can't get over the fact they stole legit goods then I am done with you. You obviously are a shill. Gtfo   But he lost legally gained clams *after* the reset by TinyCo. Also, as I've been learning, he isn't the only one. TinyCo is being ridiculously dumb if they think they can just take clams they are freely giving out. I mean, if you give something to someone and then turn around and take it back that is called Indian Giving. It isn't the way a company should be running their business, it will lose customer loyalty faster than anything.   So, explain why you are taking legitimately gained clams from us. I'd really like to understand why you are Indian giving them.  	98

 High school. Cliche, but we're still going.   It's at an awkward angle for me to try and get a picture. This was taken in the ER .   Just saying what the doctor told me. I have no problem with spiders, just as long as they're not in my bed! :)  	3
 My first memory. Seeing grown-ups, grannies, moms and dads standing around crying. Coming to our house to watch our TV and worse, my dad crying in his room, walking in on him.   Something really really bad happened that day that changed things for the worse for everyone.    I love seeing pictures of common, everyday elements in artifact collections. Much better picture of most peoples lives at that time and place.   Been to the Tap House many times. Wondered why their beef was so tender. Great beer too.     Platters were record albums.    Woo http://www.in-fisherman.com/news/sharks-in-illinois/   I have been a very involved weather researcher and watcher since the mid-70's. I have seen the jet stream do things in the past 5 years that was incomprehensible.. until I found this study.    I was thinking a young Bull Shark. The description of the one attack in which it jumped out of the water to grab the victims arm seems too aggressive to be most other shallow water sharks.   Did you hear about the Bull Shark that killed the man in his Florida Canal?   Edit: http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=95960   It would be important for you to see this https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU   I just checked and you changed your mog. I need to know what those shoulders and gloves are?   She is wearing mostly the [Overcast set.](http://www.wowhead.com/itemset=815/overcaster-battlegear)  And the Staff of the Verdant Circle http://www.wowhead.com/item=65462/staff-of-the-verdant-circle  My druid often sports the robe version http://i.imgur.com/T364jVx.jpg  Which drops from Svala Sorrowgrave in Utgarde Pinnacle http://www.wowhead.com/item=127502/ymirjar-physicians-robe bonus=615  There are similar pieces listed on those pages.      All of these attacks have been by a approx. 5ft shark in waist deep water. Either one, rogue shark or cluster attacks due to lack of natural food.                         Oxy is illegal in most of Europe and Asia.   Ok thank you.   Some scientists have said that fracking could cause cracks and shifting of the ground releasing gas pockets like these. Any fracking/drilling in the area?   My mind read that as 1492 and I went 'wow'.    I have a strong feeling that you don't understand that this sub is satirical.  ...  wow.   Or is there a connection between dreams and reality that we cannot yet adequately explain?  I collect prophetic dreams from various places online. Here is one of them that I am sure relates to the Japanese quake and tsunami of March '11.   7-30-90 A friend of mine was told in meditation to expect 400,000 casualties in the future. I meditated on it to pinpoint the event.   Meditation: I called Babaji to confirm or deny the previous vision of my friend.   A. He said, "We will use this as a testimony to the future."   I saw many, many oriental faces. All of them were running from the right toward the left. They were all saying, "You are right, you are right, you are right"   I saw some kind of game going on. The voice said, "I haven't done this in quite awhile. Slow down, slow down."   I saw a three dimensional map. The voice said, "There will be a radioactive factor of 80%".   I saw a circus in the foreground and great destruction in the background and it came to me that this referred to the 'Olympics'.   NOTE: 1998 is the first Olympics to be held in Japan.   NOTE: 1998, THE Olympics were held and there was a SMALL earthquake. Nothing of any consequence occurred there.   by Dee   http://www.greatdreams.com/disaster-dreams.htm  ---------------------  The interesting thing is that the Japanese had to convince the Olympic Committee that the Fukushima radiation was not a danger in order to be chosen for the next Olympics 'against a backdrop of total destruction'.   About the "I haven't done this in a while." The areas flooded in 2011 closely matched those of a tsunami that hit Sendai in 869.  People running 'right to left' would be from the ocean, inland (to escape the tsunami).  So I find prophetic dreams/visions to be very interesting. Maybe complete coincidence, but maybe something else. Either way they fascinate me.   Well thank you!    Guess what? I spent a couple of years studying the links. What countries suffer this, what countries do not, what are the links and similarities and dissimilarities.    I didn't do it for you- or to write a thesis, I did it for my own curiosity without intentions of even discussing it.   Now. I have spent enough time handing you my thoughts on this.  Take it or leave it. Looks like you are already seeing through a biased lens so I well know I am completely wasting my time.    This. This pisses me off. They are supposed to be used in endangerment cases, not to chase moms and dads around who may have been trying to get their child out of a bad situation.    I had to read that 3 times. That is too damn sad to be believed.   How in hell did they ever get their claws on Lisa Marie?   I thought this was short for 'Thor's well, in Oregon'.

Our Columbine shooters were on a total of three of them. Klebold was on Paxil and Zoloft, both. and   Harris became obsessed with homicidal and suicidal thoughts within weeks after he began taking Zoloft, according to Dr. Tracy.  Due to his obsession with killing, Harris was switched to Luvox, which was in his system at the time of the shooting, according to his autopsy. However, the change from Zoloft to Luvox is like switching from Pepsi to Coke, Dr. Tracy said.  http://psychiatricfraud.org/2011/04/the-real-lesson-of-columbine-psychiatric-drugs-induce-violence/               [Markleeville](http://www.ebbettspassadventures.com/places/markleeville.html) - Ebbetts Pass. My favorite stomping grounds. Feeling bad here.      They are protesting having their water and electricity shut off for periods of the day as well as lack of basic medical care. In a lot of the poorer regions the water has been privatized and they have to pay for cold water instead of it being covered (as previous) by taxes.  Like one man said- they were trying to get help for a firefighter and the hospital couldn't give them cold water- they had to go buy it to cool him off.   This is one of my serious pet peeves- the privatization of anything that can impact human health and welfare. Because the people profiting don't give a fuck if you die in the street- profit margin trumps life every time.   Wow. This is horrifying.   The fact that were seeing multiple toxins at the same time, were seeing high levels of domoic acid, and were seeing a coastwide bloom  those are indications that this is unprecedented, Trainer said.    Scientists suspect this years unseasonably high temperatures are playing a role, along with the blob  a vast pool of unusually warm water that blossomed in the northeastern Pacific late last year.     This is new territory for us, Ayres said. Weve never had to close essentially half our coast.   Check Las Vegas. Just type Las Vegas Club in google and search images.    If it's not too late- change the name. Shorter is always better.    The French Resistance undertook nearly 1,000 acts of sabotage in the hours after the Normandy invasion began, and the damage they inflicted on railroads and other communications played a crucial role in preventing German reinforcements from arriving quickly in Northern France.     And every time a German troop train was sabotaged, a nearby French village was likely to suffer horrendous retaliation -- like the town of Tulle, where a hundred men where seized at random and massacred three days after the Normandy invasion, or the village of Oradour-sur-Glane, where 642 citizens, including 205 children, were killed the day after that. The men were shot; the women and children were burned to death in a church.    "We were depending on considerable assistance from the insurrectionists in France," Eisenhower remembered. "Throughout France the Free French had been of inestimable value in the campaign. ... Without their great assistance the liberation of France and the defeat of the enemy in Western Europe would have consumed a much longer time and meant greater losses to ourselves."  http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/06/opinions/kaiser-ve-day-french-resistance/   Getting ready to freedom your free healthcare right into the hands of freedom loving private companies!

My great grandmother lived in that house until the 1980's when she passed away.  Sometime in the late 1940's she had a medical issue that made it hard for her to climb stairs, so her husband built this little, one bedroom cottage with a bay window and all of the amenities a ways back on the property where she could recuperate. He built that rose trellis, planted the climbing roses and planted a garden around it (unfortunately is not visible in the pictures)  After grans recuperation the 'little house' was used for everything from family members needing a resting place from troubles to honeymoon quarters.  Sorry about the potato quality pics.        Not sure if you are familiar with 2010 heat wave, or the 2009:  By the time the heatwaves had ended in late October 2010, about $500 billion (2011 USD) of damage was done, in the Northern Hemisphere alone. The heat waves had caused around 17,905,000 deaths globally, with 3,000+ direct, 17,821,672+ indirect, and 21+ unconfirmed deaths  Russia: On July 30, wildfires killed 25 people, leaving more than 2000 people homeless. The fires were still burning on 1 August.  Likely in part due to the heat wave and smoke from forest fires, Moscow recorded 14,340 total deaths in the month of July, 4,824 more than the number recorded in July 2009. Pollution levels in the city were five times higher than normal.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Northern_Hemisphere_summer_heat_waves   A lot of people think differently, but it takes a brave soul to express it.   This is the problem with mass poverty. When people are poor they cannot escape climate or geophysical catastrophes. If they don't work that day- their families don't eat that day.     Debate isn't the definition of freedom of speech, your right to say, think, write, and create whatever you want is your freedom of speech, and it should never be limited.  Your free speech is limited every day. You cannot, for example, speak in a way that threatens the life of another or incites rioting or panic.  Another way it is limited is by peer pressure - this is an internal limitation created by our instinct to 'go along with the group'. This is a safety instinct that all people have to a greater or lesser degree. People who internalize a lot of fear or self-doubt are more willing to 'go along', even despite their real feelings.   See: Lord of the Flies.      ppl you never imagined as racists will start flying it at their houses just to make a point.  Best answer to that? Make fun of their ignorant asses to the point where the only 'point' is how stupid they are:  As John Oliver said:   The confederate flag is one of those symbols that should really only be seen on t-shirts, belt buckles and bumper stickers to help the rest of us identify the worst people in the world.    This is because you have a population that is suffering, financially and under a great deal of stress. People are angry.  Then you have groups who are subtly misdirecting the source of the pain and anger toward those people they can lash out at - easy targets because of their skin color or sexual preference. Much easier to get mad at those gays or blacks than to try to go after a multinational banking system.  Then you have some marketing genius that came up with the term 'SJW' which is used in a derogatory manner to black-label people. A lot of redditors are cowed by that.   I saw someone make a genius post about racism that was nearly on the level of a Martin Luther King. His post was highly accepted but then suddenly he was shouted down and bum-rushed the moment he was called an 'SJW'.   Many Redditors, for all their proclamations of 'FREE SPEECH' are more groupthink creatures than they would ever admit.   I just posted this to someone else - but here goes   StormFront is the opposite of free speech. There are no arguments against racism allowed on StormFront. Just try it and see how fast your free speech is banned there.   Open forums where people can argue pro and con is free speech, which is why Reddit, even though it has some putrid subs, is not banned in Germany, Italy or France.     StormFront is the opposite of free speech. There are no arguments against racism allowed on StormFront. Just try it and see how fast your free speech is stifled there.  Open forums where people can argue pro and con is free speech, which is why Reddit, even though it has some putrid subs, is not banned in Germany, Italy or France.    And do you remember the reactions of the citizenships that had 'no idea' about the terrible things being done?  It's like a german told me in the late 1960's when I questioned him about this.  He said that the attacks on the jews started with flyers - papering - being delivered that said negative things. Then eventually it reached the radio and newspapers. So everyone everyday was reading bad things about the jews and beginning to believe it.  In his neighborhood - there were 3 people on his block repeating these things, then 10, then eventually the majority, repeating them so often that even the most open minded began to believe or at least pretend to believe so as to not come under pressure.  And that every german adult with 'half a brain' knew exactly what was happening. They had just been 'primed' to not care and turn away.    Re-read my post. I didn't say that at all.  I said that Sites (such as [StormFront](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormfront_\(website\))) are banned in countries in which negative PR against certain races was propagated to the point that a world war and genocide resulted.   I can't criticize their choice to do so seeing the historical result that they experienced.  Reddit is not banned because on reddit there are many people of many creeds who go to racist subs and provide alternate viewpoints. Sites such as StormFront forums are a solid wall of hatred with no alternative viewpoint allowed.   See the difference?   Did you see this? http://www.discogs.com/artist/2337287-Jim-Salvati   I was looking at some of your old newspapers of that era and they are so focused on this subject (anti-alcohol) that the stories and cartoons are almost Onion-like in their fervor.   The story of how Burnett's Mound protected Topeka from Tornados until they dug out the side of it for a water tank.   It was always told by Chief Burnett that the mound must not be disturbed because it was a sacred place watched over by the Great Spirit and those who have past on must always be respected. The people of Kansas believed that by respecting the Chief's wishes that the mound would protect the city of Topeka from the devastating power of tornadoes.    In 1960, Chief Burnett's mound was disturbed with construction at its base for an interstate bypass. Upon Burnett's Mound itself, it was cut into at the top of its north side, perfectly visual for all Topekans to view as its desecration continued to fit a 5 million gallon steel drum reservoir water tank. In the following years, building began to slowly progress around Burnett's Mound.     At 6:55PM on June 8, 1966, a tornado of immense power struck the city of Topeka, destroying all within its path. It lasted 34 minutes ending at 7:29PM. The F5 tornado was a half mile wide, as about 820 homes were destroyed and 3,000 damaged. Entire blocks were leveled to splinters in seconds. The tornado's violent winds had estimated at around 300 mph.     Total cost was put at $100,000,000.00 making it at the time the costliest tornado in American history. Even to this day, with inflation factored in, the Topeka tornado still stands as one of the costliest on record. The tornado claimed 16 lives, injured over 500 people, and left over 3500 homeless.   I'll just drop this on ya: Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.   There is no debate in Germany, Italy or France. They have had experience with this that lead to a World War and the genocide of millions. Hate sites are banned in those countries. I can't judge them for that, knowing their history.  I can't say for sure that Roof would have become racist from encountering racism in other ways, maybe meeting someone and being invited to a KKK meeting, for instance. I can just go by what he wrote of his personal experience in his death manifesto.    Roof said explicitly in his manifesto (that was released a couple of days ago) that he was not raised racist and he 'woke up' after discovering a white supremacist website online.   So basically he would not have found the sanction and encouragement to be as racist as he became - racist enough to go on a shooting spree.   What the hell can I say? It's a fucking shame, but it's a fact.             Yea.. that damn horse is long gone.   Excellent response. I am so sick of hearing right wing commentators newscasters and politicians jumping through flaming hoops and tiptoeing over beds of nails to avoid mentioning 'race' in this incidence.   Identify and fix problems? The day it happened I posted about the problem of 24/7 racist sites - including subs on reddit- and how they can impact the weak minded. I got d/v to hell.   http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3a9ec9/charleston_church_shootingmanhunt_megathread/csbhgmt  When I was young I listened to Germans who escaped Germany talking to my great grandmother on a regular basis. I know what the effect of 'papering' (as they called the dissemination of racial tracts) can do to drive race-hate. People can deny it all they want but they need to face up to it.   Once an belief has *sanction of approval* by seemingly large numbers of people or government action the believers tend to multiply like cockroaches and start acting out. The Confederate Flag on government land is one type of sanction of approval.    Everyone's just rushing to shut that fucking barn door, aren't they?   For a sec I thought the mom was on the right.    You would have to ask the red pill guys about that.    It's saddening really.

I would widen the moons to match the width of the font lines. Perhaps even join them top and bottom in a sort of overlap. Also, work with each letter separately to make sure your [kerning](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Kerning) is correct. It's somewhat off.   Also shadowing- it can be a serious issue when you go to have any printing done. Ok for website work but not print.   That being said, you might want to rethink the colors of the moons.   A couple things to do while working:   In between changes, take 5-6 steps back from the work and look at it from a distance. Also, take it down to 100px at it's widest and make sure it is still readable.   GL- much better!   Very difficult to read. Dump the shading for solid blocks of color. Some letters fat others skinny and pointed. Way too much 'busy-ness with the moon overlays'.   Remember- a logo is not supposed to be a work of art. A logo is an *impression hit*. Bam. Your viewer needs to be able to absorb it, mentally interpret it (and remember it) in a split second.   Anytime a viewer has to spend even a whole second or two trying to interpret the impression, you lose. I had to 'work' on this one to read it.   Needs a do-over.   I was trying to reply to the original commenter and missed the mark there. Yes we are.    Looks like my current desktop. A picture that I took in Antelope Canyon. How is the lake, btw?   I come from a long line of progressives and we had volunteers in every war up to and including Vietnam (although I think that that person only went because of the people we had in ww1 and ww2 and a belief that we were protecting the country as we had back then). We also had people a generation back march with blacks in Selma and my aunt used to take me to anti-war protests at the university.   We also have a few gun owners in the family who keep them for safety.   Watch the broad strokes there is all I am saying.    He went to the police and asked them to arrest him just before the events.

No seriously, get into Illustrator and start playing around. Come up with something cool.   I am very sorry to hear about your mother. I think it may help you to read this essay on a mans journey through his wifes cancer.  [Here.](http://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a34905/matthew-teague-wife-cancer-essay/)  I decided years ago that if I had invasive cancer I would opt for palliative care only, following what our family doctor of many years did. Most doctors avoid aggressive treatment under these circumstances. This was only recently affirmed for me after reading the essay I linked above.  What I am saying here is that perhaps your mother felt this way also. And she took her own way out, not yours.   All I know of Reiki is that there are some practitioners who work with a University medical center/hospice near me. I very much doubt that they reject standard medicine.   I had a friend who was diagnosed with HIV in 1985. He was a Peruvian, but had been living in Utah for decades. He rejected "western medicine" and went with alternative therapies, marijuana, diet modifications, etc. This had nothing to do with 'religion', it was just his choice.  We went hiking and mountain climbing in 1999 and he looked and performed like an athlete. He wore me out.  In 2000 he went to the hospital for minor emergency surgery to remove his appendix. Surgery went great. He died a day later from an accidental overdose of morphine from the wrong setting on the self injection machine.   It would have been easy for us to rage at standard medicine, but none of his loved ones chose to do so.   I hope that if I get cancer that my children will be accepting of the choice I make and do not hold the people who assist me in that choice accountable for my death.   And I truly hope you are able to release your anger and find some peace.        talked to by police tried to back up, appearing like they were going to flee.  Watch it again.

If that money were coming out of the FOP Retirement funds instead of taxpayer pockets, this shit would stop yesterday.   They weren't being 'disobedient' to this cop. Their car was parked and not moving beside the other cop car. Until he jumped out of his car and immediately fired on them.   They were sitting there, parked beside the other cop car, until the shooter (cop) pulled up, jumped out of his car and started shooting at them point blank. *Then* they tried to back out.   I was just looking (and found his dad) but a lot of people drown on the Connecticut River. Something about how the water channels run that creates a suction kind of current. I am a great swimmer and would never go in that river without a life preserver after what I just read.    He probably has the market for this sewn up.

What I meant - and I shouldn't have to spell this out- was that with the proliferation of racist sites in the dark corners that people like this kid can get all the support he needs on his way to some hellish act or another.

From his manifesto:  I was not raised in a racist home or environment......The event that truly awakened me was the Trayvon Martin case. I kept hearing and seeing his name, and eventually I decided to look him up. I read the Wikipedia article and right away I was unable to understand what the big deal was. It was obvious that Zimmerman was in the right. But more importantly this prompted me to type in the words black on White crime into Google, and I have never been the same since that day. The first website I came to was the Council of Conservative Citizens.   There were pages upon pages of these brutal black on White murders. I was in disbelief. At this moment I realized that something was very wrong. How could the news be blowing up the Trayvon Martin case while hundreds of these black on White murders got ignored?   From this point I researched deeper and found out what was happening in Europe. I saw that the same things were happening in England and France, and in all the other Western European countries. Again I found myself in disbelief.  http://lastrhodesian.com/data/documents/rtf88.txt   This is really a climate change joke in disguise.   I have just watched a couple of these and they were so cringe-worthy I could barely stand it.  One that sticks out was this harridan owner who was just horrible to her help and her husband.

Exactly what I was pointing out in this post. Fuckers.   You mean like the guy shot in the back?   It amazes me that they aren't starting any desal operations on the west coast.  If return of salt is a problem, melt in the arctic is adding too much fresh water- I am sure barges can take salt north and slowly add it.

I don't talk to people who support the KKK.  Bill Clinton:  **Longest economic expansion in American history**  The President's strategy of fiscal discipline, open foreign markets and investments in the American people helped create the conditions for a record 115 months of economic expansion. Our economy has grown at an average of 4 percent per year since 1993.  **More than 22 million new jobs**  More than 22 million jobs were created in less than eight years -- the most ever under a single administration, and more than were created in the previous twelve years.  **Highest homeownership in American history**  A strong economy and fiscal discipline kept interest rates low, making it possible for more families to buy homes. The homeownership rate increased from 64.2 percent in 1992 to 67. 7 percent, the highest rate ever.  **Lowest unemployment in 30 years**  Unemployment dropped from more than 7 percent in 1993 to just 4.0 percent in November 2000. Unemployment for African Americans and Hispanics fell to the lowest rates on record, and the rate for women is the lowest in more than 40 years.  **Raised education standards, increased school choice, and doubled education and training investment**  Since 1992, reading and math scores have increased for 4th, 8th, and 12th graders, math SAT scores are at a 30-year high, the number of charter schools has grown from 1 to more than 2,000, forty-nine states have put in place standards in core subjects and federal investment in education and training has doubled.  **Largest expansion of college opportunity since the GI Bill**  President Clinton and Vice President Gore have nearly doubled financial aid for students by increasing Pell Grants to the largest award ever, expanding Federal Work-Study to allow 1 million students to work their way through college, and by creating new tax credits and scholarships such as Lifetime Learning tax credits and the HOPE scholarship. At the same time, taxpayers have saved $18 billion due to the decline in student loan defaults, increased collections and savings from the direct student loan program.  **Family and Medical Leave Act for 20 million Americans**  To help parents succeed at work and at home, President Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act in 1993. Over 20 million Americans have taken unpaid leave to care for a newborn child or sick family member.  **Smallest welfare rolls in 32 years**  The President pledged to end welfare as we know it and signed landmark bipartisan welfare reform legislation in 1996. Since then, caseloads have been cut in half, to the lowest level since 1968, and millions of parents have joined the workforce. People on welfare today are five times more likely to be working than in 1992.  **Higher incomes at all levels**  After falling by nearly $2,000 between 1988 and 1992, the median family's income rose by $6,338, after adjusting for inflation, since 1993. African American family income increased even more, rising by nearly $7,000 since 1993. After years of stagnant income growth among average and lower income families, all income brackets experienced double-digit growth since 1993. The bottom 20 percent saw the largest income growth at 16.3 percent.   Signs? No idea. In Panama City Beach (for instance) they have flagpoles up and down the beaches - Green flag for ok, Yellow for caution and Red means "do not get in the water", either rip tide, jellyfish outbreak or sharks spotted.   They also go up and down the beach with 4 wheelers and megaphones and tell everyone to get out of the water.   I am just stunned that they *left the beach open after an attack.*    Been a year and a half. I think of my husband every single day and probably cry once a week, still. I am still shocked sometimes that he is not here.    Fact.   And the white conservative motherfuckers hated him for it too.   The main issue is the dying middle class. People working two jobs just to get by don't have time or energy for leisure activities like fish keeping, nor the funds.    Both of them belong on /r/punchablefaces - right up there with Joffrey.   And that is the real entitlement group.   I tried to sell it to Mexico for a nickel. They wouldn't take it.   A lot comes down to them from the Sierra Snowpack- which we haven't had much of the past two years.   I wish our police in the US were like you guys, honestly, you are the best.   Borage is beautiful. It always reminded me of purple, fuzzy shooting star (dodecathion). They look adorable planted in clumps with each other in a cottagescape.   Absolutely nothing that can impact human lives, health and freedom- from prisons to hospitals to utilities (like your water supply) should ever, ever depend on a profit motive.    Some people will sell their mothers for profit- *your health or freedom means absolutely nothing to them.*   This is kind of dependent on where you are. The farther north you go the wetter it is. Or used to be.   All day? Used to take weeks to get those.   I listened to a speech (was interpreted by a friend) of an Indian Sociologist that counsels business. And most of what I got out of it was that they were outbreeding the rest of the world and had planned on beating China.   And unfortunately, according to him, the schools are basically college mills that do not have the level of education as depicted on their diplomas. As long as you can pay for your semesters- you get a degree.   If I were a main stockholder of Activision/Blizzard and had dropped in to the forums anytime in the past two months- I would be making some phone calls and setting some folks hair on fire.   The Pitchforks are Coming .. for us Plutocrats. By plutocrat Nick Hanauer.    Seeing where things are headed is the essence of entrepreneurship. And what do I see in our future now?    I see pitchforks.    But the problem isnt that we have inequality. Some inequality is intrinsic to any high-functioning capitalist economy. The problem is that inequality is at historically high levels and getting worse every day. Our country is rapidly becoming less a capitalist society and more a feudal society. Unless our policies change dramatically, the middle class will disappear, and we will be back to late 18th-century France. Before the revolution.    And so I have a message for my fellow filthy rich, for all of us who live in our gated bubble worlds: Wake up, people. It wont last.    If we dont do something to fix the glaring inequities in this economy, the pitchforks are going to come for us. No society can sustain this kind of rising inequality. In fact, there is no example in human history where wealth accumulated like this and the pitchforks didnt eventually come out. **You show me a highly unequal society, and I will show you a police state. Or an uprising. There are no counterexamples. None. Its not if, its when.**     Read more: http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/the-pitchforks-are-coming-for-us-plutocrats-108014.html#ixzz3dHBWp2tf    Just don't be Jorah Mormont.    They say they've doubled their work force for WoW. Where is it? It's sure not showing.  I have been worried that they contracted a 3rd world code sweatshop operation to save money and their 'new devs' are possibly all people who have never been able to afford to play the game.   This would be the "HP effect" in action.    Wow.. good thing they hired those 250 new 'devs'.    Not sure if it was the bitching (although I am sure that was a big part of it) so much as the leaving. I'll be interested in the numbers when they come out.   Come to think of it.. I'm not sure if I have actually seen WoD plate gear. If so, it wasn't memorable.

When we bought, we didnt plan on getting a place that looks like were living in an African savanna.  Whine. While Pacific islanders are losing their homes and land to rising seas, most of Bangladesh is flooding, people already in dire poverty are fleeing with what they can strap on their backs and oh my your lawn is brown. Heavens to betsy!   Maybe these asshats should have thought about all of this back when they first heard about Climate Change and put some of that wealth to good use investing in renewables.    And so it begins. If they get away with segregating water for lawns according to elite status, then that will set a precedent for clean drinking water down the road. And don't doubt they will have the same attitude about it.    20 years ago if I had seen someone write something like that I would have thought they were mentally disabled.

They left the beach open? Florida beaches close at just the sighting of a shark- let alone an attack. What kind of insanity is this?   They need sued to the ground for leaving the beach open after the first attack.

    The kind of revolution I want isn't just a change in leadership where we have some bloody fight and a new leader assumes his or her place at the top of the pyramid. Then we go back to the same old structure where people are basically slaves mindlessly plugging in to the machine. What interests me is the kind of revolution that happens when people wake up to the power they already have, the power that is inside of every human being, power that can't be taken away in a real sense - power that those at the top can only trick us into believing we don't have by using illusion and scare tactics. The revolution I want is one where people stop feeling scared all the time, where we feel like we have to wait around for permission from our superiors before we take action. I think this revolution is already here for many people. It will really take off when kids realize they don't have to pay a fortune to go to college for four years, that instead they can talk their way into jobs or else they can start their own careers. This revolution happens every time people take charge of their own lives, start getting in touch with their creative selves and the community around them. It'll happen when people start paying more interest to local politics than they do to the BS of Presidential politics. This revolution happens when people organize rent strikes, when they learn how to grow their own food. The truth is we don't need a Revolution. We need 300 million revolutions.   I would imagine there is wild variation between different subs for gender. Conspiracy seems pretty male, but then again I don't really know.   The Reader's Picks are always so much smarter than the NYT picks.    My post isn't really about Ellen Pao, it's about New York Times bias.       I hope someone hears this 500 years from now and thinks "God music used to be really good back then."   That was great. Really strong playing.   That's the nice thing about waking up. People who wake up never have to be bored ever again.      Well the shit we're in isn't something we can escape easily, but the number of mindless sheep is dwindling in my estimation. Just look at this site. A lot of trivial shit to be sure, but also a lot of increasingly radical opinions popping up in unexpected subs. There are comments sections of papers where people commenting have things figured out to a degree that the journalists writing the articles still haven't. 90% of people are basically asleep, but 10% aren't and that equates to a fuckload of people. And after all, how many do you need awake to have a revolution? Not 100% Maybe 15 to 20 % would do the trick. It's coming. You want proof? Check out the security measures the super wealthy are taking. They're scared.   I'm really not sure it was a failure at all. People see common ground now on issues like the NSA and civil liberties where we would have got bogged down in semantic bullshit before. We've started to look past left and right/ Fox news vs MSNBC contrived divisions. I have a lot of hope that our time is coming. The Empire is looking nervous.   Me and my folks were in two different states outside of New York state. One woman was in Brooklyn sharing with people. A guy in Virginia. Like I said, doors open, drawers open, nothing missing. Not NYPD in my opinion. The NYPD was present at the park but there were a lot of other weird people sniffing around. I had my photo taken more or less constantly while I was there. People kept using different ploys to get my name and biographical data/ address etc.   My place and my folks the same day in different cities. A couple of people I met there had it happen to them too. I found this out later, my wife was still in our place. Could be coincidence but it freaked me out a bit at the time.   The police did so much dirty shit, it was impossible to keep up. They went around telling drug addicts all over Manhattan that they should head to Zuccotti Park so they could get free food and clothes. The place filled up with junkies and then the media got to film it and say look at all these dirty protestors. A lot of the cops were sympathetic but then some group would show up with orders to intimidate people, driving motorcycles through groups of people on the sidewalk trying to provoke a reaction. There were a bunch of weird break ins in apartments right around that time where nothing was stolen, drawers gone through.   Seriously. They used the classic COINTELPRO playbook to break it up.   [William Sargant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sargant)      That mix was basically my experience of Occupy at ground level. Don't believe anything you read about it. It was incredibly diverse when I was there. Lots of Anarchists, Libertarians, old hippies, young people, families, every economic class from richest to poorest. It was really wild.  And what happened was we got harassed out of existence by a bunch of nasty cops and infiltrators.   Because it is! It's also got a really good collection of  literature about the legal history of drugs. I'll be a little sad if they ever update the site.   For example: The DEA's Mission Statement and then the Schaeffer response to it:  **DEA's  Statement**: The mission of the Drug Enforcement Administration is to enforce the controlled substances laws and regulations of the United States and to bring to the criminal and civil justice system of the United States or any other competent jurisdiction, those organizations, and principal members of organizations, involved in the growing, manufacture, or distribution of controlled substances appearing in or destined for illicit traffic in the United States; and to recommend and support nonenforcement programs aimed at reducing the availability of illicit controlled substances on the domestic and international markets.  **Schaeffer response**: That's a nice sounding statement, but the mission of the drug enforcement authorities in the United States has never been quite that simple.  The truth is that the DEA and its predecessors were primarily the result of the most cynical political ploys, and the history of these agencies is among the dirtiest and most ridiculous chapters of American history.   For some good examples of this, we invite you read the many Historical References, particularly Professor Whitebread's Piece, The History of the Non-Medical Use of Drug in the United States, as well as the historical portions of   The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs, and Dan Baum's excellent work on modern history, Smoke and Mirrors.

I'm starting to form the opinion that they're a kind of intelligence service for hire for corporations? A kind of intelligence version of Blackwater/Xe/Academi/whatever those people are calling themselves this week.  Worryingly, Stratfor seems to do a lot of investigation of activists and activist communities. Are there others like them out there? Are they into manipulating public opinion on popular message boards?   And Chinese and corporations. Etc... there is a lot of BS we have to swim through to get to reality.

Great writer. Try this: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3cpb5u/   I would argue that the average person's eyes were more open forty years ago. Watergate and the Church committee revelations about MKULTRA not to mention the weirdness of Jonestown made a lot of people open their eyes to the darkness around them. For all the advantages of the internet, it can be an information tsunami that buries stuff that might wake people up. I think right at this moment, the powers that be are tightening their grip on info which has the twin effect of making info harder to come by but also of making it more precious. Arguably, the average Soviet intellectual used to be better informed about the KGB because of samizdat (illicitly passed around documents and information) than Americans currently are about the goings on of the NSA, the CIA, Stratfor etc... The depth of knowledge of American students about the CIA's activities in Vietnam and globally back in the pre-internet era was little short of astonishing for its bredth and accuracy.   John Judge was another one of my heroes. I wish everyone on this sub could read his article [The Black Hole of Guyana](http://www.ratical.org/ratville/JFK/JohnJudge/Jonestown.html). I'm sure you already know it. This is the article that probably sent me down the rabbit hole in the first place! Unless you count the  pictures of the massacre in Jonestown that were placed in newspapers when I was a kid.   More on Sharon Tate's father Paul Tate from [Miles Williams Mathis' fascinating site](http://mileswmathis.com/tate.pdf)   Paul Tate  All that is suggestive, but the biggest red flag in this whole charade is that Sharon's father Paul Tate was a  colonel in army intelligence.      That rank is just under general.  They don't tell us exactly in what capacity  he served, of course, but they do admit he served for 23 years, (supposedly) ending in 1969.  So he started  in 1946.  Interestingly, that is when army intelligence was split into various departments, including the  CIA.  Yes, the CIA started in 1947.     In 1959, the Tates moved to Verona, Italy, where Paul Tate was stationed at Passalacqua, the headquarters  for SETAF (Southern European Task Force).  This links him to   Operation Gladio  .  General Maletti  commander of Italian military intelligence at the time of the Tate murderslater testified in court that  the CIA had been involved in many false flag operations in Italy and Europe, including murders and  bombings, for the purpose of creating an Italian nationalism that was capable of halting what it saw as a  slide to the left.  Sound familiar?  Maletti added, Don't forget that Nixon was in charge and Nixon was a  strange man, a very intelligent politician but a man of rather unorthodox initiatives.  Nixon was in charge  in 1969, but Operation Gladio had been instituted by Allen Dulles much earlier, and it was financed in  large part by the US, through the CIA, which Dulles led under Eisenhower and Kennedy (1953 to late  1961).  The Operation kicked into high gear in the late 50's to counter growing leftist movements,  especially in Italy.  We must assume that is why Paul Tate was in Verona in 1959 with his family.  Paul Tate  was not just military, he was a colonel in intelligence, which indicates he was probably involved in Gladio.  One of these Gladio false flags was the Piazza Fontana bombing of 1969, just a few months after the  alleged Tate murders.  The bombing was initially attributed to anarchists (violent hippies, you know), but  it later came out in testimony like that of General Maletti that these bombings were really the work of the  CIA, in league with other European intelligence agencies.   This indicates that Sharon Tate's own father  was capable of organizing false flag events, and knew others who could help with whatever needed to be  done, including faking deaths and pinning them on leftists.  You may think of the Tate murders as just  one more Gladio false flag operation against the left.   Yes, the Manson murders were an instance of  Gladio moving to the US.   We should pool together and do a superbowl ad. That could be fun.    We could use a Mae Brussell these days. Do you think she was killed? She was getting really deep into Michael Aquino stuff and satanic ritual abuse before she died.   They won't even let Graham Hancock speak, so I doubt they'll bee too keen on things that veer into MKULTRA, CHAOS, COINTELPRO etc... Who is behind Ted anyway? I'm not against them, but I would like to know more about their aims.   In other words, he ate his last meal with two of the victim's of the Manson family, the director of Rosemary's Baby - a movie about Satanic ritual - and another director who made the Manchurian Candidate - a movie about mind control. This was his company in the final hours of his life before he was killed, reputedly by a victim of mind control. Sharon Tate's father, incidentally, was a Colonel in Army Intelligence from 1946 to 1969.      It's this chart that scares me in particular: [How humans interact with one another, particularly online](https://prod01-cdn03.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2014/02/screenshot14.png). Notice the prominent place for the concept of magic at the top.      There are multiple sources for the police claims but it's in Ed Sanders book The Family.    Communist Jesus wants to believe that he doesn't exist, but he just can't accept the party's doctrine on this matter.   I saw that. The picture of Crosby and his dad cracks me up for some reason.   Amazing info, thanks! And not to forget, Frank Zappa's dad worked at Edgewood Arsenal making chemical weapons.   What's your opinion of this theory Dave McGowan wrote about in Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon that the whole hippy/summer of love phenomenon was basically a synthetic creation by the CIA to subdue the antiwar movement?   [The story of Essiac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jojYLUwSjhI)   This stuff is very interesting though it draws conclusions that go beyond my own:   The CIA had its own version of COINTELPRO, called CHAOS.  Again, this is not a conspiracy theory, it is  now admitted by the CIA.    It is known that CHAOS   was started by Johnson in 1967 and then expanded by  Nixon in 1969.  It was directed by Richard Helms and run by the notorious James Jesus Angleton.  Nixon  also linked COINTELPRO and CHAOS.  It went into its tightest security mode in July of 1969, the month  before the Tate murders.   Seymour Hersh blew the whistle on CHAOS in a 1974   New York Times   article.  Since the   NYT   is controlled by the CIA, we must assume this was mainly damage control: the admission of  lesser crimes to cover larger ones.   One of the larger ones remaining hidden until now is the control of  the Tate murders.   If Hersh really knew anything about CHAOS, he would have known of its premier  operation, successful beyond all imagining.   But Hersh's articles never once mention the Tate murders.  This is why I say his articles were misdirection.  They hinted at many things, but gave you nothing  concrete.  The hints all pushed you toward smaller things, which acted as further cover for the big things  like the Tate operation.        The thing I've never been able to get my head around was the fact that a felon, on parole, who was known to be harboring run away teen girls, who was accused repeatedly of everything from theft to rape, how was it the police never arrested him before the murders? He was violating so many of the terms of his parole that he could have been sent away for many years without formal charges for crimes. Ordinary people would have been arrested, but the LAPD never touched him. Cops from LA later claimed they were being held back from arresting him. By who?      That's astonishing. Massachusetts and Boston in particular was a real center of this stuff. I'm really starting to feel like LSD was just a giant mind hack by the CIA.   Thanks for that!   I also think they chose him specifically because he was Polish and they were interested in seeing how they could manipulate and break people with an Eastern European background using psychological techniques.   Do you have a link for that?   I definitely think McVeigh was  trained using an advanced version of MKULTRA. Unfortunately the one thing that changed over the years was the ability of these people to cover their tracks so we'll likely never know what happened with McVeigh. We do know a great deal about Kaczynski. Henry Murray conducted the experiments on him at Harvard. These experiments were designed to break young people. All of the participants were considered vulnerable because they came from working class backgrounds and were thus subjected to the immense snobbery of Harvard. Here's an extract from Alston Chase's book:   The Murray Experiment    PERHAPS no figure at Harvard at this time better embodied the ongoing war between science and humanism than Henry A. "Harry" Murray, a professor in Harvard's Department of Social Relations. A wealthy and blue-blooded New Yorker, Murray was both a scientist and a humanist, and he was one of Lewis Mumford's best friends. He feared for the future of civilization in an age of nuclear weapons, and advocated implementing the agenda of the World Federalist Association, which called for a single world government. The atomic bomb, Murray wrote in a letter to Mumford, "is the logical   predictable result of the course we have been madly pursuing for a hundred years." The choice now facing humanity, he added, was "One World or No World." Yet unlike Mumford, Murray maintained a deep faith in science. He saw it as offering a solution by helping to transform the human personality. "The kind of behavior that is required by the present threat," Murray wrote Mumford, "involves transformations of personality such as never occurred quickly in human history; one transformation being that of National Man into World Man." Crucial to achieving this change was learning the secret of successful relationships between people, communities, and nations. And coming to understand these "unusually successful relations" was the object of Murray's particular research: the interplay between two individuals, which he called the "dyad."    The concept of the dyad was, in a sense, Murray's attempt to build a bridge between psychology and sociology. Rather than follow Freud and Jung by identifying the individual as the fundamental atom in the psychological universe, Murray chose the dyad -- the smallest social unit -- and in this way sought to unite psychiatry, which studied the psyches of individuals, and sociology, which studied social relations. This kind of research, he apparently hoped, might (as he put it in a 1947 paper) promote "the survival and further evaluation of Modern Man, "by encouraging the emergence of the new "world man" and making world peace more likely.    Murray's interest in the dyad, however, may have been more than merely academic. The curiosity of this complex man appears to have been impelled by two motives -- one idealistic and the other somewhat less so. He lent his talents to national aims during World War II. Forrest Robinson, the author of a 1992 biography of Murray, wrote that during this period he "flourished as a leader in the global crusade of good against evil." He was also an advocate of world government. Murray saw understanding the dyad, it seems, as a practical tool in the service of the great crusade in both its hot and cold phases. (He had long shown interest, for example, in the whole subject of brainwashing.) During the war Murray served in the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA, helping to develop psychological screening tests for applicants and (according to Timothy Leary) monitoring military experiments on brainwashing. In his book (1979), John Marks reported that General "Wild Bill" Donovan, the OSS director, "called in Harvard psychology professor Henry 'Harry' Murray" to devise a system for testing the suitability of applicants to the OSS. Murray and his colleagues "put together an assessment system ... [that] tested a recruit's ability to stand up under pressure, to be a leader, to hold liquor, to lie skillfully, and to read a person's character by the nature of his clothing.... Murray's system became a fixture in the OSS."    One of the tests that Murray devised for the OSS was intended to determine how well applicants withstood interrogations. As he and his colleagues described it in their 1948 report "Selection of Personnel for Clandestine Operations -- Assessment of Men,"        The candidate immediately went downstairs to the basement room. A voice from within commanded him to enter, and on complying he found himself facing a spotlight strong enough to blind him for a moment. The room was otherwise dark. Behind the spotlight sat a scarcely discernible board of inquisitors.... The interrogator gruffly ordered the candidate to sit down. When he did so, he discovered that the chair in which he sat was so arranged that the full strength of the beam was focused directly on his face....        At first the questions were asked in a quiet, sympathetic, conciliatory manner, to invite confidence.... After a few minutes, however, the examiner worked up to a crescendo in a dramatic fashion.... When an inconsistency appeared, he raised his voice and lashed out at the candidate, often with sharp sarcasm. He might even roar, "You're a liar."    Even anticipation of this test was enough to cause some applicants to fall apart. The authors wrote that one person "insisted he could not go through with the test." They continued, "A little later the director ... found the candidate in his bedroom, sitting on the edge of his cot, sobbing."    Before the war Murray had been the director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic. After the war Murray returned to Harvard, where he continued to refine techniques of personality assessment. In 1948 he sent a grant application to the Rockefeller Foundation proposing "the development of a system of procedures for testing the suitability of officer candidates for the navy." By 1950 he had resumed studies on Harvard undergraduates that he had begun, in rudimentary form, before the war, titled "Multiform Assessments of Personality Development Among Gifted College Men." The experiment in which Kaczynski participated was the last and most elaborate in the series. In their postwar form these experiments focused on stressful dyadic relations, designing confrontations akin to those mock interrogations he had helped to orchestrate for the OSS.         This is in German with subs but it's the most interesting documentary I've seen on Kaczynski. The book Harvard and the Unabomber is also well worth a read.                           P-Funk is the elite's true enemy.               Anyone who has ever done extensive research into the Vietnam War has come across all of these myths that people will swear up and down really happened. A common and very surreal one is the myth of [vagina dentata](http://www.insaneasylumblog.com/2011/01/fyi-she-bites-unless-you-like-that.html#axzz3fFgUxRE9).   The last couple of Fukushima stories I posted had an astonishing number of downvotes, so let's see how this one goes.                        	92
 Something else to keep in mind is depending on where you live you may be required by law (depending on total value of damage) to report that to the Police/DMV/MVA...   Yeah.  The bottom bolt was oily and harder to break free than the rest but I got it out.  Was afraid it was cross threaded because it was tight all the way out but it wasn't thank the car gods.  So it's take out all three bolts, use a long flathead screw driver to pry the stock plate off, clean off the mating surface with brake cleaner (and a razor blade if there's any RTV residue), dab some Permatex ultra grey on the parting lines between the cylinder and head (top and bottom), rub some oil on the new plate's gasket, then mount up the new plate and finger tighten the screws; come back after an hour and torque it to spec.  Then, let cure for 24 hours.  I'm sure it also helps that I have a lithium battery that's less than half the size of the stocker too.  Gives a lot more space to work.  Here's the new plate:  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/nuz6XQ8.jpg)   Unsmooth?  What...does that even mean?  Can you use a few more words to describe what you actually experienced?  You also still haven't said if it was new or used?  Guessing used based on the steering wheel comment.   I read it in this voice:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NF5XU-k2Vk t=1m27s   Ah, but will it blend?  THAT is THE question.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_hypersensitivity   No: S'all good, man.   Apparently it means "disturbed" in Japanese.  http://www.tanoshiijapanese.com/dictionary/entry_details.cfm?entry_id=53012 element_id=67647  (make sure "Show Romaji" is checked near the top right)   I did the Raceseng plate install tonight.  Link below is my stock plate.  As a reminder, 2014 w/2014 build date; daily driver; naturally aspirated; about 8200 mi.  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/0nyqcVG.jpg)   The low resolution is really inhibiting ability to read the documents and screen but given the Einstein poster and book "Quarks" I'm going with physics student in addition to the other comments I've read.     Speaking as a production engineer, it's an absolutely shit thing Subaru has done with that plate.  It's a manual process with liquid materials and those are things you just don't do if they can be avoided, and it easily could've been based on the design and what was to be accomplished.  They'd have saved on labor if they had fine it with a plug and gasket, even if the parts were slightly more expensive.   It's actually stamped steel.   My daily driver naturally aspirated 2014 with 8,000 miles in it leaks from the cam plate like crazy.  But it's been too cold for me to install the Raceseng plate I bought.   So I'm sitting at DFW on a layover.  C terminal if you're familiar.  Anyway, there are two sets of wall plugs where I'm sitting.  Only one set works.  People keep coming up and plugging in to the bad one and their charger falls right back out.  Try again, falls out.  Try other plug, falls out.  I've seen this repeat ten times so far.  It's kind of amusing.  Mostly i devices but one BlackBerry, for those wondering.  Am I the only person with an external battery pack?  I have an LG G3 though...   My stock 1000RR would hit 83 in first, but I've long since geared it down.   In MD it depends on the county...St. Mary's has no emissions requirements.   28 F in MD and raining ice.  Y'all got any more of that spring?   The outside diameter of the tire is typically kept the same when you go up or down in wheel size. So it'd fill the same amount of space in your wheel well.  It won't look any more or less like a monster truck than it does now.   31-33?  With an automatic maybe.  I'm sitting at just about 24 average over 8000 miles with my 6MT.  And yes, a supercharger increases volumetric efficiency so if you can stay out of the throttle you'll see the mileage go up slightly.  I experienced this on my GTO.  I actually was going to post this when I saw this thread this morning but figured some know nothing would downvote it into oblivion.  Guess I was right...   Why would anyone want to risk starting off the darkest timeline?   I just...don't even know what to say about this.  It snowed four inches overnight.  It's still snowing here.  Last week we had a night of 8 inches.  Second winter where I live and I've never seen a single person driving with chains on.  And you're doing this just in case for the one day it might snow an inch in Atlanta?  I...I don't get it?   Thunderstruck.   Exactly what I was going to suggest.  Do it with gas cylinders, water hoses, tires...escaping gas or fluid will always bubble :)  That's how I figured out one of my motorcycle tires was installed incorrectly years ago.  Lots of bubbles around the bead.  Works for gas grills, washing machines...you name it.   Wait, so did you get full on new headlight assemblies to in that $500?  I assumed based on the pictures you had a 10 Series or a Monogram.   I've been running a single exit Berk muffler delete since last May.  Yep, she's a daily driver.  But I'm deaf so it doesn't bother me one bit - I like hearing what I can of it.  Long term it's probably EL headers and an FBM single exit 3" system.   And that's why I haven't done it yet.  For the price you could do so many different potential performance things.  I definitely understand the appeal though.   That is not accurate.  There are plenty of phones that have no known exploits.   Let's make my 2017 plan a 2016 or heck a 2015 plan, howsabout it?   When did I say it was adequate?  I'm actively working to increase the horsepower of my FR-S.  But that's just what I do.  I used to have a 600 hp 04 GTO...   Check your PMs.   Um, you realize the portion of the graph that is increasing is horsepower, not torque, right?  The graph that's basically flat at 135 wtq with a dip in the 3-4.5k region is the torque graph.  That is a pretty flat torque curve.  Over 4000 RPM it varies less than 10%...Pretty much the definition of flat.   The torque curve is pretty much flat from 2500 to peak.  It's hardly "narrow".  It could definitely be higher for the masses though.  http://www.ft86club.com/forums/showthread.php?t=10366   This is the internet; it's not a dinner party at Grandma's.  Get over yourself.

Not here in the boonies.   Magnuson Moss protects from losing warranty - they can't just cancel it.  Contrary to what the article said.  The article was a useful brief on Ford Racing parts, nothing more.  And yes, of course the aftermarket will be better. That wasn't my point, which seems to be lost on you for whatever reason...   Yes, I believe that's true.   That's funny - I know plenty of people who survived on their stock summer tires just fine through last year's above average snow fall here in Maryland.  My FR-S on the other hand does just great on the Hankook s-1 noble 2s that I swapped to back in November from the stock Michelins.   I would never limit myself to OE parts.  But for those people who think changing your air filter voids your warranty, there is Ford Racing.  Or TRD, STi, AMG...   There are plenty of vehicles that come with summer tires.  Every Audi with a sport package, the WRX STi, Corvettes, Camaros, Mustang performance packs, Focus ST, Fiesta ST, all Porsches, the Genesis Coupe...basically any sports or sporty car.   They all have different wheels as well...   http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/buying-maintenance/news/a24602/ford-racing-really-wants-you-to-mod-ecoboost-engines/  You were saying something about no warranty?   Release Series is yellow...   What's "a normal car"?  The twins, like any other two wheel drive car, do just fine when equipped with tires appropriate for the weather and when they're not tracking through snow or water deeper than the front bumper...   Sounds like either you are running too low an offset or you need an alignment or both.   That car was actually made by the owner of streetfx...   This can happen with extreme drops (or lifts, actually) on any vehicle.  Keep it around an inch and you'll be fine.   I have Swift Sport springs coming for my FR-S.  I did get the BRZ model though, part number ending in 12.  One inch drop, substantially higher spring rates but still appropriate for stock struts based on my reading.  I wanted RCE yellows originally but couldn't justify the substantial extra cost, and the Swifts will allow a bit more tailwagging action than the RCEs (though will be much more surefooted than stock).  I got the BRZ version for the higher front spring rate - the FR-S version front/back ratio was only marginally higher than stock and I did want to add more stability.   Yes, but there's a difference between offering full service and there being a state law forbidding regular folks from pumping their own, as in Oregon and New Jersey.   After reading the comments I feel like I must be the only person here without a positive response.  Why exactly do you need a brand new sportscar as a sophomore or junior in college without (guessing since you mentioned parents) the means to pay for it on your own?   Why is this a surprise?  It's no different than lowering the resolution on a desktop PC before loading up a poorly done console port...   You can also do full custom dyno tuning with OFT just like with any other tuner.  The OFT in that case just acts as the interface to get the tune into the car, like the ECUTek cable.  But unlike ECUTek you can go back later and modify OFT tunes on your own.  ECUTek doesn't allow the enduser to do that.   I saw this yesterday too.  The 70% off thing is a scam.  The manufacturer sells this thing direct for $22; not whatever ridiculous before price Newegg has posted.   You did a great job.  Once the weather warms up here I'm planning on doing a metallic gunmetal on my stock wheels.  I think it'll look good against the white body and be different from the usual flat black.   What size spacers are you running?  Looks good.   Never owned a Mustang.  The whole point of there being a law though means you have to be willing to stand up for yourself rather than just roll over and accept the warranty being cancelled.  Otherwise the law has no power.  Of course some huge company will try to tell a consumer is wrong.  It's up to the consumer to fight back though.  Because companies don't give a damn about individual customers. Never have, never will.  If you're not willing to fight for your rights then you don't deserve them.   Yeah and with our luck it'll be in an Accord   Been modding cars for 11 years...hasn't happened yet.   Purple nurple!   Protip: revisit how warranties get voided.  It's not an automatic thing, and there are federal laws to help consumers.  Also, only an FR-S RS 1.0 ever cost over $30K.   Correct, it is not yet confirmed.   Civic will be much more expensive - the Si is in the same ballpark price wise.  The Miata only overlaps slightly - the majority of folks are buying them for top down weekend GTing, not for modding and autoX.   I find it amusing the people who think Scion has a boy racer image and Subaru doesn't.  WRX STi with the 12" tall wing on the back, hello?

You actually swap the whole thing out, not just the lens.  I haven't done it myself yet.  Ft86speedfactory, rallysportdirect, maperformance can all hook you up (and others).   There's a red Elise in my parking garage at work.   Or you could just get switchbacks.  No wiring mods required.   There is no both, his car doesn't have fogs.  The lights on the front under the headlights are the marker lights and front turn signals.  Foglights on this car replace the vent below that.  The lights by the wheels are basically the same thing - sidemarkers.   Gaskets are an easy fix...  http://gasketninja.com   You're better off doing some free weight removal than spending that tiny amount of money.  That said...

Also, forget the crush washers - get a Fumoto or Stahlbus oil pan bolt/drain valve and never deal with taking the bolt out again.   To answer your main question, anything that fits a 2013 will fit a 2014 and vice versa.  There's a few bolts that are different in the suspension, that's about it.  2015 change the dampers and probably a few more bolts.  And of course the antenna and a few colors.

Only reason I mentioned the sticker was I had a similar setup on my prior Ram and it didn't last very long at all on the back window before it just came off one day (I had it in the middle slidey portion).  The window seals on the the Twins aren't the greatest so it probably doesn't apply that much pressure.   The only problem is, when it returns to freezing temps later this week, all that water that seeped past your window seals and down into the inside-outside of your doors will freeze your window motors right up until it warms up again.

Alien says "because, we want to" then he gets them said raccoon and the aliens leave  The actual scene: we go back to the aliens in their ship and there's a mini montage of hacking and slicing stitching etc... But then the raccoon awakes and the aliens look over it all amazed and shit, and we cut to the raccoon and its revealed to be rocket from GOTG, and then rocket reacts "oh why do I feel different, and why am I speaking?" Fade to black   not according to acdc-1989 and his supposed followers   i came to the conclusion that daniel craig haters are sociopaths, i enjo them but whenever someone critisises them they gather in a group, making me feel like an outcast. and worse yet theres a user on imdb that copies and pastes the same criticism over and over again, i want him to die, and he goes by acdc-1989 hes probably the leader of the daniel craig haters, hes probably having a rally as we speak, and theyre probably burning a daniel craig dummy on a string and poking it with spears. and theyre probably planning on burning down dvd sections in all targets, walmarts, kmarts, etc. and get this, Bump, is their slogan probably, because acdc-1989 starts a topic and just says bump the other self posts. all im saying is as soon as you find out someones a daniel craig hater. stop being friends with them immediately, theyre evil and heartless, thank you, if theres a valid reason why i shouldnt like the daniel craig james bond movies please state why please      search.yahoo.com/search?fr=mcafee type=B210US0D20111102 p=star+trek+weekend+udate+snl  this is the video where it started it all, now im searching for reboot haters and teaching them a lesson ever since, now you see why i hate people who dislike the reboots, its because theyre ASSHOLES!! and theyre trying to ruin jj abrams career, by doing this so i ask for all haters to stop being haters!!!! i want all criticisms to stop!!!! thank you, not any one of you will amke me not like the reboots i know your game!! you want jj abrams to suffer and bob orci and jurtzman to suffer, well i wont have it!! thats how careers get ruined. dont you see? btw i enjoyed into darkness, and no one i repeat NO ONE will try to convince me otherwise, you may be thinking "but people have different opinions" Adolf hitler had an OPINION, kkk members have an OPINION, terrorists have OPINIONS. People have been telling me that for years and it's brought me nothing but misery, so I'm warning you Star Trek reboot haters, I'm on to you, someday I'll catch you all having a rally burning a jj Abrams dummy on a string and poking it with spears, and lynching a reboot fan, LIKE ME!! So don't be surprised if I report you to a hate crime division   well in that case i see your imgur image and a raise you:  http://youtu.be/YRWUeUK6kKQ   whats the context of you posting that image? is it my rambling or my (apparent) nonsense   reboot haters are forming an underground group, planning an attack against bad robot and all involved, they may be planning on an attack on, reboot fans AS WE SPEAK!! you may be thinking ''youve been watching too many marvel movies'' but it could happen   i mean i wouldnt be surprised if reboot haters formed a kkk-esque group, where they lynch and burn reboot fans! or have nazi-esque rallys   and btw im not orci, im just a really frustrated person who enjoys movies   but theres people like you being an ungrateful shit!! i mean it got rave reviews for christs sake, you only need to be literate to see that!!its not rocket science      look all im saying is treat people who like the reboots like you would want to be treated, dont treat them like lesser human beings.   You sure you and other reboot haters don't meet in an underground arena to hold rally's where your unnamed leader gives anti reboot speeches. And you salute him a la' the nazis   I Mean whenever someone insults the reboots I just wish a painful death upon them. And I don't know why, it's like will thy be that way forever? I mean you may be saying "why are you wasting your breath saying some few people didn't like a movie?" Well before you respond to that, is it true that:  a) reboot haters are sociopaths  b)burn jj Abrams effigies kinda like the KKK   c) lynch reboot fans also like the kkk from a speeding car  d) there's a conspiracy to destroy anyone and anything involved with the reboots?  e) reboot haters are conspiring to hack paramount   Are any of these true? Why or why not    EThink about it this way, if you were a filmmaker and someone with a terminal disease, was going to die before the films premiere, would you screen the film for them? Or would you be willing to?   Well if you'd actually watch the video, he said te patient wanted to watch it, and he enjoyed it      First, Marvel did not buy Spider-Man back. They got the right to use the character in their films and discuss with Sony how to use the character. That's very different from owning all the rights.  fuck!   like scroll down to the 'films' section  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe  i mean wtf man!? however the mcu wiki is up to date  http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Phase_Three  i mean what gives who do i believe? AND to add insult to injury check out this paragraph from the list of mcu films from wikipedia:  In December 2014, emails between Sony Pictures Entertainment Co-Chairman Amy Pascal and president Doug Belgrad were released after the November hacking of Sony's computers, stating that Sony wanted Marvel to produce a new trilogy of Spider-Man movies while Sony retains "creative control, marketing and distribution". Marvel also wanted to include Spider-Man in Captain America: Civil War. However, discussions between Sony and Marvel broke down, with Sony wanting to go ahead with its already planned slate of Spider-Man films.[284]  i mean wtf!? who do i believe? the moderator for that page is probably sipping some scotch on the rocks being entertained for his not up to date page   the boondock saints   man, the incredible hulk is the one mcu movie that gets the LEAST love   1. how will they have the daily bugle, if at all? because i dont recall any mention of the daily bugle in any previous mcu media, they'll need to introduce the daily bugle at some point, or at the very least show an adult peter parker looking back on his life, and in a flashback show a young peter parker working there and then in present day say it closed down, or something  2. if they have j. jonah jameson, how strong  will his dislike for spider man be? because if there's other superheroes he'd be totally fine with it. "i really hate spiderman!" "but sir we report on the avengers all the time, and you seem totally fine with them.'' "oh yeah, alright then no harm done.''  see what i mean?   oh yeah i saw that deviant art thing too   homestar runner - mr snrub  coach z - 'intergalactic' beastie boys member  the cheat - pikachu  strong bad - jack skellington  marzipan - the violinist from 'deus-suds and soda'  pom pom - a metroid  strong sad - zz top member  bubs - peter gabriel  strong mad - borg cube  the poopsmith - powerline   the KOT - chef boyardee  homsar - engineer from 'conjunction junction'     believe whatever you want but, this guy is a clever, imposter   this guy is tring to frame me ill report him!   the vision doesnt look too shabby   their yelp reviews must be MURDEROUS   did his character in the marvel cinematic universe get killed off, so he can be on this show?   http://youtu.be/qMVJnWd4idE  	49

 It worth mentioning that the poem is meant as a parody of shows like Opera and how self harm is considered a taboo topic.    100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Was an interesting book, very well written and wonderful world building. The ending made me pretty sad.    Stephan Dedalus from A portrait Of The Artist. May seem a masturbatory answer (oddly fitting due to the nature of the book). Just because I grew up very religious and very conflicted about my thoughts, feelings and desires. Not understanding the world. The joy and terror of being a bad person in your own eyes. Rejecting your previous beliefs once you become an adult. Deciding to pursue writing.   I like the concept and it's quite well written. I really enjoy the final line. I think it might be more effective if you placed the platitudes in bold. Or I guess you could just preface the preface the piece with an explanation. I think the piece could be more humorous and effective in other, less form heavy writing styles.

Season 2 was orgasmically good.    do you know about a beginer's guide to iv's / ev's... i'm trying to understand it and it's all pretty complicated... i tried using an ev calculator but it said i needed to know the individual ev's for each stat and i don't really know how to find it..   lvl 9 = above average, best stat is HP, fantastic stats, that's how i judge it.   lvl 4 = above average overall, best stat is defense stat, stats like that, they simply can't be beat.   lvl 11 = relatively superior potential overall, greatest potential is defense, stats like those simply can't be beat.   lvl 8 = above average overall, best is the defense stat, fantastic states, that's how he judges it.   lvl 8 = above average overall, sp. def stat is the greatest, fantastic stats is how he judges.   so... yeah... any help understanding these?   How do i look that up? Is that like the stat under HP, ATTACK, ETC..?   [6] So... here's their natures...

I want one...            /r/eaf   Walter White   Incredible   i love u guys   I miss the good seasons of this show so much... It was so incredible........... UGHHHHH   Your situation sounds a lot worse than what I saw in the film. Perhaps if I saw one of them getting kicked in the head and stomach, to the point where one of their ribs broke, I might have found the end more believable.    I really thought it was a leap to have the character actually go and kill the bullies... I mean, I don't know any school shooters but I feel they all must suffer from some sort of mental disorder to begin with.. Homicidal tendencies. I felt Matt was very warm and funny, and probably very like the actor/writer/director portraying him, so, I just didn't "feel" he was the kind of guy who would kill people who bully him. I felt he would go make a movie or do something silly. He seemed way too happy all the time to be a murderer... And he was likable to me as an audience member. when people were treating him like a weirdo nerd I thought it was a little rediculous. he wasn't weird enough for me. he seemed pretty cool actually. The only thing that sort of justified the killing for me was when he was reading about psychopaths and he read the description of them always "lying", and their entire being is just a mask, and even when the truth is easier to tell the psycho will choose to lie just for the sport of it. If he's reading about himself, his friendly personality is just hiding a deep seated blood lust that would have manifested whether it was a Dirty or somebody else... But that kind of goes against what the film was trying to do, say bullying causes [some] school shootings. I don't care how shitty the bullying he was recieving was (and really... It was bad but it wasn't crazy bad... I've seen worse), for him to kill the bullies made him a psychopath to me. He should have just toughed it out for what 1, maybe 2 more years? I had a problem with his nice guy movie lover persona just becoming a killer... I read the documentary crew being in his head which then just made me settle on him being crazy but my friends read it different. I don't think the filmmakers really knew after reading some interviews which I found very dissapointing because I think if you're going to tackle such a huge issue, you need a very powerful strategy, and in the end I'm just sitting here dissapointed after all the hype. Still a good movie, 7.5/10... OH, and the song choices were excellent, and the directing was great. Some really beautiful montages. I look forward to more from Matt Johnson.   /r/EAF      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Kyi0WNg40   As a Jew I whole heartedly endorse a team named The New York Jews with that as our mascot.    You are awesome.    I see another version of you getting a very similarly thematic tattoo in multiple universes.   fuck the game gramps little bitches   I really like it...    Just watched the movie on my xbox... Gotta say it's pretty flawed but still impressive, and hardly affective to me about how bad bullying can be... At least to me.    This place looks awesome. Where is it?   I need the show NOW.    Bidoof is a bi doof.       That was pretty hilarious.    turns out its some sort of new age meditation camp where they thought they were making forcefields... so the people around the lady who gets hit were making a forcefield around her to protect her from the guy running at her... but its not strong enough... then the guy starts shaking cause he's still affected by their forcefield..   /r/EAF   There was also a Dr. Evil version which I own.    It's true though.    Oh, hai doggie.   OMG. CAN'T WAIT.    No, I liked it, but tonally it felt like a condemnation of Walt, almost cautionary tale-esque, whereas in the new one, he won in the end... Or at least that's how I felt.    I liked it but I don't think it totally worked because Walt wanted to die in some regards, he was angry when his cancer went away, and he was laughing when he thought Gus Fring was coming to kill him and his family, thats why the more upbeat Badfinger song is like Walt going out on his own terms in a blaze of  glory.    Champion.

 Any tips on creating textured sounds? Your pretty fucking great at making really thick sounding textures man.   All it takes it a weighty flick to the centre of one of said nuts for this to never happen again..   Still a fucking v8. In the uk my first car was a 4 cylinder 1.3 litre Renault..  	3
 Thanks. I was able to go to the webpage and like there I'm in the S fund. So, I guess I'm doing something right. Following these types of models could help in moving the money were it's more profitable, right?   The reason I'm asking it's because I've heard that people move the allocations based on the stock market.    I tried looking at the model but the webpage is not working. So such models would show me where it should be best to move my allocations?   Wouldn't I lose all my money if I invested in one fund? If I don't manage them, how can I make a decision in which one to use? What should I know or be paying attention to so I can choose one that would be more profitable?   The Thrift Savings Plan.    	5
             No it's not. The article is from Scientific Reports, which is open-access.                                    Sorry. Missed that earlier one!                     You should also monitor your mental health status.                     That's true. .   That collection is... beautiful.   The "no shit" comments are certainly warranted. But this fact needs to be reiterated and supported by analytical measurements. It's the only way FIFA will finally get their heads out of their asses and make a change.

 I like your Reddit name.   Understandable.  But this is what seperates between good and bad ranks right? If you know how to play the map well, know how to have buybinds you would rank up in no time.  I'm sure in higher ranks anyone playing the map would set it up already. If you think you are at a disadvantage, you don't just SIT there! Just go out and do the buybinds! If you are too lazy - It's your responsibility.  Think about it, I'm not trying to sound rude but these are some examples in comparison;  Grenade buy binds are a must! Otherwise, people without them would be at a serious disadvantage as they would have to scroll through the nades to throw one.  Or,  Aiming at a head level is a must. People who do not aim at the head level would be at a serious disadvantage.   I expect feedback, so I respect your opinion!  In order for the terrorist to buy an AK he would have to leave the bombsite, or, buy before entering it. The buyzones would be far away from bombsites/spawns, so in order to buy a gun he would sacrifice time. If he wins 1v1, he wouldn't have time to run back to the gun.  The difference is, you would spend your money for that AK and you wouldn't keep it the next round (or wouldn't keep the AWP). Thus, if your economy is bad you wouldn't be able to buy certain things next round. Another thing is that you would risk dying in a 1v1, so you would loose both AK and AWP. Lastly, there are two buyzones, so the CT's can always do the same.  One of the good uses I could think of is that you could drop your teammate along the way.  But you have to remember, in normal matches, especially in 1v1 situation you would want to plant the bomb first and not risk going far away to buy another gun just to loose it later and have an economic damage. It only works one way, so I think that people would prioritize just keeping one gun and getting the job done.   Hello, I'm Guma! A map maker from Mapcore, and I need your help here!  I decided that my map will have dynamic buyzones.   Something that Counter Strike never had before. However, in order for that to happen, I need to explain what dynamic buyzones are and what it means for gameplay. Lastly, to hear your thoughts.   So what are the dynamic buyzones? It is a new gameplay element. In normal maps, there are usually two buyzones - One at T spawn and one at CT spawn. They are limited to certain amount of seconds. However, with dynamic buyzones, there would be two additional buyzones somewhere at the map. For example, at middle areas or areas that are very exposed (so you don't just keep buying stuff and spamming, someone can still kill you). So why are they dynamic and what do they do? First of all, unlike normal spawn buyzones, the dynamic buyzones would never run out of time. You could buy anytime during the match. However, it changes the economy.   An example T's are doing an eco rush strat, their entry fragger gets 2/3 picks. However, he does not need to wait for the next round. He can take his time and run to the nearest dynamic buyzone and buy himself a gun. However, again, he would take time and stay exposed. Additionally, the buyzones would not be near the bombsites, so the rotating CT's can catch the person buying off guard. Same for CT's, they can buy an Awp during rotation. If CT's remember the buyzone locations, it would be very easy to take down anyone buying guns there.   As for grenades, you can only buy one of each grenade every round.   So how would the buyzones look like? Well obviously, it would be some sort of a crate with a laptop on it. The area to buy would be exposed and not very big.  Remember, the money would not change and you would not get the guns for free.   I feel like you've nailed most of things you need to know for Hammer, however, you need to work on themes. Hope to see other maps made by you!   Same for every rank, honestly.   Title 14, Section 1211 of the Code of Federal Regulations, implemented on July 16, 1969, states that it is "illegal for any US citizen to have any contact with extraterrestrials on their vehicles"  My question is, if government does not CONFIRM the presence of aliens on Earth, then why is there such a law? I'm quite interested, just thought I'd let you guys know.   Never alt-tabbed. I minimized CS:GO, alt-tab usually causes lag for me. Also, how am I supposed to know of a glitch like that? Shouldn't Valve take care of something like this? I don't think the ban was justifiable.   Before I say anything, it might be a glitch that got me banned, so I'm hoping for the best and trying to hold back my complaints.  Okay, so I have absolutely no proof that this just happened but it happened. I have no idea how. I just didn't have enough time to screen cap it.  So I decided to queue for a match. I have been kicked a few times before (Russians kicked me for saving an AK in 1v5 situation), however, I never received a cooldown. So I turned on my game and pressed to queue for one. There was no yellow cooldown message at the time. Normally, If cooldown would have been issued before-hand it would have not let me queue. However, the queue was up and going.  I decided to minimize my window until I hear the accept button.  (You can hear the "ready" sound when you minimize the window) It was taking quite long, which got me suspicious, so I checked and apparently.. I've got a cooldown. Out of nowhere. And no, I don't care if it's 7 days or 30 minutes THIS shouldn't have happened. I have no clue.  I never pressed any buttons, I never pressed BIG GREEN ACCEPT BUTTON or joined a game. Did absolutely nothing and yet I got a cooldown. Ridiculous.   As to anyone wondering if it's just me, having memory problems, no, I absolutely did not press an accept button.   I love how the first terrorists line of sight was like a laser and you jumped past it :D   I love how people are so picky about the title. It's just an uncommon scam that needs to be known, that's all.      Yup, the SSG skin with an Eagle I think.   "RoadToSilver" nice    How much are people going to repost this?   I don't know what happened, but apparently my comment got removed. There is a higher spot than that were you can climb on a bridge.   I wanna know your crosshair   no its not   *krutdurk has changed his name to M-Dawg*   It's what made the skin for me IMO.   Damn son, where'd you find this?   It's okay, Valve will add some unique Music Kits to compensate for you.      Silver Elite Master is the barrier between Nova ranks, this is where the most struggle happens. Lots of smurfs and angry players trying to get that Nova rank. You'd call me stupid, but the skill of some players in SEM is that of a Nova 4 (without including the smurfs).    what   What they ment by saying "temporarily", was because the only way to get custom HUD's was through external websites, which could also carry along viruses/cheats that could get you in trouble ETC (although I haven't seen that happen). My idea is that Valve is looking for a way to introduce custom HUD's through Workshop, as that would make the most sense.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR0WN55p_zI   Did you read it until the end? P.s - You are a perfect representative for a troll, telling someone to kill themselves shows that you have internal problems with your family/friends, hope the problems get sorted out and you get better.      Hopefully it's a fix for the memory leak. For those who don't know, ever since the last two updates the game would constantly get more stuttering after a while.   This is the worst I've seen yet. Wow.   It was there since Overpass was released. I don't understand why people are upvoting this.   On most newer games not, for example on Battlefield your bullets take time to travel and have an angle, so if you are shooting from far away you have to aim slightly above or position yourself so that your bullets can properly hit. That's why you can also get those moments when you and your enemy kill each-other at the same time. It is a slower method, but it doesn't work for games like CS:GO or COD.   Projectile shitting? No. They are hitscanning shit on Terrorists.  EDIT - In CSGO bullets do not travel like projectiles, they instantly get registered where to hit.       I will, I tried to do some cover for T's, again, depends on how people like it.   Because I'm using the new Train assets (models, textures). I'm not a very good texture artist! :P   Guys, you are downvoting him but he's got a point. It's something that has been suggested cause it takes quite a bit of round time just getting from the spawn. Spawns will be shortened, but not significantly.    Explain please? How should I reposition them?   One day, we will be looking at this video laughing, remembering the good ole days of CS:GO, just like we look at the "door stuck" video and still crack a smile. This is going to be big, mark my words.   Cause in real life big buildings (especially nuclear facilities) aren't built from plaster or metal foil? Haha. As you can see garage is still wallbangable.  It's going to be replica of current De_Nuke with better graphics.   Thank you, my remake relies a bit more on geometry and texture changes, rather than cluttering it with props, so you should have stable FPS when I release the map.   I'm making it for fun. Just like surf maps, people don't make them for profit. I'm sure there will be some casual servers with this map. I'll also host my own too.   Every map has different ways of approaching, so when you say make banana wider you mean remove the useless collumns that make firefights frustrating. As for the planks, sometimes you wan't to see clearly without revealing your position. It's also unnecessary clutter that we are talking about here.   It looks like T-Rekt sticker   It won't, depends on how people like it. The doors will be able to be opened by grenades (If a grenade touches the door, kind of like 1.6)   Before any comments go, I'll explain a little bit. The map is going to be identical to the current one besides graphical changes with new Train assets (which look good, by the way). The only changes that will be seen are that the A heaven will be significantly reduced in walkable space (CT's will no longer be able to stand above Mini, or so called garage, giving an opportunity for T's to take A from outside garage pretty easily). There will also be door from outside to squeeky. All the other general things will be visibility, smokes and improved gameplay for Terrorist side, while still keeping balance in mind.      The planks and the banana obstacle are pretty useful IMO.   The same water texture is already on De_Nuke.   I wanted a map where if a cheater presses a common toggle key it would let other players in the server know he pressed that key. There would be a prevention from spamming the message, and It wouldn't exactly show that someone is cheating, but it might look suspicious if he presses it at certain moments. It's just out of curiosity   Well I'm looking for how to do it, not to know that you can do it. Besides, I've already looked into website, it provides basic info but not the one I need in this case   Hey, I have a small question. Is it possible to make it so that if someone playing my map would press a certain key it would write in chat globally that "player1 pressed INSERT key"?  It's a rather stupid question, but I'm going to make a map where if you press the cheat keys it would let players in the server know. Yes, I do realize that some people have binds, but it would be very obvious if someone is cheating or not based on rate of pressing it.  Anyways, just a question! I hope this is possible to do in Hammer, since I'm a map maker and I don't know how to host a server.   1. The demo was really low quality. Not sure if it's your fault. 2. How is that LEGEND? 3. I realize it's Silver, but cmon 4. The illuminati joke wasn't even funny, it was out of place. 5. Don't do MLG/Montage parody jokes unless you are going to edit the vid properly and upload it to /r/montageparodies. My personal experience. 6. Triple, but nothing special, srry.   You cannot use kill command in competitive.   Don't get me wrong, working on custom maps is always fun! However, it seems like more and more people are moving onto official gamemodes, as they can be beneficial if your map gets into an operation. A lot of people focus on making detailed environments for CS_ and DE_ maps, and for the Surf maps a lot of map makers are experienced on the gameplay itself and not the CS:GO engine capacity. However, if someone has quite a bunch of free time and is willing to spend it for non-popularity/monetary cause he can make very detailed surf/other maps.  It's my point of perspective as a map maker, I tend to work on DE_, CS_ maps more as the competitive gamemode is one of the biggest. Surf maps are bigger and harder to make, so there are less of developers for those. It's also hard to make the ramps and check the distances.      I never said it's impossible to bypass these things. Either way I am willing to bet those who can bypass have a little bit more brain power and communication than the ones who constantly shout "cyka blyat" when you loose an eco.         He whines about someone cheating and gets banned by VAC himself. VAC bans doesn't mean it's just CS:GO, VAC bans can be issued on any other game.   It's like a depository of matchmaking crap, a place full of smurfs, ragequitters and genuinely new players who get insantly kicked. It's almost as if you are new to the game you will get insta-kicked because you do not meet "Silver" standards.   Get a fucking microphone  Q: "Hey guys let's rush B!"  A: "Shut up cyka blyat!!!!"  get a fucking working microphone  Q: "Hello, you guys wanna go B? (Proper quality microphone)  A: *Everyone goes A, xXDavidXx goes alone middle and gets wounded to death. BOT Yogi is already approaching middle as well with a bomb in his hands.*  Did I mention getting a microphone?  Q: Yes?  A: Yes.  Don't argue with your teammates, they are human just like you  Q: "David, why did you go B? We told you to go A with us! Cmon man, teamwork is the key!"  A: "STFU!!! ZATKNISYJ!"  If you are the lurker, don't take the bomb.  *Bomb is at spawn, duuh.*  Drop the bomb behind if you are rushing in alone.  *Drops the bomb, dies* "WTF WHERES THE BOMB, OMG?!!!!"  Shut up if someone's trying to clutch  Say something - SHUT UP!!!  Don't say anything - WTF, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME WHERE HE IS? WHY NO INFO????      Wow, is it that time of the week? The repost day?   There's at least more than 700 users with that username.      Well it depends, I can hit a lot of jumps on Vertigo as well, except that I don't gain any speed.   Sometimes if you press crouch button after the 3 hops, if you time it enough it will reset the bhop limit so you don't need to stop. That's what happened in the video, I believe.  Can't confirm though.    It's done on Valve's MM, I'm quite surprised I hit those jumps. Thank you! :)  And yeah, I used to bhop on Source a lot after I saw Phoon's videos, It was almost like a kid trying to impersonate Superman :D  	70
 Interesting.

My daughter was home schooled by her mother (when we were still married) starting in 5th grade.. They both wanted it so I went along with it. The first year went well. 6th grade was a disaster.

There were no opportunities for socialization, and the program didn't even meet the UC system requirements.

Scary stuff!  9 therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim, 10unto the children of the east, [to go] against the children of Ammon; and I will give them for a possession, that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations. 11and I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. 12Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them; 13 therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I will stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; even unto Dedan shall they fall by the sword. 14And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord Jehovah. 15Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with despite of soul to destroy with perpetual enmity; 16therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. 17And I will execute great vengeance upon them with wrathful rebukes; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.   WAIT, Wait, wait. . . . Let's look at some other translations. That can't be right:  New International Version: There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses.  New Living Translation: She lusted after lovers with genitals as large as a donkey's and emissions like those of a horse.  English Standard Version: and lusted after her lovers there, whose members were like those of donkeys, and whose issue was like that of horses.  New American Standard Bible:  "She lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys and whose issue is like the issue of horses.  King James Bible: For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.  Holman Christian Standard Bible: and lusted after their lovers, whose sexual members were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of stallions.   International Standard Version: She lusted after her paramours, whose genitals are like those of donkeys, and whose emissions are like those of horses.   NET Bible: She lusted after their genitals--as large as those of donkeys, and their seminal emission was as strong as that of stallions.  GOD'S WORD Translation: She lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose semen was like that of horses.  Jubilee Bible 2000: For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses and whose issue is like the issue of horses.  King James 2000 Bible: For she doted upon her paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.  OK - pretty much all the same. My bad.

In 2009, the NYPD responded to 4.4 million radio-received assignments. Of those, 206,000 calls involved weapons of some kind. Despite those massive numbers, there were only 47 cases in which an officer intentionally fired a gun in a conflict.   "Wildlife experts believe it has since left the city, headed down the Peninsula, but not before taking a stroll through town first."  I have no clue why they think this, or how it would make its way that far through the city, but I hope they are correct.   I used to live on the "Peninsula" and have seen mountain lions twice in the hills.  They are majestic, and a bit frightening at the same time.   No worries, I really don't care about some downvotes here or there. I post for the "conversation".    kkk is a terrorist organization  Dude, I'm not in favor of the KKK, but please give a source for a recent court ruling on this (not just some "resolution" against the KKK).

Ezekiel 25:17. "**The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon you.**" Now... I been sayin' that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, that meant your ass. You'd be dead right now. I never gave much thought to what it meant. I just thought it was a cold-blooded thing to say to a motherfucker before I popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. See, now I'm thinking: maybe it means you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. 9mm here... he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or it could mean you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. And I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak.

Neuroscientists believe REM sleep serves different roles in newborns and infants: It allows their brains to build pathways, become integrated and, later, helps them develop language. (Similarly, juvenile birds learn songs during REM sleep.) While all that grunt work is going on, they lack the head space and the ability to imagine themselves as the heroes of baby adventures, or to dream up fantasy toys.  Dreaming, neuroscientists think, is a cognitive process that arises in early childhood, once babies have acquired the capacity to imagine things visually and spatially. Babies do have experiences, before and after they are born.

 You're right, some of the responses are just... not... anything?  They're not funny or clever, it's just a sentence. Yet they get points.  I guess that's improv for you.  Either way I still watch the show and enjoy the shit outta it. My favourite part is when you get surprised by some of the guests. Did you guys see that recent episode with Eli Roth? That dude was hilarious and stole the show, who would've thought?   Guess it depends on your country, I'm an Australian who is 177 cm (5'9" and a half) and I'm of average height.   Kinda small? I mean isn't the national average 5'9"?      It's certainly both, but I wouldn't equate them as 50/50.  I'm very much looking forward to putting some lean mass on in a little bit for the reasons you've stated above :)   I found that losing weight made me exercise rather than the other way around. Initially I  just planned to control my diet and start exercising down the line.  But something curious happened.  A week into my efforts (after I saw the scale go down), I started sleeping better. I started having more energy. I got home from work, sat down and thought "shit, its sunny as hell outside I'm gonna go for a walk"  That has **never** happened before. That's how it started. 4 months later and I'm doing 20-30 minute jogs and loving it.   I exercise. And I am dead.  F   I think the thread was posted on /r/BestOf?     F   Plot twist: /u/Starbucks_Lovers is Dexter's dark passenger.   Woah.    "go ski into a cunt"  That is one of the greatest insults I've ever heard. So much rich imagery.    I remember that thread, that was hilarious. The mass swooning was real   "NotTheAFP"  AFP is the Australia version of the FBI   Plus more sanitary than public drinking fountains   About 4 seconds.  Deako  **Deako is taken**  train_subject5967  **train_subject5967 has been created**   Seriously. That's it.  I was at my place with a few friends. We were watching the game (she was watching from her own place), the second her team got knocked out, I decided to post on her Facebook wall "Hey X, our power just went out, did your team make it through the finals?"  I immediately got removed from Facebook and she didn't return any of my calls or texts. I really did try to contact her for a while and she wouldn't respond. Screw it, she wants to be this immature I don't really want to remain friends anyway.  Reflecting back on it, I don't think I would've appologised even if she asked. In no way was what I said mean or offensive. We had a relationship where we would make fun of each other all the time. I honestly thought she was stronger than that. Oh well.  And adding to that, he she have said "Listen, you stepped over the line. Don't make jokes about my sports team anymore" I would've stopped. But she didnt, she just clammed up and threw the baby out with the bath water.  edit: words   A car. Seriously.  I have the means to buy a relatively expensive car and I have several friends who actually did this.  I'd rather spend 11 grand on a 3-4 year old car and take decent care of it. I could squeeze a good decade out of a car like that.   As long as it runs and is has relatively low maintenance then I'm all set. I have zero want or need for an expensive new car.   Flossing.  Not going to lie, I always hated doing it. But for the past few months I decided to start forcing myself to floss right before bed and I find that it's actually really pleasant to go to bed with such clean teeth.  Also my teeth have never been whiter or stronger, so there's that.   OHHHHHH I GET IT NOW  MOSQUITOES == BUZZFEED     Fucking get this. A good friend of mine threw 10 years of friendship down the drain because I made fun of her favourite football team not making it into the finals a few years ago.  So stupid   The context of the joke is that it's a German guy saying that line.   It's like that scene in Beerfest where a cuckoo clock goes off and a German guy says "Zee fuck is zat?"   Just adding onto that, he also did a Celebrity Who Wants to be a Millionaire... He then failed on one of the first questions. The question was *What's 11 X 12?"  Yeah, that happened.   Thanks Kile.   But I just know that if I buy new XL clothes that I'll be in L clothes within the next month or so lol   Speaking of that, if you see Kyle can you let him know his coffee is ready?   Thanks, I will keep going for sure.  The worst part was trying to buy work slacks. I just could not find a place which sold decent work slacks which had a high enough waist.  Not a problem anymore of course :)   Aside from cardio 2-4 times a week, the majority of my effort is in the kitchen. Even then there is little secret.  I eat a good mix of food, but much less than before. I'm on a 1800-2000 calorie diet. I only drink water or the occasional coffee.  It really has been that simple, so simple in fact that I'm kicking myself I didn't start months ago.  If I were to give your question a simple 1 sentence answer, it would be this:  **I stopped eating and drinking like an unsupervised 15 year old**   Plus if they're just a little bit too small, it would make a pretty good tangible goal to work towards.  Every day the pants fit a little better.   I have to do jeans shopping too! My 42" jeans require my belt to go 4 notches in :D  I actually have no idea what pants size I am anymore, same deal with my work slacks.   Nailed it    These numbers are so unfathomably high, at what stage do you stop negotiating a higher salary? Surely he can't spend all of that money, right?   I started trying to lose weight a little over 4 months ago. About 3 months ago my 8-ball pool team was getting new club shirts made and they needed everyones sizes. We were told that it would take a few months to get them made and delivered. So I ummm'd and ahhh'd not knowing what my size would be in 2-3 months time. At my fattest I was wearing 3XL clothing, so I ordered 2XL because I had no idea how much I would lose.  Well, I had a pleasant surprise today. My shirt came in and what do you know. I'm not a 2XL anymore. Not even close.  I ended up trading it in for an XL shirt and it fits like a glove (maybe even a little loose :D). I'm an XL for now :)  I think it may be time to go shopping.  Edit: Oh wow, this blew up more than I thought it would. Good to see my NSV helped many of you :)  For context **27/M/5'9" SW: 285 CW: 241 GW: 198** [I also posted a progress picture the other day which got buried](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/3c6blf/27m59_sw_285_cw_241_gw_198_4_months_in_44_pounds/)    Titantic deserved oscars for the visuals, but 1997 was an amazing year and Titanic didn't deserve all of the accolades.

That was the first thing I did when I moved into my current place, I installed a lock :D  Since I share the house with 3 other guys, it's stopped a few awkward moments.   So myself and 4 others were playing last weekend and we enacted the Rando Cardrissian rule (essentially for each question we draw an additional face down card for each question and if that card wins, then the 'Rando' fake player gets the point). Normally when we play this rule, we get some funny combinations and Rando gets a few questions.  Not this fucking time.  Holy crap, Rando was on fire. He was pulling out crazy hilarious card combinations. Even winning a few multi card questions.  In the end I (21 wins) only **just** beat Rando (20 wins) and that came down to the last question remaining.  It was insane, has anyone else had this sort of luck with the house rules?  If you've not already, you should try this house rule. It's rather hilarious.   I'm confused, isn't there a review embargo?   Am I in the water? Because i'll take the piranha sized toddlers. I wouldn't even need to fight back.  Am I on the land? Because i'll take the toddler sized piranha. I wouldn't even need to fight back.   You clearly have never procrasturbated before.

Nonsense man, if we're willing to allow people to file their taxes completely online, then we should be willing to allow people to vote online.   I dont understand men who're so uncomfortable around women doctors. THEY'RE DOCTORS. IT'S THEIR JOB.  Years ago I had to have an groin inspection from a doctor, there just so happened to be a female on staff. She was nothing but professional and at no time did I feel uncomfortable.  You mention penis questions as a reason for wanting a male doctor. She knows equally as much about the male anatomy as the male doctors. If you want a male perspective, talk to your friends. If you want medical advice, talk to a doctor.   No need for luck, i have science on my side!   The last time I did a platonic tickle fight with a girl, we ended up hooking up.  So... nah : /   Without any further information about you, I can tell you that 5 lbs a week won't continue forever. Eventually, you'll start losing at around 1-2 lbs per week, which is a healthy drop rate.   Adding onto this, being able to do up your shoes without holding your breath :D   Be prepared for the weight loss to taper off, don't get discouraged! I can tell you that the first week I was so worried that I hadn't calculated my diet correctly.  I was so excited to stand on the scale after 7 days and see a smaller number. That validation was amazing :)   Well done, that's a huge effort.  My personal realisation? That the concept of 'healthy foods' is wrong.  You're better off seeing food as energy. Most people imagine a healthy diet as a diet which is nothing but foods which are labeled as healthy.   Could you imagine eating a diet of nothing but fruits and vegetables? I would losing my fucking mind.  A 'healthy' diet should be a balanced one. So eat a mix of foods within your daily calorie budget. So have an ice cream on occasion, have an apple. Why not have chips AND salad with your steak?  Once you start labeling foods as either healthy or unhealthy you end up setting your diet up for failure. I had a big pile of bacon and eggs for lunch yesterday and I'm still losing weight. Because I ate under my deficit.     You know what? I like Gohan the way he is. Hear me out, pls no downvotes!  To me, he is a trope buster. You know that 'chosen one, must rise to the occasion' trope? Well he turns it on his head, to me Gohan is the audience. Most of us were his age in the early DBZ and we were all wishing we were the son of the great Goku. As the series goes on, he is told over and over about his great potential as a warrior and as a man. But with that comes the realisation of "just because I can, doesn't mean I should".  The Cell saga was my favourite saga of the entire series and this was mainly because of Gohan. I enjoyed the way that his character decided that he didn't really want that life anymore after Cell. He wanted to live his life since his childhood was sorta stolen away from him due to the previous sagas.  In the end, he will always answer the call to fight and defend his world but he won't devote his life to maintaining his power.   So yeah, they could've made Gohan a mirror of his father but I think they gave him real depth by making him more well rounded as a character. He also answers the question we've all asked ourselves "Would I want to be the son of the great Goku? Could I handle the responsibility? How would my life be affected?"   Iain Glenn's RL accent is amazing to listen to. He did the audiobooks for one of the ASOIAF prequels and it was so fucking good.  Roy Dotrice is the master, but Iain is an excellent substitute.   That's the problem with dialogue based films, if you're not into the characters/story/discussion, then the long ass conversations can seem superfluous.  I enjoyed the fuck outta that movie :D   You've never had it? It's amazing, 9 out of 10 Doctors agree.   Ironically I think you woosh'd his satire   I don't understand it, it is a system which could be completely digitised. The Australian Government already digitises so much of our lives, why not this?  It's compulsory for us, I can only imagine how many people in the US don't vote only because "It was too much of a hassle".  Fine, you want your freedom from compulsory voting. At least reduce the hassle so that you increase voter turn out.   I'm going to chime in, because technically I'm allowed.  I was born in the U.S back in 87' but I've been living in Australia the majority of my life.   I actually kinda wish I was over there with you guys, getting into the celebration. While I see myself as an Aussie through and through, I do kinda still feel some sort of connection to the states.  Luckily for me I have dual citizenship, so if I wanted to, I could live with you doods :)   thank mr skeletal 4 the calcium   I'm pregnant and it's yours.   On an episode of the Gruen Transfer, someone came up with a hilarious idea for marketing.   Create a blank business called "9 out of 10 Doctors" and tack their label onto your product.  "9 out of 10 Doctors would recommend Asbestos Chewing Gum" is no longer false advertising.   This thread has been a good read gals, but I'm going to keep losing this weight no matter how you tempt me! :D   Also, see Argo.  Affleck made both of those movies incredible, the fucker is 2 for 2.  I think /u/tastypinksock 's anger is a little unwarranted, unless he's only seen pre-2010 Affleck.   I think Reynolds is a good actor that has a bad agent.  I was going to make a post, but you summed up all I was really going to say. The above line is my main point.  I have a bit of a man crush on Ryan Reynolds and he truely seems like a hilarious person outside of acting. But he hasn't chosen his movies well **at all**.  The only dramatic role I appreciated him in was Smokin Aces and that's not really saying much.  The dude really needed to get a role with this season of True Detective of something. Go back and do some more hefty dramatic roles.    Holy shit what a week.   I'm so sad at the timing of LA Confidential's release, but who knows - had it have been a massive hit, we might have a whole bunch of stupid sequels. This way we can enjoy the movie as it is :D   What's the rate of homosexuality among pedophiles?  Is it the same as the general population?     Australia - Animal Kingdom, Chopper, Romper Stomper, The Castle and Rogue.  There are many more, but these are the first few which come to mind.  As you can see, our gritty crime dramas are top notch.   Amazing fucking movie, everyone should check it out.  While you're at it, watch Chopper. Both are Australian crime classics.   **L.A Confidential** - it is one of my favourite movies growing up and it held up after all of these years. There is little about this movie which was bad, I couldn't look away.   After watching Terminator Genesys try to gut a franchise that I love, I found solace in a classic film which will likely never have the sting of a shitty sequel.   Yep, been a thing for a long time :D  Something lots of us work towards    Is what a thing now?      Hey guys,  I've been holding off on progress pics for a while now because I don't really see that much of a change in them (my clothes are all practically falling off, it's just the side by side which doesn't seem that much different).  Either way, 4 months in and I'm finally over the half way point for onderland. Still very much going strong. Thanks for all of your help my friends. My next progress post will be in onederland I hope :D  For the sake of clarity, I've been on a 1800-2000 guestimation calorie diet (not counting calories religiously, I just have a general idea of how much is in my food and I budget around it), I'm losing around about 2 lbs per week and as I'm edging closer I'm adjusting my diet ever so slightly.   I do cardio at the gym 2-4 times a week. It was previously 45 minutes of fast walking with intermittent jogging bouts. But now I've worked my way up to 30 minute session which is 5 minute warm up walk, 20 minute solid jog and 5 minute cooldown. Which is actually one of my goals! **Hooray for NSVs**.   I know there are a lot of people at /r/loseit who are really close to my stats. **Keep at it**, trust me. You'll wish you'd started earlier. I know I do :)  Thanks for being awesome guys. [Here's the progress!](http://i.imgur.com/V6h1Krf.jpg)       Norton has assured me that all traces of that virus has been removed.   Niceeeeeeee  Keep it up man, i'll be there in a few months :D   Sorry, I don't have google installed :(  I'm sorry for any pain and anguish that I caused you. Not sure if that's a thing.   the plus-sized section... (which may I add, isn't called such, because it would be offensive to call it like it is) It's another story.  Oh come on, that's literally what it is.  Plus size is already a fucking watered down euphemism.   Nope :)  *Mate* is also an excellent way to save yourself in those situations where you forget someones name.  "Oh, hey... *Mate*...."   Awww, I clicked this link hoping you had discovered some ground breaking zero calorie dip.   I'll just keep eating celery dipped in water.   Diabetes induced blindness? Not sure if that's a thing    I'm rocking the reverse hitler PLUS the patchy beard.  Are you me? The reverse hitler is literally hitler.  At least my cheek hair is starting to fill out : /   I may or may not have changed my weigh in day from early Monday morning to late Sunday morning because of this....     I've been off the butts for almost 2 years now. You can do it! Mind over matter.   I'm a man of routine, so I did some intial research into the calories of my favourite meals. Once I had those figures, I built my daily budget around it. It's been 4 months and I'm down 43 lbs via this guestimation method.  My diet is around 1800-2000 cal per day.   I totally keep missing weekly check ins lol  Oh well, my loss is still consistent :)   It's a fine line between preachy and informative. I personally don't bring anything up unless they ask. If they're interested in trying, then i'll help them out. If they say any /r/fatlogic, I'll politely discuss it with them. But this all depends on the friend.  At the end of the day, I've not said a single damn syllable about my weight loss on social media. So only the people who've physically seen me of late know. This is mainly to avoid being preachy (I see some douchy stuff on Facebook about weight loss).  My plan is to make a single post with progress pictures once I reach my first goal, then I'm not going to bring it back up again.   If if this thread is "Just For Kicks", then why are we posting pants size? :P   M/5'9"/242lbs/**see below**  I'm not sure lol. I really am not. I need to go clothes shopping but at the progress I'm going at, I know i'll just end up needing to buy new clothes in a month or so.  For context I bought an XL hoodie and that fits rather nicely and my 42 inch work pants (which I used to wear without a belt) now need my belt adjusted to the 3rd belt hole. Also, my 3XL shirts are far too big now. I could probably wear an XL comfortably :)   That's why Australia is good, *mate* is both gender neutral and formal enough for most settings that your average person encounters :)  *Excuse me mate*, *sorry mate*, *g'day mate* or *thanks mate* are the most commonly stated phrases down under.   Make sure you time your weekly laundry well. I do mine Sunday night so that my entire weeks worth of clothes are GTG before work on Monday.    the leaked casting calls pretty much confirmed that Euron  I know it sounds like it could be Euron, I take issue with the statement that it *pretty much confirms* that Euron will appear.     whenever I see a more than moderately attractive woman, my reflex is to assume she's either a total bitch ~~or~~ **and** taken  FTFY     The leaked casting call asked for a pirate, that doesn't confirm anything. Had you said "there is hope", I may have agreed with you.  I'm being realistic, there is no need for the Greyjoys to get intertwined with Danys story, she has her own fleet in Meereen.   This is what annoys me, I absolutely **love** Spartacus and Jai was one of the best characters in it. I want him to succeed so much... But he keeps picking shit projects and ends up giving shit performances.  He needs a reboot (his career I mean, not a movie), or perhaps a dramatic role in a TV series. I mean the dude is still young... Kinda.   Speaking as an Australia, I was totally shocked too. His accent completely hides any trace of Australian accent.  He's one of my favourite actors going around right now. Awesome in Zero Dark Thirty and Rise of the Planet of the Apes   Guys... I really don't want to spoil your fun but.....  I think the Greyjoy plot is done with for the show : /  Perhaps there will be some follow up, but Balon Watch will continue forever.... Like a lover waiting at the pier for her husband long lost at sea.   Dude discovered the secrets of relativtitty   Oh god his Cinnabon bit is exceptional   I appreciate your hyperbole, never change.   Maybe not ridiculous, but it sure was stupid.  Years ago I had prided myself on always taking care of my phone. I've never lost one or damaged one. This was mainly because I would always be careful handling them and I would always slap my pocket where it normally lives before I leave the house or do what ever.  So anyway, one day I was at the GFs place and in my board shorts. Before I dived in, I did the old thigh slap to check that my phone wasnt in either of my front pockets. Not in there, good job train_subject5967.  So I dive in and have a swim. After swimming around for a while and I lean up against the wall of the pool and feel something poking my lower leg.  **Its my fucking phone**. I now realise that these board shorts don't have side pockets but they have pockets at the bottom of each leg. So that's where I logically stored my phone when I changed.   **TL;DR Phone storage hubris cause the destruction my pursuit of life long phone preservation**    I wonder how many people like me thought your name was pronounced **Warli-Zard**. I'm an idiot.   Arr lmao   I first saw breaking bad episode to episode from the get go and i found her annoying.  I recently went back and rewatched the whole series back to back and my opinion has changed, i totally sympathised with her.  It must be because watching episodss week to week over many years causes you to forget the context of her actions.   It's brutal, because I notice them and my brain tells me "Don't stare man, she's here to work on herself and doesn't want to be gawked at". So a glance will do.  That being said, it works well for motivation. I see girls at the gym and think "Keep doing what you're doing any you could end up with one of these hotties"   my current boyfriend messaged me with only "i choose you"  Bold move.  I like it   I've only had 1 break up which I could best describe as *amicable* and that was my most recent one.  It was very mature, almost like I was dating an adult.  I sat down with her and had a long talk, she understood and empathised, I understood and empathised with her. In the end, she accepted it and a bunch of our conversation was about how to deal with some of the other stuff logistically speaking. Getting our stuff from each others houses, how to tell everyone etc.  I came away from it thinking that she too was looking for a way out.  What I **can** tell you guys is that if you really don't want to be in a relationship. Leave it. I felt 1000x better after finally leaving and I've spoken to her since, she feels the same way.   I lived in the 90s from age 3 till 13 which is when I defined myself as a 'kid'.   But how do you know that the man that you're approaching doesn't also have near debilitating anxiety?   The obsession that people have in their 20s with alcohol is stupid and rather unhealthy. While I'm not going to be completely sober for the rest of my life, I certainly don't drink to get *fucked up* anymore   After being dumped by a girl I ended up trying to fill that hole with some random hook up. We ended up moving in together immediately and I didnt even really like her all that much. Turns out she was also coming out of a break up and we were both doing the exact same thing to each other.   We ended up breaking up and she moved out in the middle of the night owing us rent money.  0/10 would not do again   Agreed. Doesn't the threat of true mortality add more beauty to our lives?  Wow that came out more pretentious than I would've liked.  Cunty McFuck-Fuck.  That's better.   Six Feed Under. What a series finale.  It was so fucking perfect, a hour long *where are they now* for all the remaining cast.   I'm down 43 lbs from 285 lbs and I've found little difference in interactions. I know that I interact differently to people though. Now that I started losing weight, I'm sleeping better which means I have more energy which means I'm more out going which means that I'm more willing to be chatty with people.  So in that regard my interactions have changed.    Blue waffle.   Yeah you're correct there I think. I love Orion but it doesn't hold a candle to Suicide and Redemption. I can't wait for their 10th album, I hope they do another epic instrumental!!   To be honest, you're doing the best way. Cheat meals are better for sustainability than cheat days I find.  Having that friday night dinner where you have a massive steak meal with a couple of beers will make you feel so much better than a full day of drinking and bad food.     I never ever understood people who can't talk to customers.   7 years in retail has taught me that if you're nice to even the most horrible customers, you end up having a better time with them.  I ended up developing what I call a *customer assistance voice*. Which is essentially if you take your nicest demeanor, multiple it by 2, increase your voice by an octave, smile **a lot** and be overly sympathetic. It's so easy to do that I often wonder if I'm a sociopath.  So when I see people in the service industry who grimace and are rude to customers I find it completely unacceptable. **We get it, you hate your fucking job. But you're in a fucking customer facing job so do it correctly for christs sake.**  	120
 my favorite billboard ever.   want   That they would even try to prosecute is fucked up. The criminal justice system need reigned in.   Truth   I dig the wallpaper   thats fucking teamwork    this   so underrated.       I was initially put off by the lack of apps so starting looking for a way to run android apps (it's a windows PC why wouldnt there be a way to do that?). I found bluestack and it's worth a shot. It's basically an android emulator. It will allow you to run android apps and that opens up the whole universe of mobile/tablet based applications    this is all i was really hoping for. thank you.   2nd this.  The common notion that atheism is the neutral position is incorrect.   I have not read the book but the basic criticism of the new atheists outlined in the synopsis is dead fucking on.   The Varieties of Religious Experience by William James. Arguably one of the most important books of the 20th century. More than 100 years old but great religious scholarship and good read.  I second the recommendation for The World's Religions by Huston Smith. Also, while some scholars turn their noses up at the mono-myth -and its not necessarily religion per se- I still think Joseph Campbell is fantastic, check out The Hero with a Thousand faces.  Sacred texts you cant go wrong with; The Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads,  Tao Te Ching, Chuang Tsu , Dine Bahane (Navajo creation story), The Tibetan book of the Dead, The Lotus Sutra, the Heart Sutra   Obviously there are more but these are the one I think of most quickly to give you some range within the different traditions.     worst beer in the world. just awful.   yeah, this is the way to go.  i also have an HDMI running to a matrix switch so i can toggle the TV as a monitor whenever. I like my Xbox but it doesn't really add anything this way.   I was changing the blade on a hockey stick once and reached out and caught a glob of hot glue as it was falling to the floor... Sticky. Painful. Stupid.   I coach youth football and every week the coaches watch our game from the previous week to figure out what we need to work on. 4 dudes pointing at a TV and expecting kids to get what is being explained to them seems like a bridge to far so i'm looking for a way  to highlight what we want them to see.  Most of this is just going to be highlighting individual players on a given play. It doesn't have to be fancy, it could be coloring the player a bright color or drawing a box around them. Then maybe some lines and arrows to indicate gaps and responsibility. the idea is to then email a few examples(maybe as gifs) to the kids parents so they can go over with them during the week.   My experience with AE is mainly making gifs. This is probably rudimentary stuff but any kind of direction would be appreciated.    don't underestimate the value that a full version of windows gives you vs a mobile OS either.  So much flexibility.   I picked up the i7 as a laptop replacement for my wife to use for school.  But at this point i like it so much i'm probably going to pick up an i3 to replace my iPad.   with 128gb micro sd cards in the $100 dollar range now, storage space can be less of a factor. That and all the cloud based storage options available (office 365 gives you 1 TB per user with a membership) is why i went with the 256gb model of the i7 instead of the 500. the bump in storage for the money just didn't seem worth it.    I think he's dead on.  Im not a religious person and am generally sympathetic to the kinds of arguments made by atheists. But as someone who has formally studied religion and philosophy, one of the things that has always struck me about Sam Harris specifically and new atheists more broadly is that they just dont know very much about religion. More than that, what they do know demonstrates striking level of conceptual superficiality.       Most of my life i probably considered myself SBNR. I never associated the idea with new agey spirituality at all, though. To me it was a way to reconcile the sense that there was something more to existence than the visible world while rejecting the institutional structure of religion which I saw as problematic very early on.  These days i just consider myself agnostic. Maybe a panenthiest if you really wanna try and pin it down.     Im convinced that the only way to demonstrate the absurdity of the current false dichotomy of pro-choice vs. pro-life is to argue from the pro-abortion position.  I love this guy.     Madmartigan is so good. http://i.imgur.com/KHHxQBV.gif   I was changing the blade on a hockey stick once and reached out and caught a glob of hot glue as it was falling to the floor... Sticky. Painful. Stupid.    false. This demands immediate action at the highest level! The people must be heard!   I disagree.  I mean, it's certainly ridiculous, but that's the point.   Whose time do you think is being wasted exactly? It's an automated system... yeah they screen it for total bullshit but even then, the intern in the Whitehouse press office that has to read this stuff? This thing probably made his day.  Lighten up.   just happened to me at work regarding Obama and "the Ebola outbreak."      a buddy and I used to make bets on who could avoid laughing at that first Tom Green bit. "that's that address... wise ass."   just posted it.     	31
 Track 2 in particular.   Glad you liked it. Their album, Milo Goes to College, is probably one of the best they ever put out, and the whole thing is on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-8oujFcuQ0   But the US does care about corruption.   I've crushed on her since the 90s, not baffled by it, just can't help myself. I hope you've seen The Daytrippers, that is one of my most favorite Posey movies.      And then keeps an eye on the suspect until he has passed the table with the silverware.   Their reaction time was very impressive, she went for her Taser since her partner was right there with the suspect, her partner managed to get the suspect moved away so that the suspect was no longer between him and his partner.      A quick look on Google suggests that there really isn't a good site with data covering all of Texas, most of the suits would be brought against the municipalities (or counties) and the relevant law enforcement departments, not against the state specifically (unless it involved DPS or Texas Parks   Wildlife).            Contemporary R B combines elements of rhythm and blues, soul, funk, pop, hip-hop, and dance. I went with the record store labeling version of of "R B" as a catch-all for popular music.         Possibly "suicide by cop," sounds like he was struggling with a lot of issues: http://www.palestineherald.com/news/bushey-family-trying-to-comprehend-loss/article_f0bee44a-0968-11e5-a9cc-93de734fa71c.html         http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/07/02/park-police-washington-navy-yard-shooter/29607533/                           [Here's an article about the shooting.](http://www.palestineherald.com/news/bushey-shooting-videos-released/article_34b8e3ec-1f82-11e5-9e3c-0bcf0658377a.html)         Very impressed by how quickly he managed to get a guy with a gun in hand moved into a position where his partner was no longer in the line of fire.   Seems like an appropriate Subreddit to me. RIP Sir Nicholas.         [Try Value Thrift Mart, it looks like it has super cheap clothing.](https://plus.google.com/108146087525968619843/about?gl=us hl=en) OR garage sales.   Except our plethora of sports talk radio, and the NPR stations.   A I understand it, 1560 is now just a delivery device for Yahoo Sports Radio. Nothing is really left from its glory days as 1560 The Game (not even the name), except John Granato, and I bet he's still there because he's an investor.   When I want music from that period, Lithium on SiriusXM has a better playlist.      I wonder what "mixologists" get paid.            That's a very low key looking vehicle, would probably take me a couple extra seconds to realize that was a police vehicle if I saw it while driving in North Carolina.   One of the most conservative people I knew in law school (in Texas) was from New York City. The world is shades of gray.   Nobody in Houston ever bothered my Kinky sticker.   ?   No, not in Dallas, it has way more liberal now than it has probably ever been. Just a general rule of thumb to understanding politics in Texas: big cities lean liberal (Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin) while suburban and rural areas tend to lean conservative, with some exceptions in heavily Hispanic South Texas.  What part of New Jersey are you moving from?   Plus, there have been a lot of heavy, slow moving rain clouds that dump a lot of water in one area in a short period of time.   Everytime I've gone to a soccer match at NRG there was tailgating. I'd say give yourself a large cushion, especially if you plan on tailgating. Not sure the exact start time tonight, but I know 610 is a parking lot on a good day, combine rush hour and soccer fans on 610 it's a nightmare. I remember somebody once saying they saw a vehicle pulled on the shoulder of 610 selling Mexican jerseys to people stuck in 610 traffic.      These days I'm not sure what their wage is, I think it's state by state. I bet most bartenders don't get minimum. As for the other positions, if you're the only waiter who doesn't tip them out, they'll remember.   Not to mention that waitstaff often have to tip out busboys, bar backs, bartenders, dishwashers, etc. (Varies by restaurant.)   Sammers SC is holding a watch party at [Nick's Place](http://www.nicksplacehouston.com) on Sunday July 5th at 5:30 p.m. The United States will be playing either Japan or England.   I would recommend 790 am.                                     I haven't had any problems.   The owner of your apartment complex is responsible for providing parking, not the city.         These days it seems like there are more mattress stores in Houston than Starbucks stores.                              Cruz only cares about playing to the most extreme right of the right-wing portion of the GOP. He doesn't care about what the majority wants, he doesn't care about what anyone who didn't vote for him wants, and he doesn't care about anyone who disagrees with him.  SOURCE: I live in Texas, and Cruz doesn't care about my political views or ideas.   I like him, and now I'm really glad I caught a live show in 2013.   I knew a lawyer who did family law and criminal defense, the back of his business cards essentially said that if you get arrested STFU and call me.      An option, though it's one that doesn't seem to get used much in Texas.   That's an option.                        I recently read Steve Osborne's memoir, "The Job," and he made a couple references to using these cabs when he was with the Anti Crime Unit.    Any idea what Rez this unit patrols?   The only time I've seen a sticker on a police vehicle indicating it was a seizure is when I saw a Harris County Constable in an old beat-up Ford F-150, felt sorry for the constable having to drive such a clunker.   Not surprised that Kenedy County isn't issuing them, the county's population is less than 500 people and I think they're all part of the Kenedy family or work for the Kenedy family.   I love how there are quotes around the word Truth, very appropriate in this context.   She can't be "fired," she can be impeached, but this crazy legislature won't do that, so the good people of Hood County need to vote her out of office at the next opportunity to do so.   [Trailer for Decline of Western Civilization.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhDrjKqtRK4) -- [Trailer for Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6tt5HOZ27U) -- [Trailer for Decline of Western Civilization Part III.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aI0WjBdNJw)                                        It is possible that your car matched a description in a BOLO and they were running your plates to determine whether they should pull you over or not.      I will say this, there is a two-faced element to Lakewood Church. The main services have that feel good, be rewarded, yada yada yada tone, but I've gotten the impression that the bible studies and other small group things at Lakewood do have a more evangelical tone to them. I knew a guy who started going there, became an usher, started going to bible study for men classes and turned into one of those guys who, like Orthodox Jews and extremist Muslims, got mad at women for not dressing modestly, it was their fault for tempting him.   I've heard this complaint several times from evangelical types.   Good to hear he's back home!   Years ago I saw a police K9 stop and take a piss in Dulles Airport, thankfully the police officer took the time to clean up the mess and put up a slippery surface warning sign.   What an inconsiderate asshole.                        Not from Season 2, but love how this scene captures the Rawls/McNulty relationship - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26TRIz2d1m8   In my neighborhood, there probably will be guns fired into the air (just not as many as get fired into the air on New Year's Eve).         Based on the news report I just heard on Channel 2, all of the counties in the Houston area are issuing marriage licenses to same sex couples, with the exception of San Jacinto where the Clerk says they're waiting on new forms (which sounds like they're just dragging their feet as a long as possible since all the other counties are making the forms work).      Keeps our skin smooth and young.                  The AG's office did try to stop a divorce case involving a same sex couple, but earlier this month the Texas Supreme Court ruled against the AG http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/texas-supreme-court-upholds-divorce-sex-couple-31891023         I call it a quirk, because I spent a few years living and practicing law in Wisconsin where there are limitations/requirements concerning what specific county can issue your marriage license. For example, if I'm a resident of Wisconsin and I want to get a marriage license from Milwaukee County, I or my fianc had to live in Milwaukee County for at least 30 days. People who don't live in Wisconsin but want to get married there, say in Bayfield (which is very lovely during summer) have to get their marriage license from Bayfield County.         Each state has its own laws regarding marriage (heavily tied to property law), but, states cannot enact and enforce laws that violate the Constitution. The marriage issue isn't new territory for the Supreme Court, in 1967 the Court issued a decision in Loving v. Virginia stating that state laws prohibiting interracial marriage were unconstitutional. I haven't read the full majority Opinion, so don't know if this was an issue in the outcome, but one major problem I have had with state laws that ban same sex marriage is that they also said the state did not have to recognize such a marriage that took place in a state where same sex marriage was legal. To me this goes completely against full faith and credit, which I view as a building block of our legal system.   Does anyone know what's going on in Fort Bend, Montgomery, and Brazoria Counties?  (Just as an interesting aside, there is a quirk in Texas law that allows you to get a marriage license from a county that you don't live in nor do you plan to marry in. I have friends who live in Harris but got their licenses in Fort Bend because it is a "prettier" looking license.)   That asshole Andrew Jackson didn't listen.    Paxton is basing his position on "religious objections" of the public employees, which has no merit whatsoever. Under his reasoning, the Clerk's office can say "We won't issue a marriage license to anyone who is not getting married in a Christian Church."   Houston is very pro gay, but the County is less so since there are some very conservative areas that are not part of Houston, and the office in charge of issuing the licenses is the Harris County Clerk.      This profile captures what's been becoming a major problem, people getting addicted to properly prescribed pain killers and moving on to heroin.         It was kind of fun watching Pornstache have to clean vomit off the display.   I'm definitely enjoying the humor and jokes in The Brink, glad to have something to fill the Silicon Valley void.   I thought so, but didn't see it under her IMDB page.   Living here in Texas, hope I do say it to the "wrong" person sometime.                                    The extreme right wing of the GOP love his BS.   Such an embarrassment to Texas.      No, because you probably would never vote for him, he doesn't care about Texas or all Texans, he only cares about the people who actually cast a vote for him.      That's not how the Constitution   rule of law work, that's not how any of this works Paxton.   The Cherry Sisters were a Vaudeville act, consisting of real life sisters, who performed music, poetry, readings, fake hypnosis, and other artistic expressions. Audiences found the group devoid of talent and would yell at group and throw fruit and vegetables at the Cherry Sisters during their performances, and yet the group continued to tour and perform. Were they precursors to comedians like Andy Kaufman or were they really talentless?                        I figured since /r/mls allows posts about the women, /r/Dynamo would too.   Barney Miller anyone?                        I doubt he'll say anything during the service, the few times I went to Lakewood with my now ex-wife Joel never seemed to get into controversial topics, sticked to his normal be positive themes. Though this post reminded me of a discussion I had with a gay friend who was looking for a Houston church to attend, he didn't like Lakewood because there wasn't enough "fire and brimstone" in its message.                I agree with you, those still fighting same sex marriage are on the wrong side of history. But it is good that their efforts to fight against what is right are futile because there are counties in Texas issuing licenses to same sex couples, and you can get a license from a county even if you don't live in the county and you don't plan to get married in that county.

What this quarantine is doing is protecting the political lives of Governors Christie and Cuomo.   This would be right if this quarantine *was* "protecting people from a seriously lethal threat". It isn't. Ebola isn't transmissable until an infected person is gravely ill. We knew that before, and we know that now. The *only* two cases transmitted in the US were nurses who treated patient zero Duncan near death spewing infected fluid everywhere, while wearing ineffective PPE.  It was the pathetic initial response by the CDC in providing the Dallas hospital with adequate protection that was a "seriously lethal threat" to these nurses. Thankfully they have recovered. What's happening now is a fearful over-reaction.

 Moosh is my favorite. SUPER CUTE   Best.   Beautiful!   Gorgeous. 10/10.    I stopped using hay racks because my rabbits will all just sit in them and pee all over the hay. I just put fresh hay in one side of their litter box multiple times a day now. They spread it around but generally only poop/pee on the opposite side and so they have a fresh supply to eat.

She's usually such a sweet little fluff and the sudden change has caught us a little off guard.    We have a Green Cheek Conure named Leela Beela and s/he (we usually go with she but haven't sexed her) is no older than 3. We took her to the vet for a first checkup last September after rescuing her from the animal shelter and she said that the bird was under 2 years old. Her bloodwork checked out and she was given a clean bill of health.  She is currently molting as far as I can tell because she has lost more feathers than usual and has a ton of pin feathers. I am positive she isn't plucking - there are not bald patches and the lost feathers don't look chewed or bent.   I know birds can be cranky when molting - so this might just be the first real molt she has had with us - but I was wondering what more experienced bird owners think.  Our bird usually: Active, curious, very friendly and interactive, wants to be with you always, vocal, does a few tricks, is very in love with my bf but kind to me - lets me pet her and interacts with me - just prefers to interact with him if she knows he is around. Seeks him out, doesn't really seek me out. When friends are over and bf is near she is usually kind of feisty, doing a swervy neck dance and hissing. She also does this dance when the bf gets home from work and greets her but then it is excitement not aggressive.  Our Bird Now: Still active and vocal... but does that aggressive dance much more. hisses and bites. even bites the bf once she is worked up. very hard to get her to do even basic things like step up. instead of pushing her head into my finger for more scritches she fluffs up all her feathers and bites me.   Any  input greatly appreciated.  Thanks.      Awesome!

Sure man, why not? Then proceeded to chain smoke spliffs the entire night until you couldn't see from one end of the room to the other.    When you potted it did you remove the original lead or just bury it?   This is great! While I love all the DIYs - many of them have seemingly infinite space to work with. Seeing such a great solution done with such a small area is really nice.   Thanks!     Would there be any flies if it is whitefly? Because there is nothing flying around and when I shake it a bunch of the white stuff just falls.    It looks like it could be a parasite - this pot was indoors in my kitchen windowsill. There is a little on the Thyme that was next to it but nowhere near as much.   Also not sure if it is related to the white things or not - but the bottom half of the plant is all dead: http://imgur.com/tueuphU      I love Moosh. Post moar pics plz   Just like the mutant. She's got both her eyes though...      The little pot was laying around the yard full of something dead and I just dumped it and used it for my plant. It has a cracked piece on the bottom and is not going to be great for the longterm - but was better than the half-missing pot that one was in before.   I'll get some pics of the bigger one when our sunflowers are done for the year and I cut them down.   There's another jade that's bigger than that one back there... it's buried in the sunflowers right now but I'll post a pic someday.  It has a bigger pot. I will leave that one in the yard. The only thing she really mentioned that her mother tended was the roses and those were in shit shape already when I moved in.    It's a pretty loose soil with some big bark chunks - drains great. I actually don't know much about care - but I do know they need great drainage and to soak them then let them dry out before watering again.   Letting them dry out has never been a problem. They get some water from the sprinkler I have going on the veggies but otherwise they've been pretty neglected.  Not as neglected as they had been before!  I'm hoping to learn a thing or two in here since these do so well in CA.    Repotted: Http://www.imgur.com/a/BkpF1    Yes - repotted the big jade from before using your recommendation on pot type/size.  Haven't talked to the landlord - would like to never speak to her again if I can. Figured it deserved a new $7 pot regardless.  The other plant I found in the gutter during trash cleanup week years ago. It had a broken pot too and got repotted yesterday.    It was in a broken pot in the yard of the place I am renting - I had nothing to do with how it looks or how old it is! Hoping I can help it out from here forward.   They're both pretty big... no clue how old either of them are   I know nothing.  Found the one with red tips in the gutter during trash cleanup and the other was in a broken pot in my backyard in the place I'm renting.  I just water them occasionally and leave them outdoors in their broken pots... finally repotted today   Http://www.imgur.com/a/BkpF1     	32
 Gotcha. Yeah I had a class with 15 kids on IEPs and they put a learning specialist in the room with me. I definitely could have used more direction with teaching a skills based class.   I would obviously talk to your administration and if they do nothing, then I would get the union involved.  By the way, a degree in education means that you have training for students in special education. If you don't want kids with special needs in your class I would look for another job, maybe at a charter or private school.   So, long story short...I am a teacher in a low-income/high teacher turnaround district. This past year I have had some unbelievably horrible encounters with my principal and administration(to the point where I have actually reported to HR). After all of this, I am obviously keeping my eyes open for new teaching jobs, but I have some preoccupations about going to a different school because I truly love my kids and I adore the members on my team. I was hoping all of you could give me some advice?  1. Are all principals bullies?  2. Do all principals/administrators they use their power to intimidate?  3. Do all principals compare veteran teachers to newer teachers?  4. What happens at your school when there is a huge behavior/safety concern ? (For example: a student throws a heavy backpack at another student's head) 5. How does your administrator discuss concerns?(i.e. email? text? face-to-face? hallway?classroom?)  **Thank you all for your help!!**  I need some reassurance that there are good principals out there!  	3

 Half of the world doesn't get it haha   Woooow great joke bro. I am LITERALLY rolling on the ground laughing   if you like, theres more at http://www.train_subject6359.com. thanks for looking :)      They are the clowns of the dog world! Mine never stops derping   Around $40. Each frame cost probably $4    This makes so much more sense than my way   Haha it's just a joke. 400 degrees for 10 minutes with a pan of boiling water on the lower rack is what the internet said to do   Where the light touches the emulsion, it hardens to the screen. The part that a covered does not so you can then wash that part out and it becomes a stencil pretty much   Bangalore. Represent   This is so cool! Ah that skull. I'm an artist and I would love to have used that for something.   It was [based off a painting I did](http://i.imgur.com/s627PN7.jpg). I didn't know about the wendigo at the time but people kept asking me if that's what it was so I looked it up and god damn that is some cool folklore.   I was considering using 14k halides from my aquarium. Good thing it happened to be sunny that day :p   That depends on how fond of drinking beer and passing out in the sun with your dog you are. In other words, yes.   I'm sure it will work the same assuming you use ink that is meant for metal.

If I can sell a few paintings this summer I will definitely make it happen   If I were to cook a shirt in the oven, I'd put it in a pan in a 400 degree oven with another pan of boiling water below it for 10 minutes but I would never do that, nor would I encourage others to do it.   I'm not sure of the mesh size but thanks for the info! I want to give multicolor a try later this summer I'll have to try and save up for aluminum. This one was just a simple design though so I felt like I could pull off doing it on the cheap   Should have clarified that. But I want to give multicolor a try later this summer   I cleaned it. That's strange I will have to see what happens with mine. Only used it once so far   Your jealousy is understandable   You can buy premade screens! You'll never know til you try   I used the oven. 2 washes in and the design is still looking like new. Just make sure you keep an eye on it if you do   I meant for a simple design like this. I'm sure it takes a while to learn multiple colors and finer details. Thanks for the tips!   I need them to be long so that they'll fit around the necks of my foot strangling victims   Wait what? I ate like half the jar   $12 for emulsion  $10 for ink  $4 for wood and screen  $7 for squeegee  $7 for transparency  So about 40 bucks I'd say   I like to bend it backwards when my thumb is pinned and insist that it's still up. Technically correct is the best kind of correct.   To be determined haha. Hopefully forever!   Yep I flooded this one. I'm looking into all that for the future. I just applied the emulsion with the squeegee but I don't like how it dripped   The sun hardens the emulsion so that it is not soluble in water   [is this normal](http://i.imgur.com/Ldejocs.jpg)   That and it also guides the screw in nice straight   Water based. The best way to make sure you don't destroy the emulsion is to let the water pressure do all the work. You can see mine has some rough edges but that's actually how the positive was. It came out almost identical   I considered doing that but this way is just so cool and science-riffic   I used the speedball fabric ink. I am 2 washes in and very happy with the results.

 Betyder TTIP at jeg kan handle varer fra USA p internettet uden at skulle betale moms og skat?   Nej, dette er ikke en "danske piger er racistiske" rant, det er blot en observation. Jeg vil lige starte med at sige at, jo, jeg ved udemrket godt at der findes danske piger som dater mnd af anden etnisk herkomst, og s vil jeg desuden ogs gerne sige at jeg synes det er helt i orden hvis man har prferencer nr det kommer til dating. Hvis ens prference er at date indenfor sin egen race s synes jeg det er fint nok. Jeg synes frst det begynder at blive "racistisk" nr man helt undgr folk af anden race/etnicitet (ja, jeg ved godt jeg kludrer lidt i terminologierne her, men I ved hvad jeg mener :) ).  Jeg har som s mange andre folk i Danmark brugt tinder til dating, men har desvrre mttet konstatere at matches er meget f og langt fra hinanden. Faktisk kan der g dage uden at jeg fr en eneste match, og det p trods af at jeg synes selv mine billeder er rimelig klare.  Jeg er meget sparsom med at bruge faktorer som "race" og "etnicitet" nr det kommer til kommunikation mellem mennesker men det er nu alligevel svrt ikke hurtigt at tnke "hvad nu hvis det er rsagen?" nr man prver at finde ud af hvorfor man aldrig fr matches, hvorimod ens etnisk danske venner endte med krester i folkeskolen og gymnasiet og selvflgelig ogs har en del matches nu i dag p tinder.  For en uge siden blev det efterhnden rimmeligt kedeligt og deprimerende at vre p tinder igen uden nogen matches, men s s jeg at hvis man opgraderede s har man mulighed for at ndre sin lokation til hvorsomhelst i verden. Opgraderingen glder kun i en mned og virker en smule dyr, p den anden siden koster det ikke mere end en biograftur eller en tur ud i byen p en fredag aften s hvorfor ik?  Havde det derefter meget sjovt med at ndre min lokation til forskellige steder i verden. Jeg havde jo nu uendelige "likes" og jeg kunne lade som om at jeg var i Los Angeles, New York, Maine, Houston, osv. Det har jeg nu brugt den sidste uges tid p og lad mig sige jer, jeg har fet en masse matches lige pludseligt! Snakkede med en masse sde amerikanske piger og det s jo ud som om de faktisk var tiltrukket af mig! Hvem havde troet det???  Fik nogle nye bekendtskaber, nogle nye Facebook venner, en del flirten osv. Det var som om en helt ny verden havde bnet sig op for mig. Da jeg nu havde uendelige "likes" s prvede jeg ogs i perioder at g igennem de lokale danske piger for nu at se om situationen havde forbedret sig, men det havde den desvrre ikke.  Jeg er lidt bange for at konkludere noget her, men jeg har lidt p fornemmelsen af at pigerne i USA er lidt mere tilbjelige for at g p dates med mnd som ikke har samme race/etnicitet som dem selv. Jeg tnker at det mske er fordi at derover er deres samfund meget mere multikulturelt hvorimod at min folkeskole og gymnasie i Nordsjlland var 95% etnisk dansk. Derfor giver det vel ogs god mening at man hlder til sin egen etnicitet. Jeg skal ikke blande mig i hvilke prferencer folk har da det er deres liv og de m bestemme selv, men jeg havde bare sdan lyst til at dele denne lille anekdote da jeg omsidder har indset at der faktisk findes damer derude som finder mig attraktiv og for frste gang fler jeg en lille smule selvtillid :D   Fuck that, I want to see ProtonJon go back to his roots.

It could be 5 plus minutes, but it wasn't. The video shows he barely held them up for 5 seconds. Plus the first time, he put his hand in his pocket. Can you give me a good reason for why he put his hand in his pocket? For all the police knew, he could be reaching for a gun in his pocket.   What if one of the trolls had a ph.d in quantum physics? Then they'd be more informed than you.   Come on... You're telling me it's hard to keep your hands up for more than 10 seconds when the police are pointing guns at you? The first time, he literally took his hands down in his pockets.   Can somebody explain why the guy kept taking his hands down?   It is regulated by Swedish culture which is racist.   Typical racist. You claim white date white. Are you so afraid of losing your Swedish girls to foreigners?      Does anybody else blush during matches when they see Zero Suit Samus? Does it make it harder for you to play?      how is CNN different from Daily Mail?   Pamela Anderson    and if I'd objected in a room for of 60+ plus people who all thought it was great, I'd have ruined the entire thing.  So what if you ruined the entire thing? You can always compensate your parents with a new trip somewhere else unless they found nothing wrong with the incident, in which case I wouldn't have cared about ruining the entire thing.   What about engineers with a degree in engineering management? Do they work for themselves?   All these people saying the girl sent them a message or started the conversation. That has literally never happened to me in the 25 years I've been alive. Instead it has been me awkwardly trying to start a conversation and then get rejected. Some people are just lucky!  	22

You don't.  Get some more training.   "Rehosted content" is an article or opinion piece that is cut and pasted by a website from an author-authorized publishing source.  Ron Paul authorized antiwar.com and other websites to publish his original columns and therefore this was not "rehosted."  You may want to check with more experienced moderators that have been on reddit for more than two years before deleting articles and columns in the future.         So you will delete any post of a Eugene Robinson column that isn't directly linked to the Washington Post website?  Yeah, I didn't think so.  Ron Paul has been writing columns for antiwar.com since its inception.  Don't bring your own political leanings into moderating.  I'm sure you would have no problems with a "rehosted" column written by Elizabeth Warren.   The article is an original piece by a longtime columnist for antiwar.com.  If you disagree with the content, fine, then say so, but don't use a bogus excuse to delete the article from the front page of /politics where it had been for most of the day.

 You're an obvious troll.   Why should anyone be downvoted for asking this question?  I thought the whole point of conspiracy theories was to not take anything at face value but to use your own eyes and your own brain to come to an understanding of the true situation.  Why should we question counter-mainstream ideas any less than mainstream ideas?  How about some integrity here people.   I'm not in that loop anymore.  Very fortunate to free myself.

It might well be easier in Japan where conformity and obedience to authority are even more ground in to their society than in the West.

Explanation and source please.   or is it only.... the beginning?!   Annihilate the hatred in your heart.  Then when the majority of the people involved in this conflict do the same, then there will be peace.   You do realize that just because science hasn't discovered something yet doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  Did the effects of relativity not exist before Einstein?  Did Pluto not exist before we knew about it?  My statement is called a hypothesis.  Something that you base scientific studies around.  It's almost as if you don't understand science at all..   Also, I was just describing the methodology that 432 tuning arose out of.  I didn't make it up.  The doubling is because that is how an octave is defined!  The note A is always given as the base pitch for any standardized tuning. You clearly do not know much about music theory in general and I think you are speaking out of ignorance on a lot of topics.   Actually no, that's not what confirmation bias is.  Confirmation bias is when you only seek out information that confirms beliefs you already have.  I think the phrase you're looking for is "placebo effect".  I have a degree in psychology for the record.  And yes, I have done a blind test and found 432 hz to be more pleasing to me.  Here do it yourself: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVoVr9UwOQM   All I know is that I like how it sounds and how it makes me feel. I don't give 2 shits about convincing anyone.  I don't think I'll be posting on this subreddit anymore because I simply tried to share some thoughts and information and just got shot down for doing so.  So, peace have a nice life.   Elaborate.

This video is To me, this video speaks of how to scientific is merging with the spiritual.  We are learning the physiological and scientific reason on how this amazing concoction of herbs works her healing magic.  How do you know this man is "deluded"? What exactly about his comment gives you that impression?  I think his having done it so many times means he knows more about it than you or I (for the record, I've done it once.)   Sure.  It's called the [Schumann resonances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumann_resonances) which is basically an electromagnetic resonance caused by the interaction of the constant lightning around the Earth and the Earth's atmosphere.  It so happens that the fundamental frequency of this is 7.83 hz approximately 8.  Now, musically an octave is defined by a doubling a frequencies, so using this as the base we arrive at 512 hz for middle C (EDIT: sorry, one octave above middle C).  Basing the other notes around that frequency we get 432 hz for A.  I'm actually not sure why the numbers are rounded.  Maybe because of the appeal of using powers of 2?   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumann_resonances   I am a proponent of 432 tuning also known as [scientific pitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch).  I don't necessarily think 440 hz tuning is result of a conspiracy, more likely simply a mistake out of ignorance.  I believe that even if you can't distinguish the difference consciously, there are still unconscious effects of listening to frequencies that are actually in sync with the humming of the Earth.  It is subtle, but real.  This is a very new topic and I don't know of any scientific studies examining it, but it's definitely something ripe for exploration.  I'd advice you to not simply write something off immediately because it sounds a little out there.   If we don't destroy ourselves first, this is pretty much inevitable.   My question: Why does Marx generally get all the credit for "communism"? What specifically was Engles contribution?   He use a bad word. I'm telling!   (It's not.)      I found [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GAYtu7ATC8).   This is really interesting but I would love to see more primary sources.  Examiner.com literally lets anyone write anything with no substantiation. Let's keep digging!   That's really a questionable claim if you read all the comments here.  There is a loud vocal (hopefully) minority around here that can't seem to make the distinction.   Diversity only prevents unity among bigots.   Real love is never self-destructive, only uplifting.   This is happening everywhere.  CA is just an example.   Maybe it's not viable to stop cold turkey, but we can definitely move away from it.  There are many things you can do starting today, biking, reducing energy consumption, switching to plant based diet, starting a garden.  Then you can look into renewable energy options like solar, or wind.  We don't need a new infrastructure for this.  I think decentralization of production is key.  Can we make an impact? I think so.   I want to be a trustful, but discerning individual.  To trust the right people.   Thanks for an informative post.   Solution: get off of fossil fuels any way you can.   Yes, good for you, but in this case you not having a facebook profile would not stop the government from creating one FOR you.   No it's not just the truism part.  How about the idea that people who don't like misattributing a quote are "shillz"?  Or even if you just disagree, you are therefore paid to do so?   Omg, are you new to the internet? Voltaire never said this for the 67,312th time.  Also, while we're at it, the definition of insanity is NOT doing the same thing over and over.  And people DON'T only use 10% of their brains.   [So did the USA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny)   As a scientifically-educated "new age hippie", I think this is a good idea.   No, not everyone does this. Just stop with this tired cliche.   Did you guys read the description of the video?  The deer was bottle-fed and raised by this family and socialized with the dog from a very early age.  They ARE friends for life.   From my anecdotal evidence, it's the opposite.      No it isn't, and you're wrong.   Are you implying that all state elections are rigged?  Because it was citizens who decided it was time to legalize.  I'm not saying government and media doesn't do everything it can to manipulate, but they don't actually have 100% control over what happens in state referendums.   People admonish Jews for conflating themselves with Israel "Anti-zionism does not equal anti-semitism" and then go and say things like this, conflating jews with Israel.   I was having a conversation with a friend recently and they mentioned that Buddhism teaches about "10 levels of consciousness".  Is this true?  Can someone point me to reading material about this?  Thank you!   Is the model extracted from the game directly?   I notice the usual "Jews are the devil" crowd is conspicuously absent on this comment page.   For some reason I was expecting a dress made out of duct tape. This is much nicer.   Yes, they should be very thankful that they were bred to to be forcibly impregnated, have their young ripped from them after a few days, round up and placed in a pen small enough that they can't even turn around, pumped full of hormones, be forced to pump as much milk as they can possible produce until they dry up, likely suffering infections, only to be shipped off to slaughtered in the end.  That really sounds like a great life. /s   Awesome! The cows thank you. Can you take the next step and give up dairy?  There are really great alternative cheeses I promise.      Well, not a whole lot to be honest, besides posting some links that I found inspiring.  Sometimes a piece of art isn't the thing itself that does the changing, but rather the thing that plants the seed of change.  It's called inspiration.  Really, it's better than nothing.  It's a start.   And what have you done to change the world today, hmm?   I'm not mad bro.   Yeah, ok. Thanks for being honest.   OK, I'll taze you repeatedly and see how long it takes you to start walking.   Why would they break their legs? Do you break your leg every time you jump?      Just watched a video about the new GUI system. I have never been so psyched to make GUIs before!   Thanks for replying on my behalf.  I was crafting a reply along these lines but then I decided I didn't really want to get into another debate with a rationalist today. =D   If your partner is worried about you having sex with others in a DREAM, they are way too insecure.  Dreams are supposed to be the place where we can act out whatever we need psychology.  It's a natural escape valve for desires and fears, even those we didn't know we had.  It's the only place you can do whatever you want without fear of judgement or consequences.  Lighten up and have fun.   A biological process causes our experience of EVERYTHING, not just dreams.  So you can't use that criteria to say dreams are any less real than waking life.   The videos do look fake.  But then, are these people really dead?  If so, why not just really behead them?  If not, where are they?   Click on your name next to your karma.  It's one of the tabs at the top (on the same line as "overview" and "comments". Cheers.   I know, I know... but what about my likes and my 400 "friends"?   People have been getting high since before they were people.  Animals such as deer eat herb on the regular.  Likely, early in our evolutionary like our ancestors ingested marijuana.   /r/eldertrees is what you're looking for.   Why bother to defend your policies with law when you can just hire a shady mercenary group to execute your will with no accountability?  Why didn't government think of this sooner? On second thought, I'm sure they did.   You're crazy.   I want to find out more and possibly help.  Am programmer. PM me.   Can you link to this tape please?   Try the save button.         How does PixelPusher compare to Arduino or BeagleBone?  My suggestion is to try using a Slerp function to smooth the motion and make it look more natural.   That video rocked.   Where does the C come from?   If you're interested, the EPA was investigating this [until they mysteriously dropped the case in 2012](http://www.binghamtonhomepage.com/story-green-right-now/d/story/anti-fracking-groups-ask-the-epa-why-it-dropped-wa/37848/v_37C2ypVUS3KENCd0VzDQ).   People here don't like the suggestion that you should actually change your diet/behaviour in light of information.     And if requesting me to do things is what you want to do, by all means, have at it! But rather, how about instead of impotently requesting others to do things for you, how about you try being the change you want to see in the world.  That's exactly why I did start proposing solutions.  Did you even finish reading my post?   But I guess there will always be defeatists and people who like to hide like you. Nothing new there.  You're calling me defeatist because I asked you to start thinking about solutions? That's funny.  	100
    1. Bernie 1941; Biden 1942; Clinton 1947. They're all old. So what? 2. Too soon to say, given his surge.  Don't nip it in the bud - let this movement blossom across the nation.   Yes, mine them for resources and develop them with condos and strip malls.  I saw that Wisconsin wanted to sell park names.  How about BP Wilderness Park?   It's really bad.  They want to hide, those sneaky bastards.   It was an example of how the media can use one tiny incident to shape/control the hive mind.   Right. How did it happen? Maybe there is a connection to Wisconsin's high rate of alcohol consumption and the continuing elections of Scott Walker.  Alcoholism = poor judgment    Hilarious.   Defining Russia Musically; p.470; Richard Taruskin; 1997; Princeton University Press. Refers to Musorgsky's "aristocratic companion and probable lover, Count Arseniy Golenishchev-Kutuzov."     Did this guy graduate from high school?   All good points that you've made.  Don't forget that he's short, ugly, cross-eyed, buck-toothed and chinless.  Americans don't elect short, ugly Presidents.  Oh, I forgot stupid and morally bankrupt.  The Kochs like him because he's empty and stupid - easy to control.   I favor harsh and severe consequences for drunk drivers.  Too many innocent people have been killed by drunk drivers.  Caught driving drunk?  Lose your license.  Caught again?  Prison.  I know this is an unpopular position. Too bad, drunk drivers.     	12
    "lawl"         I really want this to be the case :(         My girlfriend had a plate too. This is just half the steak (it was a 17oz cut)   I highly recommend trying it. It has changed meat for me completely. There are tons of diy ways but I just bought a sous vide machine made by anova culinary: http://anovaculinary.com/    Wow you're right it does look way better!   here's another dish I posted a while back... I think you may like the plating a little more  http://i.imgur.com/9XOx56o.jpg    haha i could have plated it better... it was late and I was starving and just wanted to eat!   Here you go:  Seasoned the steak with salt and pepper. Sous Vide with 1 tablespoon butter at 131F for 90 mins, then seared it for 1 minute per side on a really hot grill  Boiled red potatoes, mashed with 10 cloves roasted garlic, salt, pepper, butter, and milk until you reach your desired consistency. I even added the leftover juice from the sous vide bag :)  Zucchini and asparagus were seasoned with salt, pepper, paprika, cayenne, garlic powder, and olive oil. Throw them on a hot grill for about 5-10 minutes, flipping occasionally.  Broccoli rabe was blanched for 1 minute, then sauteed with roasted garlic, salt, pepper, and olive oil. It was my first time trying it, I didn't really like it (tasted kinda like horseradish)   Ribeye has always been my favorite. I actually enjoy the fattiness haha      Yeah I couldn't justify the extra $100 for an illuminated reticle. I'll probably never be shooting in low light situations    Glass is crystal clear, eye relief is about 4 inches I think. Awesome scope tho, highly recommended. It's just enormous, almost 16" with the sunshade on   The varmint models come with the 26" heavy barrel. I looked at the Magpul stock too, seems way economical specially since you can add the detachable magazine for not much more money. I just didn't want to wait :)   That's always great news, haha.  For now I'm just shooting Federal Gold Medal Match 168gr factory ammo. Once I become more comfortable I may start handloading, but I doubt it'd give me any advantage just yet since I'm still learning.   Remington 700 SPS Varmint chambered in 308.  I upgraded the stock to a Bell and Carlson Medalist Tactical/Varmint Style 2. Didn't really like the X-mark pro trigger so I swapped it out with a Timney 512.   Optic is a Vortex Viper HS-T 6-24x50 SFP with milrad reticle. The mount is a Nightforce one-piece direct mount, 20 MOA.  Lastly is the Harris bipod, 9-13 inch.   This is my first bolt-action and I'm looking forward to getting to know it and shooting a bunch to work on my accuracy. It will mainly only be used as a target gun.      Totally agree, I love that show!   Your poems never disappoint!    Amazing!   You guys are correct... these are udon noodles. Sorry for the mixup       Except the vast majority of these kids were Muslim... The motive for this attack wasn't over religious extremism but for retaliation    http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2014/11/11/mammoth-az-target-of-internet-hoax/18863451/  Good job, reddit...  	28
 You said daughter, so I'm going to ask, but the child that dies in Mad Max, named Sprog (or, at least that's what they call the child) is a boy, not a girl. So why all the girl visions? That was the only thing I didn't get, but I chalked it up to Max having a long line of adventures where we couldn't save people that we haven't seen. I mean, The Road Warrior, Thunderdome, and Fury Road could all fit into about a month's worth of time so obviously there's a lot of surviving going on that we don't see.   When I went to summer camp my counselor woke us up by playing [Too Short, "Life Is... Too Short"](https://youtu.be/_kMc6ELFM1U)   My daughter is in Florida for a week with my wife at Grandma's while I'm stuck back at home. I can't imagine. Thanks for your service, be safe out there.   The first thing I've seen from Destiny that I liked.    Was worried this might be about Sjaak and his R1, I thought he was somewhere up there recently.   It's going to be tough. This application is for Android, so it's written in Java, not something native to just dropping into or calling from LabVIEW. Although, sifting through the source code may give you some insight on how to connect to the device and query it for the proper info.   [(The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy brown dog.)](http://typedrummer.com/tcv3m3)   How much of a pain would this helmet be for someone that wears glasses? I'm due for a new lid and have been wanting something different.   Used roller on top of MDF. Sanded first, than tack cloth, than two coats of primer with sanding in-between starting at 100 and working up to 800, than two coats of paint, sanding between them. Yeah, it's smooth.   Or is there something I'm missing here? If an earthquake (like in Nepal) is caused by one plate slipping underneath another, that means the whole plate moved. What happened to all the other stuff sitting on top of that plate, especially at the other side of the plate where it meets another plate.  Edit: Thanks for the answers, this makes sense to me.   Video? Code? Write-Up? Circuit Diagram? Sounds cool, but just a picture?   Thanks, I was pretty close to justifying skipping it because I had done so much hiking. Decided not to make excuses and just go.   GT is GOATRper, so you know, raping goats?   Yeah, we started at Muir, not out at Mill Valley, so it was straight up, but early, so still pretty fogged over. We hiked all the way up to that view point that you can drive to, which is just over 3 miles from the Muir parking lot.   Had my cousin in town this weekend and a couple of friends from back in Kansas. They wanted to see the sights, so 5 mile hike in the Marin headlands on Saturday morning, another 6 that afternoon on the Dipsea. 12 on Mt. Diablo on Sunday, plus assorted running around etc... I threw my diet out of the window, kept within my calories, but most of them were imbibed in the form of fermented barley water. Needless to say, I was more than a little sore.  But this morning I still woke up at 5, dropped my cousin off at the airport and dragged my ass into the gym. Put up the weights I was supposed to be doing and lifted them. My body wasn't happy with me and complained the whole time, but I didn't care. I did it and I feel better because of it.

I spent the last 24 hours shooting my boss in the balls on Sniper Elite since I heard this was a thing in /r/gaming yesterday. I've now officially run out of things to do on my XBox.   I think the bike looks marvelous, and I did get a chance to ride a friends and it was awesome. I just can't look at the head-on without wondering what they were thinking. Put two BMW's side-by-side and it makes me giggle even more.   Weird, I didn't even notice this. I left work early and went home to shoot my boss in the balls on Sniper Elite, no problems at all for me.   Who is designing the headlights over at BMW?   At least you gassed through it this time. You've been practicing.    I subscribed just for the way you pronounce oregano. Pizza looks good too.   Okay, grill preheated, now how hot do I set my oven?   Is it normal for 3 year olds to wear diapers? (serious question) We're at 19 months and working on potty training now.   Let's not forget that horrible fucking show Caillou where Daddy is either just getting in from a run or just going out for one. Thank goodness his Mommy is there to fix all his problems.   Thank god. I was just saying to my wife last night when some stupid Dad commercial came on Sprout (that stupid fucking baby rocker that you control with your iPhone) that I was getting pretty sick of this shit. I work just as hard as she does and deal with the same issues, why am I reduced to being the bumbling sidekick?   Well now I have to go get my beard trimmed so I can find out what happened.   This sucks, I go to Al's all the time for either a straight razor or just a beard trim. This guy is the greatest, I hope that they're right and he can handle himself and just got a little lost.   Haven't found a bike that didn't like it yet. Done it on sport-bikes, sport tourings, my BMW GS's, my dirt bikes. Never killed a transmission, so, I'm guessing it's safe.   3edgy5me   Upshifting? Go full throttle, quickly roll off the throttle at shift point, no clutch, press firmly up on the gear selector, back to full throttle. One smooth motion.    Funny you mention it, we actually MP a bit, so maybe I can convince him to take the rest of the day off too and I can go home AND shoot him in the balls. Win win win.   Holy shit, I've never shot someone in the balls. I'm going to tell my boss right now that I'm leaving early to go home and shoot someone in the balls.   Yep, very surprising commute on the motorcycle in from Novato this morning. Left the house as the sun was rising on a beautiful promising to be sunny day, went downhill since crossing the Richmond bridge. Can't wait to get home.    My hope is that they build on the already proven parkour concept of Titanfall and add to it. Yes, I know, different companies and engines. There were just so many times in TF that I felt like this would be awesome if it was Mirror's Edge.   Dude, this is awesome. What's the hardware involved in this?   So, are you saying I should keep my job but sell my house and live on the street so we can all help this guy realize his dream of homeless programmers?   What about piezo feedback in the bindings or boots. Buzz the foot that you need to take weight off of. No more looking down.   That face weight loss though. Nice. Looking good, keep it up.   This weekend was pretty rough. My wife wanted to plant sunchokes, cauliflower, and some spinach which meant more underground planters (to thwart the gophers). So, three, 3' by 5' by 20 inches deep holes later I cut some wood for the planter sides, put down some chicken wire and filled the holes back in. Of course, this is in the sunniest part of the yard, and luckily the sun decided to break through the fog this weekend in the north bay, so that sucked.   Later that day, since I have some friends visiting we decided to go hit a new trail that I'd heard of but hadn't done yet in west Marin. It was a little tougher than I expected. Couple mile hike each way with some non-trivial climbing (not horrible, but not a walk in the park either) to get to the bottom part of the waterfall. Again, the usual cool and foggy coast decided to be sunny and beautiful on Saturday. Crank up the heat.  Sunday was full of walking around the city with same friends, and if you've ever walked around San Francisco you know our hills are no joke. Tally up a couple hours of that nonsense. So, yeah, by the end of the weekend my legs were pretty toast.   I still woke up this morning and dragged my ass into the gym. I did my Stronglifts and even threw another 5 pounds on my squats like I'm supposed to. That puts me 5 pounds away from 200 pound squats. Pretty impressive since I struggled with just the 45 pound bar 3 months ago. So yeah fat, suck it.   This weekend was pretty rough.

Fuck, what if every account on reddit is a bot except me.   I don't know why the downvotes, this is exactly right. I've spoken with numerous engineers that have used it, including our SolidWorks supplier at work who is working with MS to develop Hololens SolidWorks integration and all of them have said that this is going to change the way interaction with your computer takes place. These aren't sales people trying to convince me to use the product, these are other engineers doing the same stuff I'm doing, using development versions of the hololens.   So... Target fixation???  Ha, just kidding. Next time, just remember to gas it when you get into trouble. Works every time.   But I think that's the point. You can't stream a game AND watch Netflix at the same time. Whatever you're streaming is the same thing that's on the XBox. So if people are watching Netflix on it, you can't stream a game to your PC. If it does work that way, I'll shut my mouth.    Why would you stream to your computer if it was really just mirroring the XBox system? Not being a naysayer, I'm really questioning what this is good for? I understood how cool it was if you could do something on the XBox and something different on the stream, but this just seems like a way for people to stream to a laptop while the take a poop, but that's what Reddit is for.   Is that Vampire Bill?   18 months here. Glorious, peaceful sleep. Don't worry. It will pass, besides, every single time she smiles at me it's so worth it all.   Cheeky bastard.   Checked your post history for a second can't tell if boy or girl. Don't care, I'm going for it...  I've always got a couple of inches to give...  Hmm... awkward.

Required pulling over for a minute to regain my composure and catch my breath.   I know there's been some mention of using LabVIEW to interface with the Arduino platform. In line with that, here's another tool for using LabVIEW with an Arduino. This actually compiles LabVIEW code into Arduino code and deploys it. I haven't used it, but it seems like it's making a big buzz on the LabVIEW forums so I thought I'd mention it here.      Seriously. Why does it take as long as it does. Is it literally going out and downloading it's entire library every time it opens?   So is this the approximate power of the fully functional Death Star?   Also the speed of the rear wheel will help speed up or slow down the overall flip. There's a lot of 'control' in flipping a bike over.   That was a fun fact, but not really inline with your username.   Some days I need a break so I add 15 miles to my commute and shoot up Niles Canyon to 680. That's hit or miss. Thanks for the background though. I think the responses here have hit on the biggest points, and unfortunately it sounds like there's no "fixing" it.   Are you going in to get him every time her cries? Don't. Sleep training is tough. I've heard stories varying from "I did x, y, z and no problems", to I had to let her cry for 8 hours straight for an entire week. But, in the end, it works. Get your baby on a schedule. Dinner, bath, bottle, pajamas, story, one last diaper and than bed. Than, kiss them, tell them you love them, close the door, and let them figure out how to sleep. It's tough. It will suck. You will want to give up (your wife will really want to give up). You will be much happier once it's done.    There's a billion of these. I had three different ones installed on my phone. Turns out none of it mattered, these silly babies make their own schedules and pretty do whatever the hell they want to.   I live in Marin and work in Fremont. My commute home, regardless of whether I leave work at 11:00AM or 7:00PM or anytime in between is horrible. Why is this highway so ridiculously bad? It seems like even if there's not an accident there's a back up at least once along the way where we just sit there for 15 minutes going 5 mph.   I ride the motorcycle most of the time, so it's not as bad for me. But the days I drive really, really suck.   What is DDP yoga? Like, Diamond Dallas Page, DDP?   Sorry to hear it man. That sucks. All I can say is keep your head up and remember that no matter how shitty it seems to you, your son will never remember even an ounce of it. So if it gets too much, keep in mind that it's okay to put him in a safe place (like the crib) and let him cry while you and your wife take a time out. Also, I can tell you from experience that eventually you'll be so tired that you just sleep through the screaming.   LabVIEW Home is kind of a test subject for NI. If all goes well LabVIEW will be a free IDE in late 2016, the toolkits and add-ons will still cost money, but the development environment and executable compiler will be free. Not open source, but as close as you'll ever get with NI.   Check out Nick Ienetsch's article [The Pace 2.0](http://www.cycleworld.com/2013/09/16/become-a-better-street-rider-with-the-pace-motorcycle-safety-and-riding-skills/). If you like it, you can get deeper into most of the topics addressed in it in his book, [Sport Riding Techniques](http://www.amazon.com/Sport-Riding-Techniques-Develop-Confidence/dp/1893618072).   What about a quick perusal of Nick Ienetsch's article, [The Pace 2.0](http://www.cycleworld.com/2013/09/16/become-a-better-street-rider-with-the-pace-motorcycle-safety-and-riding-skills/)?    The north end of Muir beach. Not exclusively men, but exclusively people that don't shave, if that's your thing.   Gives me a headache to look at?   It feels good doesn't it. Now you can stop worrying about getting your knee down and go faster.   Edit: This was meant light-hearted, not saying that you're not trying to go fast, or just that you're out there trying to get your knee down. The first time I got my knee down it was like a weight had been lifted and I could stop thinking about when it was gonna happen. The next session after I got my knee down I dropped two seconds off my lap.   I've seen elephant seals mate out at Point Reyes. It is the most violent act of congress I've ever seen in my entire life. This girl would not survive. Hell, sometimes the pups don't survive if they get caught between a male and his mate.   You lost me. What do you mean counter flowing?   There's talk of them in the hills on the west side of Novato, been warnings about being careful early and late. We have chickens and some of our friends with chickens that live a little west of us (we're at Hill and Diablo) have lost some to Mountain Lions, so they're apparently pretty active in Marin at the moment. Obviously not directly relevant to Pleasanton, just saying.   I thought it was made legal last week? Just be careful guys. You all go out there and crash it up and they're going to take your nice things away. When I can get from the Bay to Seattle without worrying about traffic, I'll be happy.   Married? Not anymore.   Yeah, I pared it down to about 300, mostly shooters and fighting games. I may ditch the category list and just have the main list with the alpha characters pop-out, a recently played list, and a favorites list. I like the idea of a single list on the side though.   Or to go see Avengers, whatever.   Can I have my two minutes back. Holy fuck this may have been the worst recorded video in the history of mankind.   Is that the house from Fight Club?   I need to wash my bike.   Thanks, I'm writing in LabVIEW of all things. The back-end stuff (like launching the games, reading their info, etc...) is all C to interact with the command line, but the front end UI is 100% LabVIEW.   I thought about the control panel stuff, but it already looks a little crowded for my taste. I'm thinking of making the cabinet graphic, as well as the marquee and sample screen sizes smaller. If that looks better, than maybe adding a control panel graphic below it. I originally had the listing be a grid of flyers, but that was way too crazy looking for my taste. I'm all about simple I guess.   Agreed, as I mentioned in another reply, I cut a lot of corners to get something working with my hardware set, my folder structure, etc... I really hadn't thought about other people liking it enough to want to use it. I guess if there's enough people that like the finished product, I could generalize some of it and put some settings in there (like font style, size, etc...) to make it more consumable by the MAME society.   I might consider generalizing some stuff to make it run on someone else's computer, if people like it enough. For now I cut a lot of corners on the setup knowing I had control of where everything was in folders and what games I was putting on it, what monitor I was using, etc... I honestly did it because I felt like the effort I put in to writing my own front end was probably similar to the effort required to get Hyperspin or MaLa up and going. I didn't really think anyone would like it enough to want to use it.   I'm starting to flesh out the front end that I decided to write from scratch. Take look and give me your opinions. I wanted to go for a Windows 8.1 or 10 app look. It's going to run as a shell on top of a Windows 7 machine and will eventually incorporate some entertainment stuff as well (music, etc...)       I absolutely love splitting behind CHP officers. Those guys are the best.    Almost is the key word. I was working on a project once where we let some of the magic smoke out of a resistor and got it to be the exact value that we were looking for.   By mistake of course, I'm in no way claiming that the resistor was good after we did this or that I could've repeated the experiement with the same results. It just happened this way.   I'm half-tempted to buy it, just to see what's included and whether or not it can open my gargantuan AF project.   The Hyperspin crowd hates that HD guy, huh? I see their argument, seems like the guy is making money off of stuff that's available free of charge that other's have put together. Just seems like there's a lot of hate on multiple boards for that guy.   This is a very important part of it. Don't say the monsters under the bed don't exist. Acknowledge them. Than deal them a swift hand of justice.   We'll get one in 2016, Harris is running for Senate than. We could've had one last year but she ran basically unopposed. When election time comes around she touts up all the children she's saved and how, as a woman, she's fought to make places like Marin and Orange county safer places (these are already safe places, for those that don't know) so rich, white people like her. She's also a Tamil, Black, Asian-American woman, so she's got a lot of quota votes going for her.   Go up a size. Or... and I hate to recommend this... but going to cloth diapers fixed it for us. She still wears a disposable during the night since the cloth just can't handle that much pee. Still have to handle the shit though, unless you're using a cloth diaper service.   And our children.   That's typically done to indicate that there's more screen to explore above you. The screen stops scrolling when you hit the edge. Here's a spoiler, but about ten minutes into the game you learn to fly.   Good decision. That's the exact reason to do it, and great job on the success.     and let me tell you, I killed it.  FTFY   The best part about your before and after is that you don't look unpleasantly uncomfortable in your before. Heavy, yes, but you're smiling and you've obviously got some charm or charisma that helps make up for the weight. Despite that, you still lost the weight and look even more charismatic now.   WTF is an XJ6 and why won't you send me one?   Is she nursing? My wife and I had pretty much had no vaginal sex from birth to when she was done with nursing. Lack of lubrication and her being tighter than usual pretty much made it uncomfortable enough for her that we just gave up for a bit.   Of course, there was always butt stuff.   Yes. Yes. Yes so many times. My daughter is 18 months and I let her do this whenever she wants. It's also around this time when it changes from you hugging them to them being able to hug you. I teared up the first time that happened.    Well, [this seems rather fitting](http://i.imgur.com/vCkEWI5.png).  From their website.   Dollar Tree. Pack of two for a buck.

 I'd love to see the Drunk Cory/ Bacon Story!   Flip it and rip it.  Diving.    Beni Benimle Birak by Manga.    At my church there was a kid named Grinnen Barret. Pronounced grin 'n bare it.    It's alright. You might want to check out some prov videos though and see what really good looks like. Might I suggest NachoTHPS and then click on links from there.   	5
 Wow, such a nice pose :)           	4
 I'm what I like to call a 'recovering emetophobic, haha. I got extremely sick and it helped to ....desensitize me, I guess, but before that, I hadn't thrown up in 7 years. I read somewhere that Emetophobics learn to bypass the specific breathing pattern that lets your body know 'it's time to throw up' which I think may have some truth to it, because now even when I /want/ to throw up I cant.   Driving. I'm absolutely terrified to drive. I'm 30 and I've never done the thing. But. I'm working myself up to take my learner's soon....   You too, bro! Be free in your love for T-Swift. She's cute and knows how to sell records, and that's more than I can say about myself, haha. :P (PS Trouble and Shake it Off are undeniably catchy and great.)   UGH I ALMOST INCLUDED THIS ONE IN THE MAIN POST. I dont hate it as much as Bad Blood but close. It's so, so grating and I have to hear it on the radio and then in commercials.    I hate it. I don't judge you for liking it but I hate it so, so very much. It makes me Hulk levels of angry.  	5
 Make sure you take IC or IR trains. L trains take you through the middle of nowhere and it will take hours... Unless you're into looking at cows for ages!    Feel like this is some kind of weird way to convince people Doel and Tihange are good things!!1!   There's a restaurant in antwerp that calls their horse steak a black beauty and it't be-a-utiful   Get an annulment    I eat raw meat quite often but man this is gross...

Charlie Cox is pretty cute   Remember when Louis theroux emailed Do to ask if he could visit and he said they were too busy but sent him a badge... Very busy killing themselves   Belgium tho   Belgium with j'aime la vie in 86 if i'm correct   He was just trying to even out his complexion   Human skewer   Hope he's feeling better after getting those out!

 Yea.  My favorite player.  Guy is an athletic freak.  I never miss warriors,  thunder or Clippers games.    I saw these in person...  Always make sure I go to the thunder games.   [Westbrook 1](https://youtu.be/0Xr-5LVYNNs)  [Westbrook 2](https://youtu.be/vgpfylEYeWI)     - Ronnie prices dunk on Carlos Boozer.  - my girl and I got to go to the bottom of the court and when the players come out. As Isaiah came by us I yelled to him "Bring Crawford, Robinson and Roy".  He did a double take and started laughing and nodded.  Thought that was funny.    Don't feed the trolls   Meet a player?  Favorite moment? Halftime show?   The nba writers are purely entertainment writers like ESPN.  Write for ratings. Most of the time not reliable. It's all speculation.  Rondo fought injuries but who knows if it's over. We needed something to show DMC we are trying. We have an arena opening next year.  We don't want JT to be one of our poster boys.    Instability of an NBA owner who is brand new to the circuit?  Why is this surprising.  He is new.  It takes time.  Players didn't only reject for instability...  CA taxes, small city,  less endorsements,  franchise name,  Championship opportunities, etc. You are purely speculating just like the writers you quote.    Most of our top players came from other teams.  DMC is an exception because he was a superstar.  They are naturally good. Also maybe we saw him as our future and gave him double the developmental focus.    Kmart, Trob, Stauskas, Jimmer and Ben all struggled trying to get a grip. Okc,  Portland and SA all have amazing development results. We should have gutted out whole staff with new management.  Even players who gained some development hit a plateau.  (Kmart, Reke and I'm worried Ben.)  Trading for experienced players who understand the game may translate to changes in development staff and maybe teaching some younger players some things to help mentor.    "I'd play Mclemore at the 3"  Yea..  Let's not. I say this time and time again. Kings have one of the worst development staffs in the league. Everyone always asks "why you trade X, look at him now". Truth is,  until we change things we can't create those players.  Whiteside would not have panned out here just like Lin didn't in Goldenstate.  Stauskas may be Jimmer... May be Ray Allen.  Idk but personally,  he has something in common with Jimmer and that was he was apart of a team that wasn't meant for him. Good luck.   People need to stop trashing the trade. Kings need endorsements for the new arena and they need to sell tickets.  I renewed but I know a few people who didn't after last season. This was a revitalized trade which has given us real hope and I haven't had that in years. (I'm delusional...  I believe we will win the championship every year.)  Personally, I don't feel we need these posts here but you are always allowed to post. Understand that the general consensus of the City,  not just fans,  liked the trade.    Sick PG rotation!    Fite me irl   In all fairness...  Kings got more shit than Ellen Pao this off season. Once the Woj bomb hit,  you guys ran with it and either attacked or downvotes anything kings said and wrote our FO off as dumb. Making dumbass claims of trades for Cousins, it was a nightmare. The trade hit and you guys went nuts.  Saying how shitty we are and how fucked we our.  "trade Cousins,  he deserves better" comments were plenty. Rejections from  people we made attempts for only sweetened the insults. In comes Bellinelli and Rondo. Top it off with some Koufos and maybe some Jsmoove and all of a sudden I only see comments about "Wow gonna be a decent/interesting team" or "can't wait to watch that."    "If you're lucky enough to not get down voted to hell within 5 minutes,  you might last long enough to be insulted mercilessly." - /r/nba    Hi guys. I'm a philosophy major who usually reads some pretty dense stuff. I just finished a long way gone in a day. It reminded me for how much I love reading but also showed how boring some of my books are. What are some good college readings for me? I enjoy biographies, memoirs, intellectual or just plain fun books.  Some of my favorites: Steve Jobs Bio, Long Way Gone, Candide, Thus Spake Zarathustra, Metamorphosis, American Sniper.  Not so much in to mystical fiction books.    Give it a day or so.  I believe he will join the Kings.    Wow.  Shit happens fast.    French fault...  Again...    Maybe...  Because he's a cyclist.    Amazing how many cougars exist on reddit.    Voila*   Josh smith had all star potential in Atlanta. He is was a killer perimeter defender and a stretch  4. He even showed signs of his old form and improved shooting in the playoffs.  Dwill is a poor man's Gerald Wallace.     I realized Rudy Gay and Josh Smith both don't have all star nods. Who are some other surprising snubs?    The bestie exemption most underrated exemption.    Good info thanks   [This dude](https://youtu.be/ncvUNxgkMtw)    That came and went at 17. He's like mid 30s.   Edit: He's definitely 41... Smh   I see he is still alive...    Lol   We land the hawk and we will be the deadliest underdog we have seen in years. Rudy is the man.    He's definitely not the mobster    Gay can. Casspi needs work.  Offensively they are gold    Fuck off bitch    we gonna be great!   FTFY   Restart the rebuild lol   Unbelieveable....  This is ridiculous!  Now what are we gonna do with our 9.5 million in salary cap!  Why go with Tim Duncan and Popavich when you can play with WCS and Karl.    He will be back   No but you can teach him if he is motivated.  Alot of him makes me think of a player with low self esteem.  Super athletic and usually first one down court.  He tore it up when it was IT Cousins and him. Just never really give a huge opportunity.  It shows some thing if Phil Jackson wanted him.    Ten years down the road,  you are gonna realize that this commercialized image of a logo from a band you liked at the time in your youth is in an area that will hinder jobs, careers etc.   My favorite band is OMAM but no way would k ever tattoo a logo especially one as plain as theirs.  Maybe a cool verse that you really enjoy? Something that's meaningful.  Just not the band logo.     7-10 mil min I'd say. We still need Casspi.    Maybe less who knows   Possible.  Yea.  Probable. Who knows.    With ya man... Imagine those highlight dunks with Rondo..  But fuck 5 mil a year haha   Rondo starts.  Collison would be great energy off the bench.  Rondo isn't a bench pg   Good for him.  Good luck dwill   We eating fam   8===D 0:   Open wide   He hasn't been signed and we don't need to go bidding war. Sign him or don't.  I think he could be an asset with Collison.    Casspi will be a great player off the bench to hustle with Collison.   Williams will be killer with Rondo throwing lobs and he still has potential.    We need a 4.  Maybe sign a cheap one.    Wow didn't know this.  Thanks.  What's a good price?    Oh ok lol   I don't really know what set up means   So?    I'm a betting man   I have a beginners Yamaha acoustic.  For some reason when I go to the guitar store,  I can play barre chords great on some Taylors and some more expensive guitars but struggle on my guitar.  Why is this?    JJ barea?    Monta Ellis?    Dirk? Please say it's Dirk..    The ol' igoudala-a-roo   No   Not a bad idea.  I'd consider it but I have a feeling we are gonna go big.  I'd rather Lou and Smith. Depending on cost tho but stuckey is an option.    I like your style    Josh Smith ripped it in the playoffs.    Wow didbt think about that.    Umm...  No.... Think about this long and hard buddy.    No...  There is 490 people here lol      Hi.  My name is Yopeee. I understand you guys are eating with fam. I am in association with the feed the Kings charity. Did you know that every 15 seconds,  part of our FO fucks something up?  This results in insufficient ingestion of food with fam.  You can make a difference. For 15a day,  you can help the Kings sign a FA for a 145mil/1 year contract. We enjoy eating too. Help us eat fam.   *#wehungry*   SHIIIIIIIT! Millennium Falcon this shit    Fuck Bro..  Going pole 2 pole tonight then   Can I come?    [YEAH!](https://youtu.be/Vv2M95Jv68I)    I hear Iverson looking for a team   Offer Lou 2 packs of coke...  Turns us down for 1 12oz. Shasta.    Preach   God damn it   Lou Williams is about to make some money.    You're not even reading what I'm writing...    Read above man. If the signings don't happen like we think...  Then we traded our picks...  Which leaves us unable to build through draft   Like I already stated...  We traded our future "*If and only if*"  it doesn't pan out.  If Rondo and Wes don't work out either by signing or by some reason not playing well or say Rondo leaves or Matthews gets injured...  We may have lower picks than the sixers.  This would be considered losing players unnecessarily, wasting 26 million,  and losing picks assuming shit didn't pan out.    Once again I agree with the trade.  I made a statement saying "6th see isn't winning the superbowl."    Lol correct.  I just don't see the comparison of winning the superbowl to being 6th seed. We may only get 1 or possibly two seasons from Rondo.    No need to tell me to chill lol I'm not upset.    Where did I say anything about JT and Landry being our future?    We gave up 3 picks.  We owe Chicago 1. Stauskas may have been a piece.  All that said...  I like the trade.  But we are banking on championships.  Not 6th seeds.  We were 4th and 6th during 03-04,04-05. Never went passed 1st round.  I have never heard anyone talk about how great we were for bing 4th seed. We were just another basic team on a downside.    We traded and are trading for a championship because building through the draft is no longer and option.    You think a 6th seed is a reason to lose 3 players    3 picks and 26 million dollars?    We sold our future away to be winners.  So no its not a super bowl win..  That would be a temporary pleasure as the next few years put us where we were 3 years ago.  A championship win is a super bowl win. Never seen a parade for sixth seed.  Please don't confuse them.    I don't think I actually know the details?  Anyone have a good source?    We are gambling. Not one person in Sacramento denies this.  Our owner has a fascination with buying low with high potential.  He wants that with Wes and Rondo. To say it wont work in the next two years is a bold statement. Rudy Gay was a "shit"  player and a bad trade...  Worked out great.  Karl was given less than half a season..  We were a winning team with Malone with essentially less talent than we are set to aquire...  Yet we are garbage?   These articles are why the Kings stay shitty.  Who wants to play for a team that's known as the losers. I'm ready to bad news bears this season.  I hope every single person hates on us.  We beat great teams with less.    Absolutley agree!  I just want these two to solidify a playoff caliber starting 5. With that,  we can start landing vets to place on bench like clips and Pierce,  grizzlies and Carter,  etc.    I'm not sure.  You're probably right but I would still like to see what we do with the main two and see what kind of players want to play with them.  Big names may lure some good players.    I know you are. Potentially wait to see who we sign.  If we land bot Wes and Rondo... Maybe sign and trade Evans and Hollins for a decent forward.  Remember we have Rudy as a 4 rotation as well.    Jumping on Biyumbo just scares me a little.  Ptsd from rush signing PF   Understood.  Lots of players also can be productive.  I personally don't want either of them just off of ability..  Add the character issues and it's a big no for me. Just making a point that character issue isn't always a total write off but I'm definitely with you on the legal issues    I did lol that's why I was downvoted   Lol agreed but having trouble with the law doesn't necessarily disqualify them.  I don't think they are for us but I wouldn't base it off character.  Ron Artest did wonders in LA.     97% satisfied.    So did cwebb   You are talking about character issues..  Rondo has one of the worst attitudes towards integrity and loyalty.  He has shown to be very vocal in the media and usually doesn't hold back in player confrontations.  All character issues.  Not so much trouble with the law but still issues.  Yet he may be perfect here.    Lol we are in the running for Rondo...  Next.    I hate college ball for these reasons.  You never know when it comes to ball.  By his analysis...  IT wouldn't be relevant.  So many players slip through  the draft because of this.  I agree WCS isn't the next DJ...  He is the only WCS   Well...  This is awkward.    Why isn't it realistically possible? AP had a torn acl and came back to have a record season.  Wes Matthews only got to where he is by out working players.  He has had to earn and work for this. If anyone can fight to make it, it is Matthews.    No   The gamble is this.  We take a risk.  When you are in the position we are in.  You don't have a choice.       Welcome to the eastern conference finals   Lol I don't want smart...    Eh   I Absolutley will say JT is one of my favorite kings ever.  I say that with the fact in mind that he was at every charity event I have seen.  He hustled constantly and put up with some shitty owners but never blamed the fans.  He has been amazing and we will always appreciate you. Business is business and honestly you need a team to play you more. Good luck.  #34foreverpurple   They had a championship..  Sometimes hotheads are great with each other. Chemistry wise. KG was the same way.  My worry is Karl.    Ha^ha^ha^ha^keep^laughing^ha^ha   Cousins doesn't like anyone who has a personality like his on an opposite team.  Cousins is allllll for people with his passion to win *on* his team. That's Rondo,  Beverly, etc.   I truly believe Cousins wants a bad boys team.  A no bs team who want to win.    Every city has crime.  Check out Hawaii crime.  Unbelievable but beach bums stay because they like the area.  Same with Santa Cruz. I had a gun pulled on me downtown literally 2 months ago by a tweaker. Luckily nothing happened. Drugs are there and people with no money want those drugs. It happens. I'm a decent sized 23 yr old male.  Don't put yourself in positions that leave you vulnerable.    Lpt: stay vigilant, be aware,  be prepared,  be safe.  This is for anywhere.    As a season ticket holder..  Dwill kept me going to alot of games.  Highlight player who was usually up and down the court first. I honestly feel he is a valuable asset to the team.  Like a Gerald Wallace. He has huge upside and a loyal player    We can definitely bring them both back.  Monta and green aren't coming here.  Bring Rondo and sign both. Casspi will be a little more expensive.    I went to tilt.com... Still never received gold   You're yum!       I believe we should sign him 3 years at 3 mil. I believe he will be a late bloomer.  He has athleticism and has shown moments of good play when given opportunities. He reminds me of a Gerald Wallace. I really hope we don't let him slip by.    Nice video.  This will be a big year for Mclemore.  I feel he will have alot of room to play when the D is worried about the post with the towers.      Haha that shit funny   8===D O:   I'm a pretty nice guy...  But I am getting real fed up with this fucking Bull shit.    Shitty title but good video   The trolls come out on the reddit tonight  Not an upvote to be seen.   A kingdom of masturbation.   And it looks like they're the Kings.   Pitchforks are over flowing like the swirling wind inside.   I couldn't keep them even if I tried...   Their lies I see!  So fuck OP!   You can fool all them but you can't fool me!   I need a fork! Where do I go?!    Well I know!  Well I know!!!!   THEY MUST GO!  THEY MUST GO!   FUCK OP DOWN VOTE THAT HO!    THEY MUST GO! THEY MUST GO!   SO MANY FORKS,  YOU CAN SAY NO!   I CAN SAY  THAT OUR PRICES ARE GREAT!   LET THE SALE GO ON!    Lynching never bothered me anyway...         I am not trashing UF by calling it the "*Wal-Mart*"  of MMA gyms.  Kovars is the same kinda way.  Walmart is a multi-billion dollar company based on the one stop shop concept. Kovars expanded alot more than UF even though UF tried but ultimately closed their folsom gym. Uriah is an entrepreneur.   Joe Guerro is not a better boxing coach than Tony Lopez, Gilbert or Juan Lascano. Just a fact.  If you are going for boxing..  Maybe best to go to a boxing gym.   When UF had Juan, Tong and Cassio...  Shit man can't beat it. They all left. UF is still a very top notch gym with extraordinary opportunities...  It would be wrong not to inform people of other options. I have rolled with people at Cassios with UF people.  Trained at judo club while training at UF.  It was $150 for full access when I went there.  This was about a year ago. Times change.  Economy changes. Complimented staff and business and like I said UF Is the best gym if you are really serious. A one stop shop with pro trainers. If you are solo looking for Jiu-jitsu or judo...  It would be the wrong investment.    SG and PG are our priorities. No need to fatten the front court.  I'm looking for starting PG or some bench depth.    Do we still have Reggie Evans lol?    Good player..  Probably a late blooming role player in the future.  Wasn't really go even a whole lot of opportunities    Depends.  Trained there for a year. It is like the Walmart of MMA gyms unless you get in with alpha male.  If you are with alpha male and train in their wrestling etc. You are good to go.   Boxing class was a joke.  Jiu-jitsu wasn't bad. Grappling was okay.  May Thai was good.  Alpha male wrestling was incredible.  Their exposure and ability to put you into a fight is great.  Just depends what you are looking for.   Recommendation  - Jiu-jitsu: Cassio Werneck  - Boxing: idk who is relevant anymore.   - MMA: Karnage  - Wrestling: Ultimate Fitness  - Grappling: Sacramento Judo Club  Check them out depending on what you want.  I left because the boxing was shitty and it was 150. But even as I told them I was leaving...  They worked on my contract and were very professional.  Uriah is an awesome dude. Good luck.         Sacramento judo club is the oldest and a very prestigious club in Sacramento. They have produced Olympic contenders and nationally ranked fighters.  Sambo is rather close to judo.  Give it a look   Ok kinda see it a little..  Damn that took way to much work.    I could just be fucking stupid...  But I don't think your post is grammatically correct.    ... Why you think she is crazy is why your not a photographer   Wait..  What?    Who killed Kennedy   "Bernie likes his bottom bitches on top."   When I broke my arm and had a cast for three months...  You can't wash you arm, barley scratch it and it hen you scratch it with a hanger,  you cut the fuck out of your arms.   But on the day of removal...  When they take off the cast and rub your arm with rubbing alcohol...  That same effect of freshness like drinking water after popping a mint. This is what made me cry.  Thank you.

 Lead exposure is easily mitigated by refraining from handling food at the range, and washing your hands, gun cleaning solvents can be dealt with the same way any other cleaning product is used, by ventilating the area, and unless these doctors and the administration are advocating for removing suppressors from being regulated as NFA Title II devices, I call shenanigans on the notion that they actually care about hearing damage in any meaningful way.  Furthermore, any and all health issues can easily be dealt with by simply distributing a pamphlet that covers basic gun safety, storage, and cleaning procedures with zero need to actually record such information in a database that can be accessed by an army of medical professionals and faceless bureaucrats.   Video set to private. Hopefully someone downloaded a copy...    It's actually a point of pride with them.  As the Ministry of Truth in 1984 said: **IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH**   Kellerman***n***.  His name ends with two ns.  As does Josh Sugarmann's name.  Sorry for being a pedant.   Chip away at it incrementally.   For instance, The American Silencer Association has been slowly getting laws passed at the state level to make suppressor use more acceptable and mainstream.    Exactly this. She's a nobody looking to pad her reel out with some pro-bono work for a graboid non-profit.  She probably pitched the idea to them, and they ate it up.   I doubt they thought it would cause controversy, because these people are so utterly dense that they didn't even stop to consider how this would play out in the real world.   They don't know, or care about the law; it doesn't matter because gun control is all about feelings and emotion.   That's just the place if you like Cummingtonite!   LOL!  Stay classy, /r/guns!   Did I miss something?  Have they moved on to idolizing SKSs now too?     I bet your stories are hilarious.  There's nothing more cringy/hilarious than a military officer who has the rank but not the knowledge.   /r/guns only likes gun photos if they're taken with an outdated potato phone with poor auto-focus, and the subject matter is limited to box-stock Glocks or Mosin Nagants.  The fact that you went to the time and effort to assemble a rifle that makes you happy, as well as the fact that you're apparently skilled with a camera all but guaranteed that the gaggle of no-talent ass-clowns at /r/guns would hate it.   I'venever seen that photo of the soldiers facing off over the line. That is really intense.  I've always liked the picture of the East German soldier jumping the barbed wire in order to defect.  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/92/Conrad-schumann.jpg   That's a grate idea. Like having your own personal primetime.   Amazon has already started doing this for some movies on their streaming service.   Always remember, when gun control fails, the solution is always more gun control!    "Assault weaponsjust like armor-piercing bullets, machine guns, and plastic firearmsare a new topic. The weapons' menacing looks, coupled with the public's confusion over fully automatic machine guns versus semi-automatic assault weaponsanything that looks like a machine gun is assumed to be a machine guncan only increase the chance of public support for restrictions on these weapons. In addition, few people can envision a practical use for these weapons."  -Josh Sugarmann, founder of the Violence Policy Center, "Assault Weapons and Accessories in America," 1988  That's just one quote. There are plenty more where that came from.   A lot of average Joes support gun control because that's what the media and their leaders tell them is good.   However, at the highest levels, make no mistake, the officials and policy makers who support gun control aren't just simply misinformed. They are outright lying to you, me, and the American people.  To people like Dianne Feinstein and Michael Bloomberg, gun control is purely an issue of instituting policies that consolidate power in the hands of a wealthy and well-connected political elite.    The claim is that by limiting people to only one gun per month that it would stop people from buying a case of cheap pistols and then turning around and trafficking them to buyers in states with stricter laws.      It's not like there isn't precedent.   Nearly every sheriff in Colorado said the same thing about the gun control laws passed there.   Speaking very broadly, the "pro" version of a pistol will possibly include the following upgrades:  Longer barrel Better trigger Upgraded sights (adjustable and or fiber optic) Flared magazine well  Extended magazine release  Which options show up will depend on the make/model of pistol.   In a lot of cases, terms like "pro," "target," "sport," "competition," and especially "tactical" have been so diluted by marketing hype that they don't really mean anything any more.       The guy had multiple people at gun point in a standoff situation that lasted hours.   Had he wanted to kill them, he could have easily done so, at his leisure, even with a pump action shotgun.   Hell, using a shot timer, I've actually run side-by-side drills of firing a pump vs semi-auto shotgun, and the difference in the rate of fire amounted to a couple of seconds.   A two-second difference to do a mag dump doesn't matter in a situation where the perpetrator has the better part of two days to do as he pleases.    Why does fruit cake have such a bad rap?   Well, try some fruit cake and you will have your answer.             Because the people who say stuff like that are the sort of coward who would be completely incapable of using a gun in self defense.  They then project their abject cowardice onto everyone else.   It's a fake.  http://www.therightperspective.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Obama_Limo2.jpg   Outgoing Senate Democrats to America: "Fuck you!"      Aren't you the slack-jawed halfwit who thinks that a single mother should be taken away from her children, convicted of a felony, and thrown in prison because she dared to cross a state line with a handgun?   So you don't have an actual plan, but you do know that your not-an-actual plan doesn't involve anything like actually participating in any civic proceedings.   I know! You should totally call me a statist a few more times, I bet that will get our rights back toot-sweet.    In Frum's mind, shooting can't possibly be fun.   The only way to have fun is by joining a posh country club and lounging around while wearing a sweater with the sleeves tired around his shoulders.      If you've got a surefire plan to win back all of our list gun rights by next week, I'm all ears.    If public perception changed so that there's was widespread understanding that violent crime is at record lows, it would make things far more difficult for anti-gun advocates to make their case.   However, anti-gun groups and officials would remain largely unchanged in their goals because if you get then to answer honestly, they support gun control not because of crime or violence, but because of an over-arching need to exercise control over others.   Crime is simply the pretext. An obsessive need to control others is the actual reason.          Probably one of those perky high school students who plays a couple of sports and think she's got it all figured out because she gets good grades and volunteered at a homeless shelter once.         The FBI Uniform Crime Report is released annually, and it has pretty much all the stats on crime, including a breakdownxof the types of weapons used.  The CDC has some information on violent crime and self defense as well.   Even if that's the long term goal (and it would be a multi-generational undertaking), there's no point in advocating for it right now.  Our rights were lost a little bit at a time, and that's the only way we will regain them.   We owe it to ourselves and our civil liberties to policy e our own ranks.   I didn't move goal posts, though I admit I should have perhaps been more specific, as it is the DNC and higher ups in the party that hate private gun ownership, at the state and local levels the democrats tend to be, if not more aligned with their constituents, then at least pragmatic about placating them.   But any presidential contender for the Democratic party will bow to anti-gun pressure, and that pressure will come from the party bosses, donors, and senior members serving in high-level elected positions.   Hell, based on the posts here, Webb had tried to play both sides of the fence on background checks, claiming to support them for gun shows, but not other private party transfers.   I guarantee you that stance, milquetoast as it is, will harden to a full on support for Bloomberg-style mandatory checks.  I will again point to the DNC stance on the 2nd Amendment.   It's pure anti-rights BS with a thin candy shell so that the credulous will swallow it.    It's interesting that the actual text from the DNC actually makes no policy recommendations for preserving or expanding 2nd amendment rights, but does make several policy recommendations for curbing them.   If friendly phrasing is all it takes to convince you that Democrats aren't a threat, then I'm not sure there's anything I can do to convince you otherwise, because you're clearly more interested in buying into fantasy than in dealing with political reality.    Exactly this.    If he doesn't fit the party line mold, then it's highly unlikely he'll receive meaningful support from the DNC.   If he gets the nod, the DNC will require him to change his stance on guns.  You can see the same thing in places like Colorado. Hickenlooper was a moderate pro-business Dem who's stance on guns was neutral-to-pro, right up until he started getting calls from the VP and Bloomburg.    STATE level Dem systems may grudgingly acknowledge gun rights, but the national party hates them.   Go read the DNC party platform regarding guns if you don't believe me.    That's true.   Let's just say I have a fairly cynical outlook on the American justice system and it's tendency to reward plaintiffs with obscene settlements resulting from frivolous lawsuits.    Politics is won by the people who show up.   Their social media presence isn't what matters.  In fact, it really is a joke.  What matters is that Bloomberg has effectively unlimited resources to put boots on the ground to gather signatures, and then back that up with major ad buys on radio, television, and the Internet.  The problem is compounded by the fact that he's doing all of this in multiple states and none of the pro gun groups have the resources to meaningfully counter his strategy.  Money buys low information voters.   If he gets elected, he'll do exactly what the party bosses tell him to do, and he'll do it with a smile because he fully knows that it would have been impossible to win the presidency without the support of the party.  The Democratic party hates the notion of private gun ownership, and they hate gun owners. When push comes to shove, even an ardently pro-gun Democrat will toe the party line if it allows him to keep or advance his position.   If this is a civil case, I expect Bushmaster will settle this out of court.  If it goes to trial I would fully expect them to lose.   These kinds of stories need to get crossposted to Nevada-related web venues so they get some idea of what they're in for.   Replace the honking with creepy hissing.  Having geese hiss at you is unsettling.   Do you think that's money you're spending?   You think that, but in Heck, the only flavor of jelly is orange marmalade.    This sounds like the setup to an episode of Better Off Ted.   Hey, if you think 3 years in federal prison is a reasonable punishment for a completely victimless crime, feel free to believe that.  But it makes you a horrible person.  But we already know that about you, don't we?   I'm not a member of the Tea party, and you haven't yet made a convincing argument for why an African American single mother of two should have to spend three years in prison.  You really suck at making convincing arguments, don't you?   Its already part of the law as Ms. Allen was placed into the diversionary program after a public outcry was raised.   Protip: actually reading the linked article is one way to avoid looking like an imbecile, which, in case you're not aware, you are.    We've already established that most people are in favor of incorporating and/or exercising discretion in cases like this.   Continually repeating the same thing over and over like a parrot isn't a tactic that's clearly not convincing anyone.   Perhaps, and this is just a thought, perhaps you should try using a different approach if your want to actually convince me that you're right.   Of course, you won't, and will continue to repeat stupid things that are easily shown to be fallacious.    They're narcissists, pure and simple.   Nice try.  I'm simply pointing out the racist outcome of a law you support.  I'll also note that you've completely failed to articulate why throwing Shaneen Allen in prison is in the best interest of society or safety.  All you've done in this entire thread is make a fallacious appeal to popularity (what's hilarious is that you can't even make that claim, as Ms. Allen was put into a diversion program AFTER a massive public outcry at the injustice of imprisoning her.)  But, hey, you're the one who's already voiced support for making it a felony to run a stop sign on an empty road.  In short, you're a dimwit, and not even your fellow graboid lunatics have tried to make the case that she should be convicted of a felony, because anyone with the least bit of tolerance or empathy can see the injustice of the situation.  Please, continue, as I do so love sharing your posts with others as an example of the pathological narcissism inherent to anti-gun culture.   Send him this article  http://www.wired.com/2013/02/ar-15/all/   That isn't the issue. The issue at hand is that you're in favor of imprisoning African American single mothers. I have to wonder if you're even aware of your privilege or just a racist, but that's par for the course when it comes to people who hate civil rights.   Jesus Christ! What a blast from the past!  You've clearly been stewing about this for some time.  I had completely forgotten about this discussion.  Maybe next time you argue in favor of throwing African American single mothers in prison, you could manage to be a little more prompt with your responses.   The thing that surprised me about the movie wasn't that it was a hagiography for Walt Disney (they show him doing and saying some things that come across as a bit unethical) but that the film makers opted to turn the movie into a bit of a redemption story about Travers, when in fact she was, by all accounts, evidently a terrible person.    The thing that surprised me about the movie wasn't that it was a hagiography for Walt Disney (they show him doing and saying some things that come across as a bit unethical) but that the film makers opted to turn the movie into a bit of a redemption story about Travers, when in fact she was, by all accounts, evidently a terrible person.    They actually foreshadowed that he wasn't a drug addict, but very strong-willed with that scene where he pulls out two cigarettes that he's had stashed away for years.  Other than that, I agree that it was a pretty terrible film.   And even then, the commentary was about as nuanced as the views of that one kid in high school.  You know, the one from an upper middle class background who read The Communist Manifesto, and then promptly failed to grow a beard.   Translation: Someone shit himself, so we should make everyone wear a diaper   The fortis looks very nice, but price-wise, it's almost in carbon fiber territory.   No wonder the antis want to ban guns.   They would be completely incapable of making a holiday greeting even 1% as awesome as this.    Thank you for proving my point.  It's hilarious how you're willing to contort yourself into all sorts of laughable positions in order to avoid defending a law and punishment you know to be morally untenable.  Please, continue, as I quite enjoy sharing your posts on other forums with people who find you as hilarious as I do.  Once again, please explain why you think an African American mother of two who's committed a completely victimless crime should have to lose her children, spend 3 years in prison, and live the rest of her life with a felony conviction all because of your distorted view of the racist founders and a republican governor?  Thanks.    No, the law in New Jersey allows for leniency in a diversion program, but the prosecutor chose to throw the book at someone who had harmed no one.  You said nothing in support of the diversion program, in essence endorsing throwing the book at her.   Then, in order to demonstrate what a pathetic coward you are, you won't actually defend your position, rather choosing to hide behind a claim that clearly the law is just because the citizens of New Jersey want such a law (which manages to be a fallacious appeal to popularity, as well as a complete non-sequitur).  Either defend your position for imprisoning her, or admit that you are wrong.   What the people of New Jersey think isn't the issue here, as what we're concerned with is why YOU support throwing a mother of two in prison for a victimless crime.    That's hilarious.   You're so wrapped up in being offended that you actually think that having your sensibilities offended makes you a victim.   Of course, you'll deny this because it's perfectly absurd, but your inability to actually produce a victim only managed to highlight your stupidity.   As for running stop signs, I have to ask: do you believe that a felony conviction and three years in prison is an acceptable punishment?    So you are admitting that you're perfectly OK with locking up a mother of two for committing a victimless crime.      Much empathy.  Such tolerance.   Wow.    Not sure. I was under the impression that it was just the raw NICS numbers, and that they didn't differentiate then based on the reason for conducting the check.    So you would have her thrown in jail for committing a completely victimless crime?  And here I thought liberals were supposed to be tolerant.  I guess the marketing is better than the product in your case.   Also, if you purchase more than one gun at the same time, they only run one background check.  However, NICS checks get run for reasons other than gun purchases, such as when people get concealed carry permits, and at least one state, Kentucky, runs NICS checks on all CCW holders once a month, which is going to skew the numbers.  As you point out, it's not a one-to-one relationship, but it's an enormous freaking indicator of just how popular guns are.   Wow! Phenomenal photograph!       Gun control is the solution to the problems it causes.  It's the perfect example of a self-licking ice-cream cone.      Yeah, in real life, balance is applied to silencers by making them expensive and throwing up a bunch of bureaucratic hoops to jump through in order to get one.  It's a little-known fact that Battlefield 4 had this in the beta, but the "filling out ATF Form 4, getting an FBI background check, and waiting 9 months" portion of the game turned out to be hugely unpopular, so in the interest of keeping the game fun, they just gave suppressors an accuracy penalty instead.   That's very odd.  I do have to say, thanks for writing this article. Seeing something like suppressors demystified in a venue geared toward techies is a very positive thing.  I do have one quibble with this bit, though:  Suppressing a rifle while hunting is one thing; the use cases for suppressing pistols are a lot narrower. "That's the hardest one," Schauble said when we asked why anyone would need or want a suppressed pistol.   Frankly, I think it's pretty easy to justify suppressing a pistol. If you've ever trained someone who's never shot a handgun before, one of the hardest things for a new shooter to overcome is their sensitivity to the noise and recoil of the gun when it fires.  Here you are, telling them to concentrate on the front sight, and taking the time to coach them on proper trigger pull, and for them to be able to do that, they have to overcome the instinctive human reaction to be surprised and a little scared when it results in a very loud noise and movement.  Coaching a completely new shooter is made much, much easier with the addition of a suppressor to a handgun because it removes the most anxiety-inducing part of the whole experience.  It also makes it a lot easier to coach the new shooter, because you don't have to wear hearing protection, which can make it harder for the new shooter to understand.  Again, thanks for this article, overall, it's a really excellent introduction to the topic of suppressors for an audience who may have never seen them outside of the movies or video games.   I post stuff here with the hope that it will be shared by others who find it to be relevant, so, please feel free to share the link far and wide!   A transcript of the full memo can be found here:  http://hunting-washington.com/smf/index.php?topic=166188.0               My guess is that if the signatures turn out to be mostly valid, they'll allow the ballot initiative to move forward despite minor paperwork irregularities.   That said, I'm glad to see them holding Bloomberg's feet to the fire in any way possible.       But they didn't pass those laws!   See! The antis are "reasonable" and willing to "compromise"!      Exactly this.  Even if the journalism is unbiased (which it isn't) the fact that they're beating a continuous drum about it only manages to act as a way to keep gun control in front of the public, and scared.   Speaking as someone who's made an on-the-clock cold bore shot on a target at 890 yards with a borrowed rifle*, I'm going to simply ignore your attempts to insult my marksmanship abilities.  That said, let's pretend for a moment that you're right, and "no one needs more than 12 rounds."  Please explain how your perceived "need" makes it perfectly justifiable to arrest, charge, try, convict, and imprison someone for having a plastic box that you consider to be unnecessary?  Furthermore, please explain how your support for throwing people in prison for owning a plastic box doesn't qualify you as a supporter of gun control.  Thanks.  *Not trying to brag. That's only one thing on a list of many that I've been told is "impressive" that I simply consider above-average.    Nope. Most AR mag manufacturers, as well as the makers of almost all other magazines for pretty much every make, model, and caliber of gun don't stamp dates on their magazines.  As written, the law is completely unenforceable, a fact that was ignored by the legislature, despite being pointed multiple times by nearly every Sheriff in the state, many thousands of voters, and anyone else who wasn't being paid off by Michael Bloomberg's cronies.   You're the one that employed antagonistic rhetoric and caps in your post. Clearly he upset you. There's no harm in owning the fact that you're emotionally upset.  As for your opinion on gun control, your stated support for Magpul's leaving the state, as well as support for the magazine law really says all that needs to be said with regards to your stance on gun control.  There's nothing wrong with being anti-gun. If that's what you believe, at least have the decency and courage to own the position and state your support for those laws unequivocally, instead of trying to hide behind vague wording and innuendo.   If you want reduced recoil and better control with an AR10, there are several things you can do, and here they are in escalating order of complexity:  1.) Get a better compensator. Look at something like the Bennie Coolie Comp or JP Tank Brake.  2.) Install an adjustable gas block. This will allow you to dial in the right amount of gas that gets siphoned off to cycle the gun.  3.) Install a low-mass bolt carrier, like the one offered by JP.  4.) Install a buffer with tungsten weights.  5.) Shoot light-weight bullets. 135 grain bullets will go a long way to taming recoil on an AR10.  6.) Employ proper shooting technique.  7.) Get in the gym and lift weights. Seriously.  Despite the fact that they look like an AR15, AR10s are a completely different animal. In a stock configuration, they can and will have a much heavier recoil impulse than a stock AR15.  However, if you put the time and effort in to tailoring the rifle's operating system and ammunition, you can reduce recoil by a tremendous amount.  A few months ago, I had the opportunity to shoot an AR10 that had most of the modifications done that I've listed above, and it was almost as low-recoil as shooting a JP CTR-2.  Double taps were extremely easy, and the rifle handled very, very well. So AR10 recoil can be tamed, it just takes effort.   If that's the case, why did Magpul bother to put effort into fighting the passage of the laws in the first place?    The company had decided by December 2012 to build a state-of-the-art facility in Broomfield, about 15 miles from Erie, but pivoted after the passage of Democratic gun-control bills in March.  TIL Broomfield is in Wyoming and/or Texas.   Regardless of whether or not they're a necessity, supporting a position that would imprison people for owning firearms and/or firearms accessories is morally untenable.   Typical behavior for a gun control fan. But for name-calling or deliberate misrepresentation, you'd have nothing to say on the topic at all!   Magazines don't actually have the date stamped on them. Magpul stamps the date on theirs for QC reasons, but there are probably about a dozen other makers of *just* AR magazines who don't stamp dates or serial numbers on them.   Nothing in my post would indicate that I feel personally attacked.  In fact, judging by your angry attack on /u/Gun_Defender, if anyone here is lashing out emotionally, it's you.  Frankly, I'm amused by your perceived need to back-pedal away from your support of gun control.   Ah, yes. Here we have a perfect example of the mindset of the typical gun control fan.  Horrendously narcissistic, completely ignorant, and utterly angry that any person (or in this case, company) would dare to contradict them.   They did try to work within the legal system and were completely, totally, rebuffed by a legislature who was completely uninterested in facing the facts of how unenforceable and idiotic their law was, on top of how damaging it was to a solid company with hundreds of employees.   They put a poorly-worded, hastily drafted manufacturers' exception in at the last minute, but the Magpul reps said that it still put a massive liability on them, and that the law still would have made it illegal for them to do things like transfer magazines to freight drivers to move them out of state.      The interesting implication here is that Magpul has been operating in violation of the Colorado magazine ban on a literally industrial scale since the ban was passed.    Picture of the author.   http://www.tinyurl.com/lngwczw   They walk among us...   So, what would that be?  A blurry potato photo of Dianne Feinstein?   Such a polite young man!       Why would they sell new Pythons at $700 when they could easily sell them for twice that due to pent up demand?      Except you didn't fully address my post in a timely manner, and your entire presence here, from your user name to your posting style, is based purely on trolling, so you'll have to excuse me for scoffing at your claims of honest intellectual engagement.   Don't expect me to believe that your turd is a donut just because you put some frosting on it.    Two days to post a response?   That's poor trolling, Lou.   What's really hilarious about this is that Gruber's comments apply most directly to the people who bought into Obamacare, and work to actually vindicate the people who were skeptical of it.    Most likely things that would fall under the AOW category, things like pen guns, zip guns, cell phone guns etc.    Technology has changed! Someone like Ben Franklin could never have envisioned such devastating technology as the pot-bellied stove.    Is it possible to lack self awareness while being a troll at the same time?    You. I like you.      Congratulations.  You managed to dig up one law that was passed that allows any person to throw someone into the justice system, causing them to lose their rights, with zero actual evidence of being suicidal.  Are you really so dim-witted that you expect me to believe that law will actually have any meaningful effect on suicide rates?   Is she that stupid, or just that obvious of a troll?   And not a single proposal from the graboid camp would do a single thing to address suicide, so quit with the crocodile tears.    If the raw number of gun owners is going down, please explain the explosion in people attending novice-level safety courses, the explosion in construction of new ranges, and the continued increase in people acquiring concealed carry permits.    How dare he possess a plastic box that holds more than an arbitrary number of objects without first getting permission from the state!   Throw the fucking book at him!    I keep forgetting that legislation shouldn't be based on things like efficacy, enforceability, equal respect for civil rights or reason.   You're right, laws should be based on feels.    For the cost of 1 AR15, you can mill out as many 80% receivers as you like.  There's a difference.   If they actually cared about stopping criminals, they'd work to implement a simple and inclusive plan that would enlist gun owners in *helping* to prevent criminals getting their hands on guns, rather than treating all gun owners like criminals.  For example, most states mark the driver's licenses for people who are under 21 so it's easy for anyone to ascertain at a glance whether they are of legal drinking age.  Implementing a similar plan where everyone's ID is marked so that someone who is  looking to sell a gun can learn whether the person they're dealing with is a prohibited person or not would be far more effective, cheaper, and easier to implement than the so-called "universal background check" schemes that have been pushed by the likes of Bloomberg.  Unfortunately, this isn't actually about preventing criminals from getting guns. If it were, they would actually bother to prosecute the thousands of NICS checks that come back negative on convicted and violent prohibited persons every year.   So, I have a few concerns about the legislation you evidently support.  Does it address the problems that were seen in the Colorado and Washington laws?  You know, like how those laws would make you a criminal for loaning a rifle to a friend for a hunting trip or competition?  Does it fix the prices on background checks, thereby ensuring that no gun dealers will actually be interested in conducting background checks on any transfers except for the ones they conduct on the guns they sell in their shops?  Does it address issues like what happened in Colorado last year when it turned out flood victims who had lost their homes were inadvertently criminalized for transferring their gun collections to friends for safe keeping?  Does it make it a crime to let someone handle a firearm without a background check at a venue other than on a gun range operated by a for-profit enterprise, thereby criminalizing you if you loan your gun to a buddy at a range operated by a non-profit (as most shooting clubs are), on public land, or on private property?  Does the proposed legislation inadvertently discriminate against couples in non-traditional marriages by prohibiting transfer of a firearm without a background check between gay or lesbian couples, while allowing the same sorts of transfers to occur between heterosexual couples?  Does the legislation you support include common-sense exemptions on transfers, for example, those who've already successfully passed a background check in order to acquire a concealed carry permit?  In short, would you care to share the text of the actual legislation that you feel so strongly about?   Thanks.   There are plenty of discussions about using time travel to change history for the better.  Forget that.  How would you change history for the lulz?   This guy is a one-man Open Carry Texas.   There's a psychological issue at play, and in most cases, from what I can tell, it's Narcissistic Personality Disorder.   Relevant:  http://chainsawsuit.com/comic/2010/07/29/in-defense-of-guns/   My typical response to that line of thinking is something to the effect of  "I completely agree. Fuck the disabled and elderly. They clearly have no right to self-defense."      Thanks.  Please do continue to debate your mental simulation of me.   I'm really busy today and can't really spare the time to engage with you.    You seem to be doing an awesome job of debating the version of me that lives solely in your head.   Carry on!    too sexy for that poptart.   *BEEP! BOOP!*  **DOES NOT COMPUTE, IRRATIONAL, IRRATIONAL!**  You can always tell you've won an exchange with /u/barbadosslim when his posts start to resemble something that would be said by a computer in a B-movie from the 1960s.  :-)   "you're"   Thanks for complying with my simple request.   Do you plan to stop posting unfactual, shopworn antigun talking points at any time in the near future?  Because, frankly, you're not posting anything that hasn't been debunked a million times before, and frankly, its boring.  What's it like being an earnest troll?   Guns in the hands of criminals facilitate murder and other crimes. Guns in the hands of responsible people facilitate suicide. Guns in the hands of irresponsible people facilitate accidents. Even self-defense killing is far from desirable. Even responsible gun owners put others at risk when they fire in self defense.  And yet, guns are fired hundreds of millions of times more per year for reasons that are completely legal than they are used for mayhem.  Of course, you also don't want to breach the fact that they're used for self-defense and defense of others around 1-2million times per year.  Furthermore, in your zeal to hate on gun owners, and your wish to disarm them, you demonstrate that everyone who posts here, who's ever used a firearm in self defense, is someone who you wish was dead.  Yeah you don't like me, I remember. I'm just going to start trimming the inane rants out of the quoted text when I respond.  For some, it's easier to pretend to ignore the truth when it stings them.   Of course it does. But you're neglecting the net effect of guns, which is to make everyone less safe.  Except they don't. What's it like being wrong *all* the time? Does your mother dress you in the morning?  Since I am not making an argument based on the contents of any instruction manuals, this isn't really a good point.  It's perfectly relevant, because you don't even understand the most basic facts of a subject you claim to be an expert on, and your lack of understanding, real-world experience, or even an open-minded willingness to engage in a forthright dialogue (as opposed to pathetically sub-par trolling) only manages to underscore the fact that you are clearly as ignorant as you are opinionated.  Frankly, I'm a bit embarrassed for you.   The ability to use a gun in self-defense does make one safer, and frankly, I don't think that someone who's never taken the time to actually read the instruction manual that comes with a firearm are qualified in any way, shape, or form to pontificate on who should, or should not, be prohibited from owning a gun.   I think it would be better to get out in front of it.  Draft the legislation, get it passed and put in the books, so that way when the Bloomberg money machine rolls into town to try to pass more onerous restrictions regarding background checks, the response will be a collective shrug followed by a "we already passed a background check gun bill last year."     Once upon a time, I was in a pawn shop where an old guy was trying to buy a gun.  I over heard the conversation between him and the clerk, and it turned out he had marked down that he'd been dishonorably discharged from the military, and had marked that down on the 4473.  The clerk told him he couldn't sell him a gun, and sent him on his way.  Do I think that this particular sad old man should have been sent to prison?  Of course not.  But what's the point of having a law on the books, especially a law that would let you catch criminals with violent histories dead to rights for trying to acquire the means to commit violence if no one is going to throw them in prison for it?  The lack of enforcement on that front is an utter embarrassment to the entire structure of the NICS system, and no one wants to point this out (or, at least here, pedants want to dick around with semantic word games.)   Now you're shifting goal posts.  You started out pointing out that 1/3 of NICS checks that fail do so for erroneous reasons.  Of course no one this side of Michael Bloomberg would advocate throwing those people in jail.  Furthermore, studies have shown that the prosecution rates for NICS violations are very, very minimal, and that includes prohibited persons who've committed violent felonies.  If the powers that be were half as concerned about stopping criminals from getting guns as they claim, that would be a really easy way to stop it right there.    Note my first sentence:  Make sure that *criminals* are prosecuted if they fail a NICs check.   Yes, it does. If a majority of people believe that having a gun makes them safer, then they are much less likely to support restrictions on firearms ownership.  If this headline is true, then it makes it just that much harder for gun control supporters to pass restrictive legislation.   The kind of people who get a degree in elementary education.    There are entire sub reddits devoted to it.    One of the stupid things about the current system is that lying on the forms, or being a prohibited person who tries to but a gun is a federal crime, yet those crimes are rarely prosecuted.   There's no point in even having the current NICS system if you're not going to even bother arresting convicted felons for trying to buy a gun.    Make sure that criminals are prosecuted if they fail a NICs check.   Then, push for a law to mark drivers licenses and other forms of ID so that you can tell, at a glance, whether a prospective buyer is a prohibited person or not.   There would be almost zero cost associated with implementing this plan, and the only reason to oppose it would be because you're an authoritarian.          One of the best comedy call backs of all time was when they recreated this scene in Arrested Development.      That line of thinking is possibly the most idiotic thing I've read in the last week.   Religious fundamentalists are truly an albatross around the neck of the republican party.    Merrifield's victory was completely unsurprising given how jerrmandered that district is in favor of the Democratic party.   On top of that, Herpin isn't exactly a political genius.    Every sperm is sacred!   Wow. They kept people occupied for the whole 30 seconds it took to read the proposal and vote it down.  Even by pro life protester standards that's some truly idiotic thinking.   Nope.   I'm sorry, but a system based on evaluating signatures is a laughably terrible way to "secure" your voting system.  Even if there is no fraud, the system is functionally broken because the signature verification method is woefully inadequate for verifying ballots cast by people other than the intended recipient.  Nor does it stop ballot harvesting or other, more brazen methods, like false registration.  But, hey, let the downvotes commence because voicing legitimate concerns about a problem with Team Blue policies mean you're an evil Koch brother zombie tea party racist.   I guess I'd be upset if I lacked basic reading comprehension skills, too.  At least you have the word "moustachio" in your name, which is mildly amusing.   Like a free ride when you've already paid, hoser.    That's exactly why I posted it.  Granted, I should have been more explicitin stating the connection in the title, and if the mode feel the need to remove the post, I'm not going to get butthurt about it.   7.62x39 is a poor choice for any kind of long range as its not a very flat shooting cartridge.   Get a .223 and it will cover all your bases except for deer hunting.   If you absolutely must have a gun in a legal deer cartridge, get one in 300 blackout, but realize it's not going to be a great cartridge at longer range, and will cost more than  .223.   You can't read it?  I thought even the most basic of simpletons could grasp plain English.    Do you need me to explain how discussion threads work, or should we just assume you're baked, and will remember how they work in the morning?   There very likely would be market demand for fuel efficient cars if oil industry subsidies didn't keep gas prices artificially low.    This is such a bummer.  RIP, Tom.   I think it's hilarious that my quote from The Simpsons garnered a bunch of downvotes.  	176

So? are you an idea person or are you a support? Someone who creates an idea in their head or someone who helps realise it in front of a camera?   You know you love movies, that is 90% of the work done. You never have to work a job you hate because you're unsure of your passion.    What are you good at that you want to do alot of professionally and how can that be involved in filmmaking?   Check this trailer out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hYlB38asDY     Note the music and the cuts. Then note the changes in musical tone, the music ends when the action/trauma begins then once that's over the score swells up around 0m50s. Study this trailer for a bit. Notice how the volume changes and you can hear the actor, oftentimes the music remains but very much in the background.   :-(   The lord of the rings: The Two towers.

This is the only life you're gonna get. No retries, no do overs. What do you want to dive into and commit to for the rest of your life.

Do you set the toilet paper towards you or away?   A moment of clarity.   No one should go through life doing what they don't want to do, you should sit down with a clear mind and allow yourself to fantasize how your life could be better, then go out and work to achieve that.   Note: This does not apply to any Hitlers reading this.   This is a stupid question.  	109
          More than likely she was charged with a different crime and she took a plea to disorderly conduct as part of a plea. Disorderly conduct [(NY PL 240.20)](http://law.onecle.com/new-york/penal/PEN0240.20_240.20.html) is a violation, considered less than a crime in NY. It is a common practice in NYC for a plea to disorderly conduct to be made even though the facts do not establish the elements of the disorderly conduct offense.   Do you promise?   Under New York state law choosing the wrong apartment is not protected. If the screams were fabricated and the 911 call was for a different apartment than they had no reason to enter, the defendant had a constitutional right to slam the doors in their faces, and anything observed or recovered or statements made after they violated that constitutional right would be suppressed. A short Daily News article is far from reporting all the claims any side is making. I guarantee the arraignment alone had more facts than this article. But as I said above, "I await further information to determine if that is actually what happened though."   The point I was making was that if the police lied about the child being injured (which is still not settled) then I have no reason to believe they were telling the truth about hearing screams. It is also not clear if the 911 call was for that apartment. From the defense attorney's comments it appears the defense's claim is that the police went to the wrong apartment, dragged the woman out without reason or cause, and then created their story later to cover up their mistakes. As of now we do not have enough facts to determine the truth.  I'm well aware how often these issues come up. I practice criminal law.   That would only be true if the police's account of the situation is accurate. See my [reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/2cegez/nypd_officers_drag_naked_brooklyn_woman_from/cjf9gbr) below.   I admit I did misread the article to the extent that I thought the statement came from ACS and not the defense attorney. I agree if the situation occurred in the manner you describe: the police hear screaming and see a child with injuries that that would fit as an exigent circumstances. I await further information to determine if that is actually what happened though. Until then I will reserve judgment on all.   You are assuming that the cops were so nice and pleasant. Frankly, why should they give it a shot? Their rights exist for a reason. They did nothing to the officers and did not commit any crimes. Also, I have no reason to believe the officers behaved in a reasonable way to begin with. First, it appears that are willing to lie about the situation considering that ACS concluded that there were no injuries to the 12 year old as the police claimed. Second, based upon my own experiences in court rooms I know that under these circumstances the police are rarely courteous and/or helpful. Why should a civilian, within his or her rights, be more polite than the professionals paid to uphold the law?   Well the Supreme Court would disagree with you and so would much of the case law that followed after [Payton v. New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_v._New_York). In Payton the Court found that absent exigent circumstances the home cannot be entered without a warrant or without permission of the homeowner. Here, based upon the ACS statement (There were no injuries to the child as alleged in the complaint) and as of the facts now known it appears the 911 call was to a different apartment (the 911 call came from a different apartment on an upper floor  and cops went to Stewarts door by mistake). There is no mention of a warrant and there were no exigent circumstances therefore the door could be slammed in the officers' faces.   Because if you are not committing a crime and they do not have a warrant you have a constitutionally protected right to slam the door in their faces.   How many bills can it hold?              	17

 That day was my father's birthday, being from Costa Rica, he didn't care at all of the NFL playoffs. So, he wanted to go to the movies, we saw The Hobbit.  Watched the first half of the game before the movie and thought "ok, I think it's better if I stop watching". Couldn't believe the score when I came out of the room    Love it. Next you have to do an eye tracker graph   	2
 Link? and Pic?   But he never wore a black hoodie. He was not a part of most of the 5 listed episodes. He doesn't fit into the anagram Mona gave the liars.   The actress playing Cece has already stated she's appearing in the finale and so did Lucas and we saw Jason. The actor for Wren never said he'd be making an appearance. Never was seen on set. Never was seen in this whole season. I think it's clear by now Wren is not A.   Sorry Wren theorists, but Wren is not Big A.   no it's lucas.   Is that the dress from the instagram post? Ugh my brain! #Livingforittho   thank you   maybe he's just a cross dresser like in the movie psycho.  	8
 Doesn't the article's author have a point? After all, Clark did run for a time as a Democratic presidential candidate, and was even backed by Michael Moore.  I guess the country dodged a bullet on that one, huh?   Why all of the deletions?   I expected that the US would wait at least a few months after the agreement was done before our war-loving government continued their bullying and threats.  Guess I was wrong...   * Pay no attention to global warming! * Pay no attention to our house-of-cards economy! * Pay no attention to the gap between the rich and poor! * Pay no attention to the US fighting wars across the planet! * Pay no attention to gov't spying, racism or our eroding civil liberties! * Pay no attention to the man behind the ~~mirror~~ curtain!  Instead, pay attention to the [demagogue](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/demagogue) disrespecting the war criminal!  Edit: Above typo.    the hideously unethical things they do are "legal".  I think it's worse than that in many cases. Today the government doesn't even pretend to follow the law -- except when it does (and then brags about following the law for PR purposes).  For example, Obama expects *praise* because he admitted what everyone already knew, that the US tortured "some folks". But did he follow the law and actually prosecute the torturers? No, the political coward refuses to enforce the law and instead protects and shields publicly-admitted torturers. One could give many other examples.  If we want to be honest, we simply are no longer a country that adheres to either the Constitution or the much-heralded "rule of law".   "They tell you 'you are from al-Qaeda', and when you say 'no' they give the [electric] current to your feet...As you keep saying 'no' this goes on for two or three hours." -- German citizen Murat Kurnaz reporting on his 4 years of torture by the US in Gitmo. He was later released as innocent.    Okay, but that's most American wars since WWII,  Most?! Other than Korea (which we refuse to officially end) and the 1991 Gulf War which both had UN authorizations, I don't recall *any* US wars where we were attacked by another country since that time. Thus, except for those two exceptions, they're *all* wars of aggression.  That's the job of our military -- to attack other countries and subjugate them to our empire, and to seize markets and complete corporate conquests. And that's been the US military's job for a long, long time.   Trump is still a giant...  You'll have no argument from me there. He's literally a [demagogue](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/demagogue).   "I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class thug for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism." -- USMC Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler, winner of 2 Congressional Medals of Honor.    Imagine the scientific progress that could have been made if a year of iraq funding was given to scientists.  Scientific progress is a lower priority. Global warming threatens all of humanity!  It's estimated we will spend about $6 *trillion* on the Iraq and Afghan wars. Just think of how many jobs that would have created if we instead had spent that money on reworking our energy sector away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy...  But no, our country is addicted to war.   It's not about how much, it's about *who* *benefits* and what new markets on earth wars gains the US empire.   "I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class thug for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism." -- USMC Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler, winner of 2 Congressional Medals of Honor.         What a bogus false choice -- ISIS or the US-backed dictator.  Egyptians voted in a democratic government until the US-backed/armed/trained/funded Egyptian military overthrew it in a coup d'etat and followed the coup up with murdering hundreds of supporters of the elected government -- all with the Obama administration supplying the Egyptian military with weapons and cash the whole time.  Did we learn *nothing* from our overthrowing the democratic Iranian government in 1953?!  There are *many* valid reasons why the people of the world [see the US as the #1 threat to world peace](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/02/greatest-threat-world-peace-country_n_4531824.html).      If Bernie's point is only that if police murder and/or harass/arrest an equivalent number of white people to balance out the racial equation, he's missing the point.  We need *radical* solutions to the problem of our eroding civil liberties, and the nationwide epidemic of police brutality and murders.   "A policeman's job is only easy in a police state." -- Orson Welles.   Don't worry, corporate food labs are working hard to create some tasty flavors.  Soon we'll be eating used cardboard and will be raving about how good it tastes! Ain't technology inherently wonderful?!   That's one of the few smart things Trump did.  Have we forgotten that the entire US war on Vietnam was an immoral war of aggression based on cold, calculated lies?   When are we going to get over this definition of "terrorism".  Terrorism is simply the lowest form of warfare, slightly above economic warfare and below guerrilla warfare. Many admirable movements over history have first started out with terrorism to push toward their objectives.  Today the US and western corporate mass media has us indoctrinated that all terrorism is a form of evil, all while ignoring terrorism that the US/west uses.  I'm sure the Kurds and every other group that uses "terrorism" would *love* to wage war using M-1 tanks and bombing their enemies with F-16s, cruise missiles and drones. But they don't have those weapons, so they use what they have.  As the old saying goes, "War is just terrorism but with a bigger budget."   When the location of your chosen profession means you live in a sewer of corruption, it should not be surprising that you sometimes act like a rat.  Sanders was a much more admirable politician when he was in Vermont.   Does anyone know where these winning students came from?  Are they from some public school with a great math program? From a private school? An "all star team" of young geniuses from above-average-income families who put a huge emphasis on math?  While this is "nice," the answer to the above makes all the difference in the world.   "Raising test scores through such test preparation is like claiming you have raised the temperature of the room when all you have done is light a match under the thermometer." -- Stephen Krashen      Isn't that true of when candidates talk about *anything?*  The corporate mass media doesn't analyze the "election" focusing on charisma, soundbites and personality, and the horse race of who is raising the most money for nothing.   "All the props of a democracy remain intact - elections, legislatures, media - but they predominantly function at the service of the oligarchy."  Richard Wolff   But unfortunately, *both* of their views of the future mean more American militarism, wars, trampling of civil liberties, surveillance/police-state and pro-corporate policies and general capitalist corruption.  Ask yourself this: Will *either* of these candidates actually do anything to end the American empire and our oligarchical rule?    So, if these people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they are disloyal to the United States, as a matter of principle fine. It's their right and it's our right and obligation to segregate them from the normal community for the duration of the conflict.  And the "duration" of the so-called "war on terror" is forever, right?  Don't worry, it'll be some time before this happens. Clark, the nutcase who risked WWIII over his disobeyed 1990s order at Pristina airport in the former Yugoslavia, is simply "floating" the idea to test public reaction.  Just like the US military and police are "only" practicing this in Texas today.  We don't have to *really* worry until more talking heads start advocating this idea, or the US house-of-cards economy collapses. Right?    See I know that is bullshit   A simple Wikipedia search [about McCain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain#Formative_years_and_education) says, "John McCain was born on August 29, 1936, at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone, [to naval officer John S. McCain Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_S._McCain_Jr.) (19111981) and..."  So who is [John S. McCain Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_S._McCain_Jr.)? Wikipedia says about McCain Jr., "His father, John S. McCain, Sr., was also an admiral in the Navy and a naval aviator, and the two were the first father-son pair to achieve four-star rank.[1] His son, John S. McCain III, is a former naval aviator who was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam..."  Thus, not only is John McCain the son of an Admiral, he comes from a line of Admirals, born with a silver spoon in his mouth, a true [fortunate son](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbNnvPBokNs) who unfortunately was shot down over North Vietnam during the US' immoral war on that poor country.  Who says we don't have royalty in the US?   I'll ignore the article's far-right rant about "Masonic Jewish central bankers" and will just point out the facts:  We in the US have tens of thousands of nuclear weapons and ~1000 foreign military bases garrisoning most of the planet. Plus we've rigged the world's economy to force the world to accept the increasingly worthless US dollars that we endlessly print. We are an empire.  Greece doesn't enjoy any of these advantages.   "I hate all forms of imperialism, and I consider the US brand to be the most loathsome and contemptible." -- Nelson Mandela.    the State Department today warned that it would be a provocation to send the Israeli military into the West Bank Palestinian town of Susya and bulldoze it to the ground, despite an Israeli High Court ruling approving that action.  The US government often bleats out these faux criticisms or warnings about blatantly illegal Israeli actions.  We see this every time Israel announces a new land theft and new housing settlement.  It's nothing more than moralistic PR propaganda by the US. Israel will ignore the US, and the US knows that Israel will not take the US seriously -- this is raw political theater.   "If you are a young Muslim American and head off to the Middle East for a spell in a fundamentalist 'madrassa,' or religious school, Homeland Security will probably greet you at the airport when you return. But if you are an American Jew and you join hundreds of teenagers from Europe and Mexico for an eight-week training course run by the Israel Defense Forces, you can post your picture wearing an Israeli army uniform and holding an automatic weapon on MySpace." -- Journalist Chris Hedges.   Like the US, laws and democracy don't really matter in the UK.  Capitalists and the national security state have completely taken over the government.   "As demonstrated in Russia and numerous other countries, when faced with a choice between democracy without capitalism or capitalism without democracy, Western elites unhesitatingly embrace the latter." -- Michael Parenti   One can demand *proof* about many things in history.  Where is the *proof* that the Nazis burned down the German Reichstag? Where is the *proof* that the US rigged the Gulf of Tonkin incident to start the Vietnam War? Where is the *proof* that Ronnie Reagan lied about the Iran-Contra Scandal or the invasion of Grenada?  In operations of political and intelligence skulduggery, professional intelligence agencies very, very rarely leave smoking guns lying around -- typically one has to come to conclusions on circumstantial evidence, histories of the various actors, constantly asking [cui bono](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cui+bono) and operating on raw common sense.   As a former professor, take my word for it: Almost any city that is a "college town" (i.e. where the city relies on college students and the students make up a significant part of the city population), will have reasonable police. (Remember, local police have lots of discretion when it comes to enforcing laws.)  The economics of the college/university and the flow of money will demand that.  Don't get me wrong, if you're an ass or if you're in an extreme situation, you'll be busted. But if you're "normal" a blind eye will be turned and lots of things will be ignored no matter what the state laws are. Additionally, even in situations where police are involved, the college/university has the ability to sweep many things under the rug and to make them disappear -- and they frequently do.  With that said, having been to Keene, NH and KSC many times, believe me: It's a college town. :)    wait, we're citing roosevelt now? lol ok. i mistook this for /r/socialism.  Yes, I thought FDR's definition of fascism was particularly apropos.  But if you have some sort of knee-jerk, mindless reaction against anyone that does not totally and completely agree with your own particular view of society, a reaction that requires ignoring anything that they say no matter how accurate or informed their thoughts might be, then I apologize for insulting your close-minded sensibilities.    "Democracy is the road to socialism." -- Karl Marx    Is it possible to be a stoner in NH?  WTF?! It's easily possible to be a stoner in any of the 50 states. Doubly easy if you're going to college.  But despite the rhetoric of NH having libertarian attitudes, in many ways NH is the conservative state of New England. Seriously.  If you're looking for liberal weed laws in northern New England, look first at Maine, or VT -- both are simply superior based on that criteria.   Interesting article about a serious problem.  But with that said, they really have to do a better job with the pictures.  Multiple shots of a gorgeous girl pouring seemingly clean water out of a clean plastic jug onto her fingers is *not* the way to motivate people that this is a serious pollution problem, even if there is some green plant in some of the pics.  PR spin is clearly not these researchers' forte. (I hope honesty is.) But still, they should whip out their microscopes and give some closeup pics of these beads, trying to make them as dangerous looking as possible.  It's sad that they should do this, but we live in a capitalist society of people raised on sensationalistic infortainment who have a split-second attention span.    All he had to do was read a piece of paper and he was going home, and no one would really have held it against him.  Trump's an ignoramus dick who logically did not want to fight in the immoral Vietnam War, granted, but let's be real.  A few inconvenient truths: McCain was the son of a US Navy Admiral -- there was no way he would ever have been let go by North Vietnam. McCain was forced to make a propaganda film for the North Vietnamese, but the Pentagon still has that film classified and it is not in circulation.  And the most controversial? Some POWs claim that McCain cooperated with the North Vietnamese (not surprising; under the circumstances *many* POWs cooperated) and that he was given special privileges and even trips to town because of his father's status and his cooperation.  See [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423112346/http://www.counterpunch.org/cockburn04192008.html) or [that](http://www.counterpunch.org/2008/04/19/hero-john-mccain-as-phony-and-collaborator-what-really-happened-when-he-was-a-pow/) for more details.    Fascism never again!  Unless they're the stormtroopers in the overthrow of the legitimate government of Ukraine -- because in that case, US nationalism and western propaganda will kick in because, well, because that's what we're indoctrinated for.  And besides, the pre-coup Ukrainian government was corrupt, was friendly to Russia -- Russia! -- and we paid billions in Ukraine to fund dissidents, train young people about "democracy", and to buy friends that would protest on cue.  And isn't the word "fascist" so old-school? Today we prefer to call the fascists rightists, nationalists or even neo-liberals.   "The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic State itself. That, in its essence, is fascism - ownership of government by an individual, by a group or by any other controlling private power." -- US President Franklin D. Roosevelt.   Exactly my point, Tibet does not apply. Modern China has always included Tibet as an autonomous region. For example, before WWII the US fully recognized that Tibet was part of China.  Only *after* the Chinese communist revolution in 1949 -- after we claimed to "lose" China, an imperialist phrase suggesting China was somehow ours to lose -- and the US started arming Tibetans and backing the Dali Lama, that the west started clamoring about Tibetan independence as a Cold War divide-and-conquer strategy to break up China. (Much in the same way the US backs Uyghur Muslim separatists today.)   I don't have a source handy, but a [simple search here on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/search?q=libya+wikileaks) should turn up some interesting results.   The ruse idea is certainly correct. But [this author](http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/07/17/is-the-iran-nukes-deal-aimed-at-crushing-putin/) outlines quite a few other factors in the equation, and paints the overall US strategy.  Definitely worth reading and pondering.    no one in Washington would ever say, or even think, Our national identity is in flux, so we need an external enemy to keep it together.  Isn't that essentially what famous State Dept. strategist and US ambassador to the USSR George F. Kennan said decades before the 1997 article mentioned when Kennan said, "Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American military-industrial establishment would have to go on, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary could be invented. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy."  Okay, Kennan was focused on the economy, but it's essentially the same idea as the Soviet strategist Georgi Arbatov when he said the USSR was going to do an "evil" thing to the US -- We are going to deprive you of an enemy.  Today this idea is widespread. The US government literally has to invent enemies to keep Americans united and to stop us from focusing on our deteriorating environment, economy and our *massive* gap between the rich and poor.   "In the past our politicians offered us dreams of a better world. Now they promise to protect us from nightmares." -- [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/3755686.stm) documentary "[The Power of Nightmares](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Power+of+Nightmares)"   	37
 [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7VuGknEfQY) is her full vision from the House of the Undying.   Edit: That second paragraph might be one of my favorite new theories. Thanks for that! I couldn't think of the parallel's - with her family being up there I mean - and now it makes so much more sense. They did say some heavy clues were laden throughout season 2 for future episodes. Would be huge to see some of this come to fruition.    Great point. Last night's really put that into perspective.   TV spoilers below.   So many things seem so trivial now but conversely, a lot of the feuds between houses could impact so much in the grand scheme of things. Bolton v Baratheon will determine if we see an entire army aid in the fight against the wights. Dany will most likely learn of what is really going on beyond the wall and focus her attention there. Tyrion will have to be our champion here. Her dragons now hold a huge key to forging weapons to fight the most dangerous threat known to their world. So she better learn to tame those things. And Bran is acting as Frodo did in LOTR. A huge burden to bear, essentially alone. We all probably suspect he and his contingent will be a huge asset to the fight against the Night King and his army. Not to mention so many others. My brain hurts. So many possibilities and all we can do is sit at the mercy of D D/GRRM.   Edit: grammar      Hold on guys I gotta charge my pants.   [Link is diggin this J, right Link?](http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l7qutxYUts1qc0m6fo1_500.jpg)      This guy is correct.    fresh mint 100%   Update: we dubbed this brew the Chocolate Chip Girl Stout.    Have fun! Definitely intimidating at first but instantly more rewarding.    Was at around 63 degrees during primary fermentation. Recipe below.   http://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/13843/chocolate-mint-stout   Thanks! Link below. We turned this into a 5g batch.  http://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/13843/chocolate-mint-stout  EDIT: we added an extra 1lb of caramel to this recipe. Was around 18 pounds of grain for a 5g batch      You get the kid and they don't come with a manual. No YouTube unboxing for children either.       Its like having a kid. Not everyone plans on it but if it does happen, its pretty nice - until they shit on you.    "where have you been all of this time?!?!"   Nice shots! How far back were you?   I was 15 at my first Rush show. It was a good year.   We watched Dany go through something similar. We were not as attached to her as a character yet. Watching last nights post Wedding scene for me was almost as shocking as the Red Wedding. I'm rooting for Theon to make moves. Although chances are slim.    I just think so much of Power Windows and Caress of Steel are underrated. I love 'The Necromancer' and 'Fountain of Lamneth' so much not to mention those tracks helped birth '2112'. Geddy's bass parts on Power Windows are amazing. Namely 'The Big Money', 'Grand Designs' and 'Marathon'.   Happy birthday! What kind of kettle is that? Looks sweet.

 Fun Fact.  I just learned that Maxwell Caulfield's(Rex Manning) daughter is an extra in the movie.  She's wearing ballet shoes and is listening to music in the store when Ethan Embry is cleaning.    [Until it Sleeps, by Metallica](http://youtu.be/dFoJ3_MvOYA)   "I don't want you to give it all up  And leave your own life collecting dust  And I don't want you to feel sorry for me  You never gave us a chance to be"  Running Away by Hoobastank   I swear this place is real.  I was watching some restaurant show on travel channel or food network about destination restaurants with priceless views, and this looks identical to one of the ones they mentioned.  I don't remember much else.   Well, I didn't either until I miscarried my first pregnancy.  It never entered my mind that after that happened, seeing pregnant women would make me have debilitating depression.  I didn't want to talk about babies, I shut out my friends that were pregnant or newly parents.    I thought my severe depressing reaction would never end.  It lasted up until my successful pregnancy with my daughter.  I couldn't imagine the pain of losing twins that were carried and birthed.  But quoting the previous poster,  Whenever I see a story like this, I would be lying if I said I felt no pain.  It's just really hard sometimes to share or feel joy for others.  And I wanted them to know I thought it was admirable to show kind words, knowing how hard it can be.   It really takes something so tragic to fully understand the word *trigger*.  The fact that you are strong enough to share kind words is admirable.   He's judging the parent.     Thank you   Very good idea.  :D   Thank you xoxo   Every check made me bleed!  It freaked me out, but was reassured it was ok.      We are in the same boat! Good luck tonight.   Thank you for taking the time to tell us your story! I'm getting induced tomorrow night and I'm so scared   I'm so happy for you, congratulations!    I sent someone flowers recently.  I picked out the medium sized arrangement and by the time checkout was done it was almost $80.  All I could think of after was, if it was from Edible Arrangements, they could have at least eaten it and possibly enjoyed it more.   Four Rooms was pretty entertaining.  The scene that includes Tarantino is probably the best.    I think this point right here is the force for OP's post, unfair use of our tax dollars.  But *I know* that's not how he posed the question.   Everyone loves Johnny Cash's "God's Gonna Cut You Down."  It's originally by Elvis, called ["Run On."](http://youtu.be/anjdacZhyno)   Oh man, the tardblog was probably the funniest thing I ever read.  My favorite was "Meet Augusta, but don't touch him."  The teacher that wrote about those kids cared more for them than some of the fucked up parents.  Maybe she would have got more traffic if the site name was more tasteful.  Anyway, it is worth reading.  At least the archived older ones, I don't know about the newer teacher that had taken it over.     I'm so sorry.    Very beautiful.   You're welcome.  It feels good to feel sometimes.   My grandpa use to have that printed out, and he carried it around in his wallet.  He thought it was so beautiful, he'd read it to strangers all the time.  Glad you liked it.   Eulogy for a dog By George Vest  "Gentlemen of the jury: The best friend a man has in this world may turn against him and become his enemy. His son or daughter that he has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name, may become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has, he may lose. It flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it the most. A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our heads. The one absolutely unselfish friend that a man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him and the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog.  A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounters with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens.  If fortune drives the master forth an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him to guard against danger, to fight against his enemies, and when the last scene of all comes, and death takes the master in its embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by his graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even to death."     Interesting!  Something similar with me.  I go to Dunkin' by my house sometimes and always get a decaf iced coffee.    But whenever I go to ANY other location, they tell me that Dunkin' in general doesn't make decaf iced coffee, that they'd have to specially pour hot decaf over ice.  So I say, yea that's ok.  But it always tastes like water and not like my neighborhood location.    I'm convinced I always got full caffeine, but since I can't prove it, I didn't make a stink, I just stopped going :/   I agree.     Thank you for taking the time to write your story, you sound like a great mom xoxo   Well, I've heard different things also.  But I first heard the heartbeat at 7.5 weeks.  And I found it by myself on doppler at 10 weeks.  So, hopefully, good luck!   Yea, you really just need to test, we can't tell you anything for sure except anything is possible.   Man, I'm right there with you.   That is a movie that I enjoyed, but I can't explain what I liked about it.     Well, it would also piss people off.  I'm sure people wouldn't mind the anti-vaxxers boycotting Disney World, but Disney probably wouldn't risk losing money and alienating a stupid group of people.    Yea, I know, and the worry will never stop now, we are mothers xoxo.     I bet it would be pretty decently priced, too.  Amazon doesn't fuck around.    Congratulations!  Crazy story, but thank you for taking the time to share.   Cute baby boy.  Well, just breathe, and be positive!   The only negative thing I've heard about consuming wild game is how it is killed.  Like, shooting ducks with lead shots can make it more toxic.  But store bought is completely safe.  Bigger animals, like deer, would make the toxicity less.  But even so, the article I read said it's not good *over time.*  So having one meal, I  think you are completely fine!    Yay, so excited for you!      If it was my personal situation, and my Dr said it was ok, I'd do it.   I think wanting the baby to come a little early might be normal.  But there was someone here the other day that wanted to start pumping her breasts to induce labor early and she was only 34 weeks.  That's pretty crazy/irresponsible, to me.   You're probably going to get responses on both side of the spectrum.  People might not agree, but a lot of people choose to do this all the time.  This is you and your Dr's choice, he would know best.   I remember reading about hiccups around 30 weeks, and I was feeling really left out because I knew I never felt them.  But around 32-33 weeks I felt what was really soft rhythmic movements.  They weren't as big for me as some people explain they are, but I knew they were hiccups because of the rhythm.  You'll probably feel them soon, it is so cute.   Aw, some of those are great.     I'm not worried, I feel movement throughout the day.  Just wondering how similar our experiences are.    She will stir a little in the a.m. when I wake up, then a little more when I drink or eat something.  Then it's very small subtle movements until I lay down at night.  The evening is usually when I feel some hiccups, then some stretching and kicking.  That's about it.   Omg.  I'm just under 35 weeks.  I was just thinking how in the past week or so I've had no energy at all, and I could fall asleep at the drop of a hat.  Something is definitely changing in our bodies.     I used to think [this scene](http://youtu.be/9ZDUlaF1sKQ) was cool cause of the smoke.  Now that I watch it again, there isn't much smoke.   And The Neverending Story :(   Seven.  I feel like if I would have seen it when it came out, it probably would have blown me away.  But with movies like Saw, with the similar shock factor, and extreme unpredictability, this movie was just... ok.   Yay!   Yea I was just wondering, I live in Vegas, just bored.   Where at   What kind of music?  Do you play live shows?   At your point in pregnancy, it's not impossible to feel baby, but since it is so small and it's just floating around in there, the odds of it being consistent and easy to physically trigger is rare.  It could be facing inward, which you wouldn't feel much.  But it is getting bigger, in the span of days, it will change the possibility of feeling baby.    But drinking ice cold soda or juice works for me.  They say that they can feel temperature, and the sugar gets to them pretty quick.  So try that!  And the prodding lol   Whoaaaa, trippy.    A doctor wouldn't let it happen.  Not at all.  That can be said with certainty.   Are we talking about a certain baby in question? Or is this a hypothetical?  Because if a big-ass baby was born on January 15th, weighing 15 lbs+, with a calcified/deteriorated placenta, via cesarean this could be a 1 in 100,000 possibility that gestation time was 46 weeks.  But just know that it is not normal, or common, and doctors wouldn't let it go passed 42 weeks.  The chances of it being  stillborn are through the roof.   This isn't possible at all, conception would have had to have been mid to late April.   Edit:  Even the farthest stretch, saying implantation took the maximum amount of time, and baby went passed full term, that would still put you conceiving at the earliest, end of March/beginning  of April.   So is the [Heaven's Gate](http://heavensgate.com/) website   It's my 30th too, happy shared birthday!   Hear the resentment in ["How Come"](http://youtu.be/lEijtE0brdQ)   I came in here with no real advice, but after seeing the comment about noise, I have to second it.  I was at the movies the other night, and she was freaking out in my stomach because of all the loud noises.     Holy shit... that was great.    When I first heard that song, it took my breath away I liked the lyrics so much.    I know, it's so great.     I know, I think every lyric in that song is so beautiful.    The guys just asking to hear a song that he use to know well when he was young.   Ok, I definitely was. Thank you.    Very pretty angel!   Yes.   [Well, yea](http://www.imgur.com/9QJAKdb.gif)   My mom knows a lot about insurance companies and said you should dispute it, sometimes the providers in the network will help absorb the cost.  Not sure what that means.     No, a bunch of people are complimenting OP's dog, and all OP is saying is that they also have a beagle.  That comment just screams karma-whore to me.   [Stop. This isn't your dog.](http://karmadecay.com/results/u4559728)   Proud of you!    Oh god, don't tell me.  I'm holding off on watching new episodes until I catch up on netflix.     Like other people said, morning pee is ideal.  Are your periods super regular and predictable?    I like that one better too.  And it's cheaper.   I'm so sorry :(    I have no experience with this.  I have had a loss, but much earlier.  You need to be strong, and know that it was no fault of yours.  Telling the family will be very hard.  I hope you get answers.  I'll be thinking of you,  xoxo.    I'm just wondering how normal it is to only feel movement that low.  I usually feel her everywhere.  Today she jabs here and there and it can be painful.  This is possibly just a very naive late pregnancy post, lol.  But whenever I feel a pain, I just like to hear from others, :).   I just watched one called "Breastmilk" and it was really odd, lol.  Not really biased one way or another, just showed some women's struggles with feeding.   Ugh, I know. I'd probably be the same way lol.   This is so sweet.  I don't have any suggestions, just wanted to say you're a good friend xoxo   Aw man, that is some pretty substantial damage too.     I agree with what you're saying for other instances, but his mouth was close enough to the fire, long enough, so that he did feel a decent amount of heat that probably hurt a little.    Those pictures made me smile lol   The 3D/4D is very similar to HD, HD to me just feels the same with a brighter, slightly more clear look.  The only reason I passed on HD was because of the cost, my cost is similar to the prices you listed.  But, Google the differences, and if it seems worth it to you, you should go for it.  I would have if I had the extra money :)   Very sweet.  Saw this the other day, love it.   No, just half of one. The other half would have really missed you.   Ace Ventura: When Nature calls!   The music was so intense it gave me anxiety, lol.  But that was great!   Whoa, I haven't heard of this movie mentioned since it was probably released.  It did have some interesting and dark themes, from what I can remember.     Is it accompanied by any other symptoms?  It's not necessarily bad, a lot is going on in there, a lot of growing.  Keep an eye on any change in discharge color.   Yay!  Hope all is well xoxo   Too Many Cooks   Yes, exactly.   I initially read your comment as you were *overwhelmed*.  No, underwhelming is a great way to describe the movie, I agree completely.  Maybe if I would have first seen in the 90's when it came out, I would have thought a little more highly of it.   Overwhelming isn't how I'd describe it.  I'd love to hear more of your opinion about it.  Out of all the mind-blowing, twisted-ending movies in this thread, this movie doesn't leave my head spinning.  Although, I do think it's a great movie.  Edit: Misread his comment, thought he put *overwhelmed*, instead of underwhelmed.   I hear such conflicting things.  People tell me all the time it is cheaper to book directly from the carrier.  Then someone on reddit a long time ago, said something about turning off cookies on your browser and using an Expedia-type website for cheapest rates; Not sure what that does, but I guess refreshing on the same results page would up the dollar amount.    Can you clarify my confusion?  Or tell me if this is just all wrong...   Shut up, Meg.   I am so sorry for your loss, I couldn't imagine what you've been through.  Welcome back to the community, and I wish you a happy and healthy pregnancy xoxo   Just, thank you so much xoxo.   Ok, that is cool lol.    	103
 You guys are the dumbest basketball fans ever.  Mike D'Antoni was a fucking trainwreck, that honkey couldn't run McDonalds.  I read the dumbest fucking shit on this sub.  I can't believe as a Laker fan I have to read this garbage.  Just go back to the decision that was Mike D'Antoni, watch the offense he tried to employ to the chagrin of Pau Gasol, and go ahead convince anyone he was worth a damn as a coach.  GTFO you morons.  The amount of fucking praise these so called "Laker-fans" throw at redneck Mike D'Antoni and degenerate Mitch K is astounding, these guys don't have a fucking clue about Laker history.  PLEASE laker fans, let's bring back D'Antoni because he has the great run-n-gun offense....WAY better than Phil Jackson  /s.  I'll take 2015 NY-GM Phil Jackson over honky-tonk D'Antoni, moron fucked up that year for the Lakers so badly, but it's mainly Buss Family fault, they are the ones that decided on Mike.  People forget way too fucking quickly.   I communicated a lot with the Mods, and I can personally tell you that bunch was ill-fit to run a wild sub such as FPH, you can't get a bunch or narcissistic or power/control-hungry to manage a dynamic beast that was FPH.  Those mods were so full of themselves, all you had to do was press some of their buttons on the fallacies of their logic and you could see the sheer idiocy and incompetence that doomed that sub.  All it was was a game of plugging finger in ear and pretending they had a valid ounce of logic in regards to their rules.  It was fun to rib on fatties their, but again the mod's couldn't run a lemonade stand.   to the top sir   holy shit blind mitch fucking kupchak support.  are you a fucking new laker fan?     PSA:  need not watch that long   Oh, songs pre-2015? yea I have most of those on mp3, and newer stuff is mostly cloud-based now, though I do grab digital copies wherever available.  Judging artists based off albums seems so ancient.  An artist normally has a hit or 2, sometimes they have a string of them, better to grab those hits or the non-hits that you like than a whole album.  Asking for a perfect 10 album sounds like an exercise for the foolish.  Reddit music still on albums...   It's 2015, people listen to songs now, albums are pretty much irrelevant as a whole.  Artists are obligated to continue the album model when they're signed to aging record labels.  The way music works now is artists just release songs into the wild, sometime they work on an album, but that's due to contractual obligations and promotions; or just to string together a collection of good songs an artist managed to come up with in a short period of time.  Fairly dumb question for this day and age.   Maltese?  	8
 He's trying to look like Jen, so Kevin will start fucking him again.      Cute name for a Critter.    Beautiful, but he's wrong.   Everyone here has seen chaos mode used before in their lifetime.  Chaos setting is used when someone breaks into your house and you need to make a quick escape.  Movies will show someone grabbing 3 or 4 flammable aerosol cans and placing them in the microwave.   Next will hit the chaos button before fleeing the house.    What happens next is always chaotic from explosions and fires taking out your enemies.       Thats so cute    Check out that conch    I thought this was r/pics.   I feel like some movie should have a scene filmed here.     20 fucking years.  Just think that little pet was so excited to played with on Christmas only to spend the next 20 Christmases in the dark basement.       Is your mom 61?    They are just bonding.    I drive a 2001 lumina.  Ya.     Instant poop came to my mind   Edex.     ...10   Brad Pitt?   Honestly don't open it.   And save Ittttttok   I know!  We can't stop here show the rest.   Shit was getting hot!    Are you a pornstar?   The fish actually has a parasite.  The parasite worm infested the fish and now is controlling its body to swim in circles near the surface of the water.  By doing so it's hoping to become eaten by a bird and later pooped out so another fish can eat the birds poo.   Circle of life.    happy.

I'll watch a couple to see if there's a consistency on bids/$.  I will also x-shop amazon and other online retailers.    Pretty easy to figure out a fair yet reasonable price.     Edit:   Also as for selling in a lot of games or as singles it all depends.   Have a bunch of low title name games (sports games, repeats, ect) sell as a bundle.   Have big ranking titles like (Final Fantasy III, Chrono Trigger, Mario RPG).   Sell separate.   Have sequel or trilogy titles?   Sell as a set. (Donkey Kong. DK 2, DK3)   If you go eBay route, combine shipping with different auctions.    This will help your buyers and have them battle for certain games since they are committed on the shipping.     $2.00 for spidey/xmen      He probably seen some shit in his life.     Sorry homie.

    maybe he should pet it and ask it nicely !   as long as we model it on one of the more successful existing systems around the world it could be a big improvement   if you never grew out of the 90s you will love it . i didn't and i do !                                 the title is a bit overboard but i am intrigued by the book still                           how many practice rounds i wonder and how many pieces can he do like this or is it just a one-trick pony show ?   unfortunately this is nothing new and there is no easy fix except to hold currency abroad or hard assets   i love watching them squirm around what they claim is a tiny percentage of people we should not care about                                             what shall we do with a drunken sailor ?                     i'm no chicken but i'm pretty sure that's unidan   oh how quickly the tables have turned   *at the same time !*            most people who are homeless are not homeless by choice . poverty and mental illness are key drivers                i can imagine it doing that if not now then someday , but then who gets the liability for the decision if people are still injured just fewer than would have been otherwise ? could be very problematic               that is one of the big questions i think . can google choose the lesser of two evils in a bad situation ?   not bad                              **and whatever you do do not finish eating the forbidden donut*   no just disappointed   you should go to hell !                  resubmitted was not just you !      and beanie babies !   [i the man ? you the man !](https://alot2thinkabout.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/bradpitt-feels-good.gif?w=640)      ok i can fix this !   because the south   hey now we all know the pitchfork thing is fake just like jesus being a brown person instead of a blond white bearded guy !      sell one soul and get twice as much on your second trade-in !   pretty sure it is the whole canopy as shown in the later images and not the one module . rooftops would be a great application as well as the exterior walls of buildings for sun and shade modulation .      ~~lots of possibilities including self-sufficient and off-grid architecture as well as self-regulating building climates and shading systems . sort of like growing crops, simple materials can produce compelling outputs organically .~~  so i read that wrong ! biological systems require a lot of upkeep and retrofitting such systems to existing buildings would be costly and take a long time to pay off . also what /u/finalfate said [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/35k0tx/unveiled_in_milan_the_worlds_first_biodigital/cr5762l)            upside down one no less !         you nailed it                           see more in /r/unexpected !                           this fly can do two chicks at the same time !   nature : scarier than fiction                                    . . .         tax breaks, bailouts, the list is long and all aside from the fact they do not pay for the environmental damage they cause  http://priceofoil.org/fossil-fuel-subsidies/   \#TIL !   jesus herpes christ !   and what if they find a tiny smudge next to a larger pile and test the smudge ? seems like a lot of potential problems   or focus more on alternatives and stop subsidizing oil   it seems likely . hard to picture they would just stand down       it seems like there could still be a breakthrough that lets us travel farther and faster than we currently think possible   seems really complicated but also fun ?                     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant   just far far cooler than its cousins !                             	161
 pls. let my theory be true! or not so it makes it more thrilling!xD gonna read the final.  	1
 Just searched Google and nothing. All I found was pages calling her rocking girl.   -27 years old  -St. Louis, MO born   raised  -Out of work Chef  -Never been to a race in person but Daytona is on the bucket list.   Can you take them back please??? If you ask a majority of people here in St. Louis we want to help them pack.   No, I won them on listia which is basically the free version of eBay since all you do is spend credits and no cash is involved. I also only do the auctions that offer free US shipping so like it says everything was completely free.   STRRRRRRIKE!   I've received the in half envelopes inside of an envelope, in penny sleeves or top loaders in the envelope, top loader between a section of manila folder in an dnvelope, and in a top loader in a heavily tapped up USPS priority mail envelope.      And this shit right here is fairness??? This shit is lawlessness to a T no matter which way you twist it or whatever direction your finger points. Yet since it was a cop I bet you'll say oh it was justified. Well Thug Brown's shooting was justified too.   The library was privately started hence why during the initial protest they were asking for donations to keep it open.   No the railroad tracks are on S. Florissant separating Florissant, MO from Ferguson, MO. Only thing seperating S. Florissant from W. Florissant is residential streets.   Ok let's see here. Ferguson is split into two sections S. Florissant which is mostly white and W. Florissant which is mostly black. It has been that way for yeeeeeeeeears. Well when everything happened W. Florissant came to S. Florissant blocking traffic and terrorizing those neighborhoods.   In the past 10 years S. Florissant has rebuilt itself with a library, brewery, and what not. Where as W. Florissant has stayed a Section 8 ghetto pretty much. So in reality there are two separate Fergusons .   Who knows. They tried justifying it calling it a celebration that the chief was resigning but they're pissed because they mayor said he isn't going anyplace.   I will when the whiney ass hoodrats do. Living a town over from Ferguson all my life there's a hell of a lot more wrong with that town than the city government.   He might want to double that amount.   Time to stop calling them protestors and start calling them Terrorist since they fit the definition to a T.   Well after the shit last night it looks like they chose anarchy.   Whole department should walk out and let them police themselves. I mean they don't trust the department yo begin with.   Was just about to post his pic.   As a lifelong Cardinals fan I'm really loving this break.   After the 5th look I've came to the conclusion that it looks gaulded as fuck.   Ditto   Same   Nice looking piece and great place.   You're new to the internet ain't ya?   Note to self: Go on a train ride.   Hence the sorta. They're still triangle but not the ones from years ago.   ^That reminds me of this:  http://youtu.be/XC2VGUVvvAg   On Monday      There's a recycle plant in Hazelwood also: http://www.republicservices.com   Yeah you'll get used to it eventually.   $5 on no.   Ok can't really justify after thinking about it but what do you say to something like that?   Yeah that should be lung actually.   Was just about to post that. Now I'm not sure if I should be sad I missed it or relieved.   Good place.   Kind of a weird feeling when you watch the news and realize you heard the aftermath of a medical helicopter crash last night on the scanner. Not long after this either the dispatcher or another pilot yelled ALL ARCH CREWS STAND DOWN. Prayers going up for the pilots friends   family.   Sadly more than likely yes, and I wonder if he'll take 5 for it.   The socks are a nice touch.   Well just got off the phone with AT T and they'd coming out Friday to install a new modem which I could do myself, but anyway it's $41 a month for 45Mbps. Way better than what we were paying $65 for.   Went to Arby's one time and was told they were out of Roast Beef. Brother went to Taco Bell one night I say 14-15 years ago and got handed a whopper out the window.   Blue   Charter digital and that won't do because my Grandma pays her bills at the beginning of the month and I pay mine in the middle. Plus she hates changes to her bill so she would flip shit with that.   That's what we tried to do and they wouldn't do it.   Needing fast and stable though.   Not needing two separate internet lines. Needing 2 separate bilks. 1 for TV and 1 for internet.   Shopping for internet since my AT T bill increased. Also checked charter but they can't do separate bills for a household with an already existing Charter account.   Not sure my voice can get any lower. lol   Mine went up $10. So looking to change service. Still have the landline though.   We're like a Jerry Springer type family but still a family none the less. (No, momma I loves her and I WILL marry her. I don't care if we are cousins.) :-D   Nice.    Probably already asked but TL;DR. What's going to happen to the gift exchanges?   Looking at that it was like an in memory thing even though she's still alive. I seriously and sincerely hope she gets her life back together one of these days.   Been looking at that churro one. If it's as good as the real thing I might end up buying it in bulk. lol   Pretty much sounds like what I'm looking for. Thanks   Will do and thanks.   Love pistachio-almond ice cream so I've been searching around for a similar flavored liquid and coming up short. Any help would be greatly appreciated.   Trust me on this when I say 80% of the time it's not but that other 20% oh yeah.   Was supposed to have a rainy weekend all weekend, but they're now calling for round 3 of Snow   Ice. St. Louis weather for ya.   IMO if I have to sign a release form to buy a mod it'd say to me that the shop doesn't really have confidence in what they're selling. Yes, I know in the business world it's saving your ass but in the consumer world it raises an eyebrow.   Please tell me they got bashed in the comments.         They had an art show with them at first night and I believe they were auctioned off afterwards.   CoCo Puffz 3mg Thanks   Sounds like a headline from The Onion but sadly it's not.   Somebody name an ejuice this and make it bacon flavored.   Congrats man.   With money being tight could seriously use this.   Is it ok to store eJuice in the fridge or is that a big fat no?   May God have mercy on your soul.  Seriously though if you've been around here for even a day you'd know the meer mention of them is filled with much hate.   Signed and good luck.   Congrats! That's great that it's helping you, and also great that your Dr.'s are informed enough to have no problem with it.   Welcome to the sub glad to have ya.   Very true.   Holy Shiz! Common sense would tell you though that if it's making a funny sound DON'T PUT IT NEXT TO YOUR FACE.   *looks at pic*  Apparently not.   If you use it right and not be a total dumbass with it a mechmod is just as safe as any other ecig. One again granted you're not a total dumbass.   My bank has something like this or they used to. Here I was in my late teens early 20s sitting playing Mario kart or monkey ball.   He was a great guy to have around if you needed help on here. RIP man and keep making those clouds.   Oh nice. Thanks   Where's Thunderdome at in St. Louis? Never heard of it.   Quack's Gizzard Juice 3mg   Nice to see another great review on the MVP 3.0. Have it on my wishlist to buy when I get the money.   This is awesome!    *clap clap clap clap clap*   [Bwaaah](http://gifatron.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hank_hill_scared.gif)   Entering and thanks for the code.   They need to sell this on the site.   Damn it's going to look like Christmas when all this boxes come.   Most hardware stores sell them depending on the size you need.   Good thinking and I'll bring the gunpowder and lead vape just in case.   Yay skiddies. Used to have a field day messing with them in my teens.   B but I like delicious biscuits and farts. :-( lol  Key thing here is you apologized and are learning from the mistakes.   One of those juices you try just to say you tried it.   So basically like the USDA stamp saying it's safe for consumption. (As a Chef that's basically all I have to compare it to. lol)   Exactly this. It's all about personal preference so there's no straight answer because what's right for someone else might not be right for you.   Was just in the glycerin post and kept seeing comments talking about making sure it says USP on the bottle. What does USP stand for?   Red velvet 50/50 3mg   Wish I owned an iTaste MVP 3.0 and flavor I wished existed is a pistachio almond flavor. If there is one I've yet to find it.   *starts singing One of These Things Is Not Like The Other.*   What are things you can say in vaping but not about your girlfriend/wife?   Had no clue who these two were until the accusations posted here. The only one I usually watch is Pbusardo and that's every now and then.   Was 6  and had a man and woman just casually open my front door and was about to come in until they saw me sitting in the chair. They ran off and used the excuse that they wanted to see the inside of an apartment because they was going to rent one. Mom starts yelling that the leasing office is right down the street. Cops came and didn't do shit because the couple didn't enter.   Cats because it would explain their asshole like nature.   Spanish donut 3mg 50-50 please and Thanks.   Anything over 40 hours in a work week gets you time and a half.   So...we're having hipster day this season?   She reminds me of Bobbi Starr when she first started.   Mike and the rest of the Wallace family are great people. Great to see another local(Missouri) guy in the 500, and also great for him to represent the vaping community.  	108
 I find their teas a small step above Twinings but much more expensive.   Maybe she identified as the mother of a handicapped child. She was just living to what she felt her true identity was.   Hi Ho   The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time - M. Haddon   Flowers for Algernon - D. Keyes.   Call of the Wild - J. London   Hobbit and Lord of the Rings    As others have said, it depends on what you like. I've read most of Forsyth's books and Icon is a good read. It's sort of a political thriller. I find he writes about as well as Ludlum.   I read most of Ludlum's books until he died in 2001. Now other writers are using his name. Both of those are decent WWII thrillers.   Battle Cry is the only Leon Uris book I could get in to. I found it a decent story about a group going from boot camp to war. He develops good characters.   I never liked Wouk or Follett. Their writing just doesn't flow well to me. They're kind of like reading bad translations of good books.   The book in the upper right hand corner has no plot or character development. The only decent thing about it is the detail creating the setting. ;-)   The Saudi gov is broken into 2 distinct groups. Those that deal with international policies and those that deal with domestic policies. The religious group creates the domestic laws. And yes, the Wahabbi's like the status quo. There are also other sects and they do not like how they are treated. The Saudi's rule with an iron glove. And they are extremely intolerant of other groups/sects.   Saudi Arabia has a little under 29 million people and 100 executions this year so far. Iran has almost 80 million people and executed 329 so far this year. The numbers are fairly consistent across all countries that follow Sharia law.   Good thing they're our friends or this would be a problem. Can you imagine how fast we would overthrow Maduro if Venezuela was doing this?   teleportation   Well, in Melbourne, Australia 2 pieces of toast and a container of jam was 8AUD at the restaurants off the Yara River downtown.  And it was not artisanal bread nor topped with fancy ingredients.   I love bread and carbs too much already, not to mention butter.   They're just too tannic for me. I find Yunnan teas very mild with a lot of complex flavors, almost like a good Oolong or single estate Darjeeling. At first I thought I liked all Chinese black teas. It wasn't until I started ordering online and wasted money on tea from other regions that I was able to target Yunnan specifically.   My guess is that you use a ground tea and you are seeing the smaller tea pieces which were able to get through your strainer. I have to use a screen strainer of I have a breakfast tea, Twinings Darjeeling, Prince of Wales or Orange Pekoe. My normal stainless strainer's holes are too big for a ground tea. You can also try rinsing your tea before you put it in your cup. It may wash some of the particles away.   All single estate Darjeelings I have found are green in color. They also have significantly different characteristics in flavor and brew method. Twining Darjeeling will make very dark and strong tea if it is over brewed, if I pour water directly over the leaves or if the water is at boiling temp. If I do the same thing with a Single Estate Darjeeling, I still get a decent cup of tea.   I have tried both Lingia and Steinhal single estate Darjeelings and usually have the Lingia in my tea collection. They are both very good.   I cannot get a 2nd steeping from good Darjeeling unless I add way too much leaf. But I use a 20 oz mug so I pretty much get all the life out of the tea using that much water.   I'd try different techniques with different brands. If you like a real strong tea, single estate Darjeelings may not be what you like. You may like Assam's and Ceylon tea's more. Or even more dark and strong would be a breakfast tea. Irish breakfast by Twinings is very good but extremely strong. It is even tougher on my stomach than coffee.   fortnight?  Is that what I built as a kid with pillows and blankets?  ;-p   I prefer to order when I am low. Personally I would not sign up for a regular delivery.   http://www.teagschwendner.com/US/en/Tea_Growing_Regions.TG   I think you may find this link useful.   It's just the basics though. I imagine you could find as much information about variance within the Darjeeling region itself. Or as the link from toe_nail shows, there is a lot of variance within China. I really only like Yunnan black teas. The other regions do not have the amazing subtle flavor of Yunnan black tea.   I steep every tea in its own way. Some need more tea, some more time, some more temp. It just depends on the tea.  I find Yunnan black teas very forgiving, which is one of the reasons I like them so much. If I over steep or use too much tea, it still comes out fine. If I do the same thing to a green or oolong, I have to throw it out and start over. Single estate Darjeelings are very forgiving also imo.   I really enjoy that book and find the 101 stories thought provoking and worth reading.  I used to get the Zen day calendar and not all the quotes were from Zen masters either. But they all have Zen relevance, like the Zen Flesh, Zen Bones does.  I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in Zen or Taoism.   But most Turkish toilets have a bowl of water next to the hole, not a nice bidet. That's why the left hand is considered dirty in areas that use them. The left is for wiping, the right is for eating. Offering something with your shit hand is an insult.   The idea of having to use Turkish toilets is extremely unsettling to me. I guess you are experiencing the opposite having to deal with flush toilets.   I train industrial software applications. One of the people on our team had a Biology degree. She had no training experience, no plant floor experience and had no experience in the industry.   However, she was a great trainer.   It's why I don't drink puerh tea. I just can't get past the earthy flavor.  A tea shop in Taiwan tried to change my mind and I tried several of their puerh's, but I really did not like any of them. I stuck with my oolong and black teas.   http://taiwanleaftea.com/oolong-tea/   I've been tempted several times to try their teas. They look excellent.    Bone in ribeyes are awesome. The extended bone on the tomahawk makes for nice show. It's like getting a prime rib roast and cutting it into steaks.   I disagree. I like my poultry cooked well past when it is done. With enough juice to draw on, the meat keeps getting more tender until it falls off the bone. When meat is falling off the bone in Poultry, it is way past well done, but sooo tender.   And I guess I look at slow roasting like making meat in a sous vide. I've never used one, but I've heard and read amazing things about them. That's like the ultimate in slow cooking.   I'm not sure how some define the difference between religion and philosophies. Even after majoring in Philosophy for 3 years and graduating from a Jesuit University, I struggle with it. I guess to me, religion is a subset of philosophy.   Religions bring God into the equation.   Philosophies can explain the spiritual without bringing a God into the equation, like Taoism. And Buddha is not a God and never claimed to be one. He really wasn't even like Jesus. Life is about working your way though the wheel by following the path to Nirvana. There is no God figure associated with or in Nirvana. China used Confucius to achieve the same thing a religious figurehead does. It provided a structure to follow in life and the reasons for that structure. That structure was created to provide the rules a society needs to maintain stability and to maintain the existing social structures in place.   It's sort of like asking if there was ever a civilization that did not have a government.   I don't know if they charge more, but they are labeled as each type. Our last butcher closed so now we go to a specialty market that has good meats and butcher to make specialty cuts. My favorite is the pin in porterhouse, which is the opposite end of the T-bone side. There are only a couple of those on each side though and there is barely a bone in the center so you get more meat for the price.   He's just doing what you would do to standing rib roasts which is also a tender piece of meat on its own, but even better when cooked low and slow. The flavor of slow cooked meats are incredible imo. I also love a steak cooked at 900-1000 degrees and do that a lot too. An individual prime rib steak is nice and very tasty. Take that same steak and leave it joined to the rest of the steaks and cook it, will make it taste even better imo.   Wrong. A prime rib is incredibly tender too but any good restaurant is cooking it low and slow. Low and slow is about rendering fat and connective tissue, not just to make a tough piece of meat tender.   I use a grill called a Green Egg, which is sort of like a ceramic kettle grill. It can cook at very high temps or maintain very low temps for extended periods of time. I cook 10-12lb briskets and pork shoulders regularly. I have a ceramic divider to provide indirect heating and I put a pan under the grill and over the divider with beer in it to add moisture to the heat and a bit of flavor. Cook until it's about 195 degrees or until the thermometer goes in the meat like it's butter. Sometimes that is 190 and sometimes it is 200, it just depends on the meat. You can do the same thing in your oven. Place meat on a rack in a pan with a cover and cook at 220 for hours and hours. You can make a chuck steak taste great using this method.  Cheap meat isn't cheap because it is bad. It just takes longer to make a tough piece of meat worth eating. Slow cooking an English roast is heaven for your mouth and relatively cheap.   Locally, the difference between a T-bone and a porterhouse is having the filet side. T-bones have maybe 1 or 2 oz filets. Porterhouses have 4-6 oz filets. That looks like an awesome Porterhouse roast. I've never tried or seen one of those. The closest I have seen is a 6-10 lb strip steak and of course standing rib roasts.   Or even just some Jerry   I typically work 6am to 2pm. From 2 until 4 the PF is pretty open. I have to wait for a couple machines but I just hit something else while I wait. I'm bummed they're down to 3 bikes which is what I do to start and end. I end up having to do stretches and stuff for 15 minutes while I wait for them.   And the only thing I do with free weights is an old exercise from when I was more gung ho about working out.  I use a curl bar but I extend the weight away from me instead of curling up and down. It's like a slow motion double punch with 30-60lbs.   Graduated from an Arts degree.??   I train software for a large corporation. I was the only one on my team with a Computer Science degree. We had biology majors, music majors, math majors, project management majors and one person with a degree in education. I am also the only one with experience in the manufacturing plants where we train. The others had people skills, a good handle on public speaking and the ability to learn. Figure out what your skills are and where those are needed. Help desks are a good stepping stone to a better job, as long as you work in a field you have knowledge and skills in.   There was an article about Haas using Ferrari's wind tunnel too. Other teams were complaining that Haas's wind tunnel time is giving Ferrari additional time in the wind tunnel testing their designs. It seems to infer that Haas's baseline may be fairly close to the existing Ferrari design since Ferrari is able to use their data to improve their car. If they are starting from the existing Ferrari chassis, they may come out of the gate fairly strong. Honda is using this as a learning year and they did not expect to be competitive until mid season at the earliest. We won't know until we get into next year if Honda failed miserably this year.   It reminds me of the groups hanging around in the parking lot of the liquor stores in Detroit   I've been a member for a couple years and there is no place in our area that can touch their price. Everyone else is 3 to 4x as much with less equipment. But I have headphones on while I am there so I do not hear anything that is going on around me. IMO PF is mostly for people using weight machines and cardio stuff likes bikes, stairs, etc. People that like to lift free weights may not appreciate what they offer or feel as welcome there as they would in other places.   I agree. I grew up on Lipton and Red Rose tea and compared to coffee, it was like nectar.   But I agree with your idea that people have different palates and look for different things.   I guess sort of like spicy food. My wife doesn't like any hot spices in her food. Hot spices do light me up a bit, but I love the flavor you get from a good red curry and the spice is part of that flavor. People that can't get past the spice, will never appreciate the food. She can't get past the spice to appreciate the flavor.   Cooking over flame I'd agree because of the flame up, but in a pan that is flavoring to add during cooking.   I have a Green Egg and cook my steaks at about 900 degrees and they really don't have flame problems so the extra fat doesn't bother me. It's about 3 min on one side and 2 min on the other side and rest for 5 minutes for a perfect medium rare steak. If it's a porter house, the area around the bone can still be a bit rare, but that's ok too.   That is perfect marbling imo. If your preferred steak is filets, this may not be appealing. But if your favorite steak is a rib eye, this is steak heaven.   I drink mostly black tea, but trying the spectrum of oolong tea is an incredible journey to start on   Some Yunnan gold tips are incredible. The scent is almost as good as the taste. It can have a natural honey flavor with amazing floral scents and flavors. It's so aromatic, it's tough to differentiate between smell and taste. TWG's Yunnan Gold Needle is a nice example of what I am describing. T2Tea's Grand Yunnan was similar but their most recent order was not as aromatic or floral.   The U looked like an Li to me and I was struggling to not respond with a sarcastic answer.   I can get good green tea and Darjeeling's from local tea stores. I just need to go online for Chinese and Taiwanese teas. I haven't found a great site for oolong's yet, but I use Yunnan Sourcing for my Chinese teas now. Their tea can be so fresh that you need to give it time to mellow.   edit: I've never ordered from or tried Upton teas   A zen perspective:   You see this goblet?   For me this glass is already broken. I enjoy it; I drink out of it. It holds my water admirably, sometimes even reflecting the sun in beautiful patterns. If I should tap it, it has a lovely ring to it.   But when I put this glass on the shelf and the wind knocks it over or my elbow brushes it off the table and it falls to the ground and shatters, I say, Of course.   When I understand that the glass is already broken, every moment with it is precious.   Achaan Chaah    We've had strays in our neighborhood for years. When the temps got below 0 this winter we brought the 2 females into the house. One bolted through an open door when it got warm, but the other one wants nothing to do with leaving. She's definitely not a pet yet, but she's litter trained and doesn't scratch up the furniture. She gets a little more friendly week to week.   Does being at 30k' altitude affect this number much?   LOS looks challenging in Montreal. In Detroit, I liked how you could move around the track and get different lines of sight.   I actually thought the corner you're on, looked like one of the better sections. Being on the edge you lose the short straight, but you still have 2 nice corners and part of a straight. I'd exchange my comfy seat in front of the 55" tv for your seat.   Gaiwans do not use strainers or anything to restrict the opening of the leaves. With a strainer you would pull it out when the tea was ready. In a Gaiwan, you pour the tea off the leaves when it is ready. The leaves stay in the gaiwan for the next steeping.   Asia is big on traditions and rituals. The rituals around tea can be very complex.   Western style is about getting tea in a mug to drink. Asian style makes it a ceremony to share and enjoy, and is also a ritual going back centuries that brings out all the characteristics of the tea, as lordufreeman says as well.   I make a 20oz mug so there is not usually too much life left for a 2nd steep. I pour my water and then put my strainer into the hot water. If I make a 2nd cup, i pour the hot water right over the leaves and I can usually get a decent cup if I do that. But there is absolutely nothing left for a 3rd when I make it western style, which is 80+% of the time. In my gaiwan I may get as many as 10 steeps for an aged oolong.   I can vouch for their single estate Darjeelings. I wouldn't call them inexpensive though. As Prutzle says, almost anyplace will ship to Germany. I use Yunnan Sourcing for a lot of my teas and they have both a US and international site. Some of their teas are inexpensive and quite tasty.   Yep, the more you see through the facade, the more you dislike the actions and behavior of both.   They have to do something between their reality shows. It's like Jenner. I have zero interest in reading about him/her. The media loves a show though and both Jenner and Palin make great show. Palin is treated with kid gloves by the corporate media so it allows her schtick to continue.   Something to remember though. People like Britney Spears end up selling millions of cd's and become top acts around the world when their talent is marginal. Palin is just the equivalent to some toy boy band with a top selling song. Her musically ignorant fans adore her for her incredible musical talent.   I could make upwards of 2 bucks a day. Or about what I made on my paper route.   When Bubble Yumm first came out, people would pay a quarter for a single piece. Free snack money.   It's a 10   A buddy turned me on to Tom Waits a few years back and he's now one of my favorite artists. His Beautiful Maladies album is pretty good. Nighthawks at the Diner may be his best known disc/album. He has a rough voice, but his lyrics and showmanship is outstanding.   http://imgur.com/gallery/GGPVR   That is my luggage coming back from Taiwan. I always travel with tea and buy a lot when I am in tea producing countries. I've never had them take my tea. They took my honey in New Zealand, but there was no worry about my tea.   It's not OK.   Can you share some examples of people hating you for being a straight white guy? The number of people hating on you for being a straight white guy is far less than the people hating on someone for being gay. I can't remember the last time I read about some straight white guy getting beat up or killed for being a straight white guy. And I am not sure if I have ever read about anyone not getting a house or a job for being a straight white guy. The percentage of people discriminating against straight white guys is very, very low.   Room temp is about 70, body temp is about 98. For the most part, the more dense something is, the more temp absorption you will get. Our local science museum had a similar experiment. They had carpet, wood, stone and metal plates. All were the same temp, but when you placed your hand on them, the denser items would feel colder because it was drawing more heat from your body.  	57

    You're quite serious about this repost thing eh, do you need to talk?  I'm a good listener  	2
 http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aqtest.html   I never even considered the financial aid aspect. Thanks.   lol took me a minute to get that.   Good because I'm a liar and I find that when people ask you that they typically don't want you to tell them about your problems. They just want to seem like they care.   I was feeling a bit upset and depressed about everything in my life so I decided to see if there was a sub for this and turns out there is.  My whole life I have been a bit weird and antisocial. I never understood when people were joking or when they were being serious, as you can imagine this lead to MANY problems in middle school. I'm pretty sure I have aspergers but it's just so new that I don't really think there are any advantages to getting diagnosed. Plus I'm 16 and I feel like it's too late to do anything. I did see a therapist for a couple months for anxiety (late 2014/early 2015) but ultimately it did nothing for me and I dreaded going so I stopped. Relationships are out of the question because I can never tell if a girl is interested in me or not and I'm way to awkward to come out and ask her. There have been a few girls I got close to but there have also been way more girls that "got away" than I care to share. There is a girl I'm talking to right now that I used to talk to last year. I couldn't even tell you what she wants from us (relationship/friendship). Plus I can't hold conversations over skype/text. In real life it's better because I have ADD and so I notice a lot of things that we can talk about. I'm just worried that I will never find a girl that can deal with me.  I'm an incredibly smart guy but I've done absolutely nothing with my life. I feel like if I keep going on this antisocial track I will just end up living at home in my 30s working at a local electronics store. I just don't feel like I'm living anywhere near my potential. I feel like at the end of the day, it's not who you are, it's what you've done that matters.   I just don't know what to do with myself anymore. I have a history of depression (minus the thoughts of self harm). Lately I feel it coming back. I just want to drift off somewhere that I can feel safe , loved, happy, accomplished. I have these moments that I just feel so emotionally deprived. I of course avoid them by watching netflix/gaming. Should I even try to avoid them.  And of course my parents are no help. They have been completely unapproachable my whole life. I hate my dad and I couldn't even tell you why. Everyone time I am around him I get so tense and anxious. My mom annoys me to no end. Most kids have parents that teach them about life and help them when they need it. I never had that.  Thanks for those of you that got this far, feel free to comment.  	5

 Ite thanks I'm out looking for seeds right now but I can't find the right kind   I dunno I'm not sure if I have read any of your earlier posts but this post had me thinking it was a guy    it's nice to at least sorta know what you are going to ingest.   I have been researching how to grow poppies for the last couple weeks.  I have a really large backyard that is almost forest like.  I think that would be a good place to grow?  Any input?  how much sun do the seeds need?  that might be the only issue.  thanks!   ha i was reading this assuming you were a guy until i got to the parking lot part.   I have been in for about 3 months just about to come up on my take homes and as I today (i just talked with the head of the clinic), I haven't missed a day and have had all clean UA's.  Have I relapsed since I have been in? Yes I have used H several times but been lucky enough to have it out of my system by the time they UA and it is always random which makes it a bit more scary.  I want to stop using once I start getting take home since if I do get caught I gotta start over again but it's more tempting now because I'm thinking exactly what you are thinking haha.  I don't really have any advice, maybe just try not to use?  Thats the only foolproof way but is a bit hard when you are still at the beginning of maintenence. Also if you gotta use, try to use the day you get UA afterwards or the next day very soon after you were UA'd so less of a chance to get UA'd again.   LOL too easy   Fuck dude I know soooooo many people that would fall for this   looks like you made out pretty good just remember its 325mg pure vikaden   OK at least you have a plan if shit hits the fan haha.  What do you mean by wait a few years for a new script? Is there only a certain amount of time that you can be blacklisted at a clinic?   oh okay yeah of course it is but if you have a high tolerance they really aren't worth much but I don't know go ahead and try hah   okay I don't know any better but I would just think it would be a bit safer to ask for a higher dosage.  I mean I started with just vicodin and ended up eventually smoking bth and that is something I regret but it is just way cheaper than pH arms. Plus same as you my tolerance was building. I dunno I just got cut off from a 3 year steady script of norcos for no reason so I'd assume if doctor found track marks on you it'd be no more scripts for you. I guess just be careful.   also if you are shooting, any pharm they give you probably won't touch your pain because of your high tolerance.   so why do you need a script!?!?! haha the dope you shoot should cover your pain just as well as any pharm.   how come you are iv'ing them?   ah you remind me of myself at 21-just starting to jump thru the hoops of trying to attain that first script. I am assuming you have little to no tolerance.  Most likely your gonna get 5/500s if any narcotic is scripted.  Once those don't do the trick anymore its time for more fun- trying to obtain norcos or oxy from your doc.  After a fair amount of time and a lot of work put in convincing and buttering up your doctor(s) you will hopefully have an ongoing script for a halfway decent opiate.  haha sorry I kinda went off on a tangent I don't even know if you are trying to go the route of getting an ongoing script but  yeah your gonna have to start slow and small, this shit doesn't happen overnight.   do you get opiates for your crohns? my friend was just diagnosed with it and they never spoke of giving him opiates.   ha i've had 2 doctors tell me this actually.    Some stories are good.  I just don't always like how they write the stories with a lot of bias sometimes.   yeah thats good no APAP. that is one of the worser things I think when it comes to pharms.      Yeah heroin is fairly harmless if you know how strong and how much you are using also knowing exactly whats in it. I was more talking about pharms with Tylenol and other fillers   Damn thats crazy you  have been on pain pills that long!  Have you ever just tried to somehow get off them? I can't imagine living til a somewhat good age with all the problems narcotic meds can present to your kidneys, liver, stomach and other parts of your body. Also your libido. They did that for me at least and I was starting to get worried when I was on a high dose.   Yeah I've heard several things about getting off paxil. Some say its really hard but the last psychologist I had said it is fine to just stop taking.  I kept asking her are you sure since I had never heard that.   Thanks. I would be going to a new doctor a psychiatrist.     OK well I hope you don't mind wasting money.  I couldn't feel anything after 60 .    Hi I have been taking Paxil for about 12 years now.  I think it's working out ok but the past couple years I have felt more and more anxious and have had probably 10 or so panic attacks in the last couple years.  Would I benefit from a benzo? If so what kind?  Would a doctor be more willing to prescribe me a benzo seeing that I've been on Paxil for so long?  Thanks guys!   OK cool. I never knew this- actually just heard of etizolam this week.  So if it is "basically xanax" how come you don't need an rx?  Has the FDA not found out about it yet?   LOL!!! I've seen that movie and could see someone thinking its real if they never heard of it.   You use H on that much methadone?   Oh I just saw the link. Thanks man!   Without a script? Should I pm you.   Chico?   Because I always thought they seemed a bit more relaxed about that kinda stuff and I think Tennessee is #1 in number of opiate meds prescribed in U.S.  I'm near chico.   OK I was gonna guess the South.   you can tell its a penis and a nut sack that got smashed like a pancake. tell me you see it because i do   Yeah sometimes it happens that way. What state are you in?   Yeah you gotta think in  a Murphys law type way when your in that situation but when I was I thought naw not gonna happen to me why would it?!??!  Then boom carpet pulled out under me haha. Oh and fuck tolerance too!! I tried so hard when I first got scripted norcos to keep it low.  In about 2 years I was up to like 10 a day compared to 2.     Yessir   OK well you seem to be in a good position right now.  I have had to sign those contracs too.  I also think it's a bit harder to get a script if you are younger and a male which I assume you are younger person?  also I wasn't trying to be harsh but I noticed I really didn't need my pain medicine as much as I thought after not having them.  I still have the records of being on a narcotic for several years since then I have changed insurance and my doctor and probably could find a new doctor to start prescribing me again but I am over spending all the energy and time going to do doctors and hoping they will give me my medicine back so for now I am just on methadone and actually the done has made my life a lot better since I am NOT worrying when I'm going to run out of my script and have to go to the street and buy some H or pills. the last few months were pretty expensive since I had you end up doing that a bit but now on methadone I never need to worry about running out of meds and it's free.   Oh I just saw he's giving you fucking xanax on top of a narcotic painkiller!??!! Maybe you really did get lucky and find a crooked doctor haha cause that is quite a  bit there..   Going and once a month should be a law pretty soon at least that's what my doctor told me.  We also had a great relationship for several years as I thought until she for some random reason got scared to keep prescribing what she said was the maximum amount of norcos a month .  She mentioned obamacare and the DEA getting stricter on pain meds.  all I know is about six or seven years ago it was a ton easier to get these meds.  I think most doctors are going to try and wean their patients off the narcotic drugs in the next few years.  Now I'm stuck on methadone.  Do you really need these pills? I know you will tell me that you do but you probably deep down know you could probably make it without em.   I'm not trying to call you out but I will warn you that you got to be like a cancer patient nowadays or really old and in really bad shape to get anything it really sucks.  I am in California and this seems to be how its been working now.  Good luck I never thought this would happen me.   120 10mg hydrocodones?  just a guess.  that was all me every month for 2 years straight til i got cut off!!   Oh whaaa??   OK I looked it up I think you need a script.  How are these compared to other benzos??   So I could go to a store and purchase this??   Are those etizolam an RX medicine? I have only heard of them recently.   i got darvocet so good luck   cut em up with a toenail clipper. put in coke for at least a few hours, the longer the better.   smoked some bth saturday.  I had to urine test today at methadone clinic. I should be fine right!?!?!   Of course it's in Philly.   150 a piece!?!?!. I pay 20 that's crazy.   I have only been on it for barely three months so I am honestly not sure.   I tried suboxone first before methadone and it didn't work for me.  I went back to using for a while and when things started to get out of hand I started to research methadone because like you, I was apprehensive of it.  after weeding out all the myths and rumors about methadone I decided to give it a try.  I am really glad I did because if I did not try it I would still be addicted and in a very worst place than I was before methadoneso for me it has worked out to be a better situation right now in my life then how I was living it before   Subs usually at least partially block my high for up to 3 days!!! I don't know why but thats how it is for me.  Some people can get away with like 10 hours in between though.  If I were you i'd try to wait as close to 24 hours as you can.   ha this has been posted a couple times in 1 week!!  I am not complaining tho it's a badass song.  It was in that movie Snatch I think.    Thank you!!  I really haven't had anyone personally say anything to me about it but its kind of general notion people have that aren't educated about methadone to say that it's for low lifes and junkies,etc.  I don't care either way, I never was one to care what peoples opinions were about me-especially complete strangers fuck that who cares haha   Yes I agree with you. Before I trieed methadone I tried suboxone and it didn't hold me enough so I went back to using for a bit.  I was getting worse with using more by the week so I decided to do a bit of research on methadone to get the facts about it-not the myths or rumors because beforehand I was a bit apprehensive to try methadone- I thought that it was left for hardcore junkies.  Well since I started on it it has really helped i'm really happy because I was thinking to myself if methadone doesn't work I have nothing else to fall back on so I was getting a bit scared.  luckily it worked!   Me to for the first time ever about 3 weeks ago.  I know a lot of people talk down on methadone but if it wasn't for methadone I would be saying yes.   God I really would hope not!   yeah I know!! i guess that is with no priors even.   http://www.vice.com/read/america-is-really-freaking-out-about-heroin-use-now?utm_source=vicefbus      are you driving a buick GS or skylark from the late 60s-early 70s?     I was actually going to post this over there but this sub seems to get a lot more action than other one   I will always remember this!! You will NEVER be forgiven!!!  ha I actually never saw the post you made.   Lol!! That's a way to handle it.   Before I got a methadone I used any opiate I could my hands on. The first time I tried to stop I used suboxone.  I didn't like it it didn't take the edge off enough so I went back to using again. Towards the end before I got on done I was smoking both up to a gram a day. Since being on methadone for 3 months I've only relapsed once. For me methadone is really great and does the trick.  If you ever seriously consider stopping I think methadone can really help you.   hahaha oh my god!!!   Was this in SF?? Did you test the urines temp? They do at my clinic making it even harder to give them fakes.   wow you have had way more action than me so far. also you are lucky that they give you a take home right away!!  I just want 1 freaking take home i live about 30 mins away and drive there everyday.    so I have been going to a methadone clinic everyday for about 3 months.  the worst thing about it for me is having to drive there every single day 7 days a week.  pretty soon though I will be getting take homes.  anyways I started this thread to ask you guys that have been to a clinic what is the craziest thing you have seen or heard happen at your clinic.  somebody got stabbed at mine about 2 months before I had started going to it.  also what does most of the clientele look like at your clinic?  I would say 90 percent look like they have been living a pretty hard life so far at my clinic   I also forgot to ask you if you are on any medications and what they are for.  do you plan on being on them the rest of your life?   I am using it also do you get off of are there opiate drugs but it also works fairly well for the pain that I have had and since I was cut off from my prescription and still mentally and physically addicted to opiates I needed to try methadonesince in the past I had tried suboxone and it didn't work for me   why :( haha its not that bad. i figure I am going to need to be on some kinda opiate the rest of my life for the legitimate pain that I have and methadone although not that great if you are looking for recreational value, works great for pain and lasts forever.     I'll honestly probably be on it the rest of my life.   Yep. and now i am on methadone thanks to all that.   well it looks like OP is getting them for crohns.    All I know is that day by day doctors and hospitals are tightening up on giving out opiates like they did say 8 or so years ago.  I live in California so I don't know where that state lies on being liberal about dispensing narcotics but I was told to my face by my doc of 5 years whom I had trusted that DEA is really cracking down, blah blah blah.  What really pissed me off is that I was like family with her, she was the one who got me started on pain meds in the first place too.  Vicodin 5s then slowly moved up to Norco.  All I am saying I guess is that I thought for sure I was sitting pretty and had no worries about getting my script pulled out from under me but it did happen.  Sucks because this is going to be happening more and more now as doctors become increasingly hesistant to give out opiates.   lol ok i didn't even know there was a subreddit for kratom!   ok cool. i have only been on methadone 3 months and I have really only relapsed once smoking some tar. I plan on being on it for a while but maybe when i choose to taper I will look into kratom for sure. thanks!   Hopefully. Lately they have been trying to ween people off opiates.  I'm just bitter because it happened to me right when my regular doctor turned me over to PM.   When that happened to me I got cut off from my 120 a month norco script.  I was so excited at first but in the end got jacked. Now I'm on methadone.   yeah i didn't believe it to be like bath salts but certain people who write articles seem to lump it in with bath salts and other designer type shit.  now that i'm on methadone and doing good with it now I think I'll hold off but possibly later on down the road its good to know that it is there if i'm in a pinch.   ok I'd rather not waste any money on it then.  i'm doing good in my methadone program anways.   Ah OK. So it sort of works the same as 'done does for wd's?  You think its kind of a waste possibly since I am already on da 'done??  	85
 He just doesn't even seem distracted the last couple of times I've seen him. I've known him for a long time and I might be wrong but most of the time he just seems completely normal which is making me find it really difficult to separate the depression from him. No he doesn't do housework. I do lean on him sometimes, but only for a hug and an 'it'll be ok' kind of thing. He doesn't come to me for emotional support, he doesn't go to anyone - he likes to be by himself when he isn't happy.   	1
 [Sunset Brown](http://www.orionleathercompany.com/32mm-sunset-brown-dress-work-or-casual-belt-p/32hsnstcfstdloopl3370govblk.htm)   Which one would be more versatile, Natural or Sunset Brown?   Ah, thanks for the offer but those are a little too small for me   Thanks for the info and pics, it's nice to see how they wore in and they look in good condition for 4 years in. That's definitely a huge plus for the Nike canvas if I can get them to last that long.   Okay, I'm looking for a pair of gray sneakers that will be versatile and be able to be paired with outfits for the spring/summer. I've narrowed it down to three pairs but would like an opinion which is best or if there are any other suggestions for versatile casual spring/summer sneakers. Here are the three I'm considering: [New Balance 574](http://www.amazon.com/New-Balance-Lifestyle-Sneaker-Silver/dp/B001AO20BW/ref=sr_1_1?s=shoes ie=UTF8 qid=1395191429 sr=1-1 keywords=new+balance+574) [Nike Canvas](http://www.amazon.com/Nike-CANVAS-SKATE-SHOES-MEDIUM/dp/B004W4T11Y/ref=sr_1_3?s=shoes ie=UTF8 qid=1395191503 sr=1-3 keywords=nike+canvas) [Adidas Campus II](http://www.amazon.com/adidas-Originals-Campus-Sneaker-Micinder/dp/B0021AF6QU/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8 qid=1395191544 sr=8-3 keywords=adidas+campus). Also, wondering if I can get any of them cheaper anywhere else. Thanks!   As of last night this was still a valid deal, I just bought some more    It's on the last page before you actually place your order, you can apply it and make sure it is applied before placing the order   That really sucks, I wear a size 10 so the medium's max size is my size, but I like my socks to be tight, hopefully they get some in stock for you soon   I just bought a pair of white color size medium about a half hour ago, maybe its just certain size/color combinations that are sold out.    I haven't actually worn either of these but I purchased the ninjasox just now based on this thread http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1d48s1/no_show_socksseriously/   Really good no show socks for loafers or boat shoes.         	13

 Sex is easy. I lost my virginity at 21 and was really scared about the first time,  I'd built it up to be a huge deal in my mind.  But then it happened, it was good but not the big deal if imagined. Your body knows what to do.     Ive had and lost many pets over my life.  Each loss us devastating but each animal made my life so much better, and i know i have them happy and loving lives too, that's the main thing.     I'm seeing OMG      Thank you!    Thank you! ! That looks great. I wasn't sure if anyone would be able to do anything with it.     But that's soooo boring! No one will like that status    These are amazing! So amazing! Mind blowing. Really.    later you can see the pig bite the kangaroo. pigs are vicious and kangaroos are gentle but scared easily.    my friends have pigs and kangaroos, I've seen kangaroos punch the pigs before, because they deserve it.          The moon is a satellite    Peppa pig is hilarious. Have you actually really watched it?  Quality tv show.    I also have this talent. I'm very proud of it and i wonder how i can make a career of it   Europe is west and asia is east.    If you drive to cypress court, highbury and park there you can walk up the hill to a pretty nice lookout. It seems like its a pretty quiet spot.    Aparently yes.     A knight shot my little sister in the head with an arrow and no one cared. She was dying in my arms but no one would help her.  Horrible. Brains are jerks   One of my housemates asked me if i would like to join her and her gross old man fuck buddy for some sex.   I would have needed so much therapy.    My boyfriends mum threw out my favourite mug because it had some mold. you just reminded me of that horrible, traumatic experience. RIP mug.    If they're offered help but decline it.     When my socks slip sideways.    My SO's been doing this all day.  I want to punch him in the back of the head.     Bleached underwear...    Can't face   Welcome to my life - simple plan   This is what we call a tragedy    My mum yelling at me "THE PHANTOM RABBITS ARE BACK! !"  I was so confused, partly because I couldn't remember phantom rabbits ever visiting previously.  Turns out I had misheard her and she was actually saying that the rabbits had escaped from their cage. Not so weird actually...   Asking the important questions.   I've never pressed it, but I'm pretty sure that someone else always has.     If you like animals, fauna rescue and the koala hospital might need volunteers    All of the twilight movies   Nope, they need very special around the clock care.    Ive never volunteered, but a kangaroo carer I know finds volunteers through helpx. Might be worth looking into.    Tsunamis. I don't live near the sea.    The essential baby forums may help.  There is a section for infant loss.   What a horrible thing to happen.    Nah, that's just another echidna. A baby platypus has no official name,  they aren't called puggles.   http://i.imgur.com/bvVlG2I.jpg   "Thanks. I'll email my coordinator about the non-contact day"  I think my family will think "we really should have put something else on here"    "Don't be a cunt".  It was partly my fault that he was angry though.     It's hard sometimes but you have to stop comparing yourself to others or you will go crazy.  I've been there. You can be so much happier just focusing on yourself,  your own good qualities, make your own good experiences and plan for a happy future. High school isn't forever.     It's nice.     Best way to spend it according to the cashier.    I'm with you. .. but in a different lighthouse.    First time my mum met his mum was awkward. His mum is a bit odd,  she gave my mum a gross frozen biscuit and a tiny cup of boiling tea then smiled at her without breaking eye contact.  First time mum met his dad was fine, they get along well.    My dad doesn't like the city (where SO, his parents and I live) so he hasn't met them yet.     Human judgement causes a lot of accidents but also prevents a lot.  I don't think self driving cars will be as good as people at that yet.    Like seeing another drivers facial expressions- angry, tired, sad or what have you- and knowing to drive more carefully around them.   Or driving on dirt roads and knowing that what looks like a small puddle is actually a fairly deep hole and you should swerve around it.     Told my SOs mother that I'm atheist. She just refuses to believe me and says I'm Anglican.    What about kids who caught their parents having sex? Gross.    Douglas Adams books are always highly recommended, but I'm saying this having never read them, I can't get into them.  but pretty much everyone I know loves them.     The girl who burned her hair off with a curler   Dummy   The Babadook    Fiiine.    I do that to my boyfriend... should i stop?    Leslie Nielsen.     Ross. I hate you Ross. Stupid man child    I envy kids for this.  They can dance  through the supermarket singing at the top of their lungs and no one thinks they're crazy   My sisters and I are going to watch it at marion tomorrow night. We're fully grown adult females.    I took lexapro for depression for a few years and had no negative side effects. Different people have different reactions to things but it is a helpful drug for a lot of people, even people with ADHD.    My SO wears condoms   Eat a whole block of chocolate by myself  :( )))   Nope.  They are ugly ugly things.  But I don't have eyes in my vagina so it's all good.     I have no idea.  But finding out  is now on my list of things to do in my life   Some snakes and spiders aren't venomous. Bilbys, numbats, quolls.. all the small mammals.  Female platypus...  I haven't been killed by anything yet   Both   Singing is controlled by a different part of the brain (i think right side) than speaking (left) .  Some people with brain damage to the part of their brain that controls speech can still sing even if they can no longer speak.    get medicated. You don't have to be on them for ever,  just long enough to get your life back on track.  They are amazing,  i think medications saved my life.     Some medications are over prescribed but depression is a serious life threatening illness that needs treating       Neighbours wall, cloudy sky. So dreary. http://imgur.com/02nn4Bz   Second this.  Dalmatians are wonderful, intelligent and loving.  I miss mine every day.    I didn't know a fish could look so sad and defeated. You did amazing!!!   Get a good hair cut and keep it styled nicely.  Wash your face daily and moisturise.  Eat well,  drink plenty of water.  Dress well.     All of earth's resources are finite. We can't make the problem of waste go away like that,  we need to recycle everything. Or we will eventually run out of stuff.    If it's head was destroyed enough it would.  Otherwise it would probably slowly die from other injuries. Snakes don't die instantly from bodily trauma.      Maybe try something like "you would look great with this hairstyle" and show done examples.    Men are meant to have beards.    Explain   I would assume he was joking and laugh.     Ridiculous!  I bet you cry at funerals and stuff too...    thanks, I don't really buy into conspiracy theories, but it looks interesting and I'll have to read it when I have more time.    Tl:dr what's their argument?    Chapter 26: yeah, 's'alright   Theyre are koala crossing signs but I've never seen a koala in my suburb. Disappoint   I once stupidly thought i would epilate my lady area.  Terrible terrible terrible idea.    Everything was pulled in. Blood and pain. So much blood.  So much pain.  So much.    I almost called my sister to help me,  I was imagining having to go to hospital and have the rpilator surgically removed. But I would have died from embarrassment. So I got scissors and cut away all the hair that i could then yanked the epilator and the remaining hairs + some skin off. SUCCESS!   never ever epilate down there.     This guy.  Its his job.    I don't really have a particular dream.  But I'd probably take the risk.  life is risky   Yous      Minor stresses, just turned 26, feeling old,  had cake.   Been ok.   Thanks for asking. How are you?    Find a nice animal sanctuary to take me in,  preferably one with llama friends for me   What kind of thing?  Its 50-50 for me right now.     Or mine. Its my birthday and i wants it.    You're gorgeous.  Your mum is crazy   Kangaroos, they're beautiful and affectionate but even if you hand raise one from a tiny pinky it will still be wild.    https://youtu.be/3dWw9GLcOeA   [Con]( http://imgur.com/gallery/YleTk) Sadly happens far too frequently    They've stopped babies from starving to death for all of their existence.    My grandmother was talking about an old long dead relative of hers and said "I think she was what you call a poofter these days."  She was very fond of this relative and was saying nice things about her, just mentioned that she always had short hair and lived with another lady.    We need manual control of our breathing so we don't drown if hold our heads underwater. But we also need it automatically done for us so we don't stop breathing in our sleep.  I guess if you're thinking about breathing your brain hands over control just in case your in a swimming pool or something    I haven't bought any for a while (2 years) but i think it was around $35/ L when I did.  That's a crazy difference. So much money.   Arnold Schwarzenegger is known as Uncle Schwazzy in my family. My little sister had a dream that he was our uncle and we called him that. ..so we do...a good 15 years later.

 I frequent 2M / 70cm. I have a few VHF/UHF repeaters in my area, including one thats linked to the WINSYSTEM. That is linked via repeaters,  IRLP, and all-star (i think allstar, but I could be wrong) to stations around the globe.. The friday night insomniac net usually has ~140 check-ins every week.        Also, I travel for work a lot, so I'm in Sheboygan right now, and got on the local clubs 2M repeater, and even joined in on a couple 'nets!        That said, I'll agree with the others.. Hold on to your HF rig, and pick up a cheapo Baofeng. Add a $10 Nagoya 701, or 771 whip antenna, and you'll be pretty surprised how far $50 can go :)    I'll bet it makes a curiously strong signal.        ...Ill show myself out.. :-D    Very cool article. Thanks for sharing! Its such an iconic tone, and I've always been kinda curious as to how it was done. Had no idea it was all computer generated audio!        ...TIL! :-)   I had a hard time figuring out ramps *inside* the pool. What I settled on (and its hard to see in the picture) is the water is filled up to overflowing, so if the d'lings swim up to the edge, they can just stand on the rim, then flop out. :-) I don't think they have the ramp thing all figured out yet, lol.    Funnily enough, I think the d'lings are getting pretty used to me working around in the backyard, so.. perhaps? Regardless, I think its cool for however long it lasts. Maybe, if they hang long enough, they might 'imprint' well enough so as I may get visitors to my backyard every year?  Mama, however greets me with fear, and suspect.

But I'm guessing theyre like "Free food, fresh water, WTH, lets stay!"    Been a hoot to watch these guys.  The d'lings love their little "pool" and go back and forth between the food I set out, and the pool, creating a little water trail on the concrete. So far, they love Bananas, Blueberries, Chia seed (soaked in water) lettuce.. Mama seems to stick with the birdsees, and lettuce usually.         13 babies, and one mama.. Heh..

It is going to get worse before it gets better.      In a DC solenoid you have inductance which will limit current rise (along with coil resistance) until the magnetic field has built up.  After that the current is determined by the coil resistance.  The initial current is zero.         Solenoid is an inductive device.  There is no inrush current.                                                            Because blam, blam, blam...

 Shouldn't be necessary to look past the graphics. Team ICO has consistently produced some of the most beautiful games on Sony systems. I doubt this game will be any different.   Likewise, people shouldn't dismiss things out of hand when they completely lack context about what they're seeing. Does the actual gameplay in this look incredible, at face value? No, not really. Is it really exciting and full of promise if you are familiar with the structure of previous games from this studio? Absolutely.  At the end of the day, it's an exploration/puzzle game, and short demos of gameplay in a puzzle game are rarely exciting (Portal is the only exception I can think of). As for the graphics, I was surprised how good it looks, having first read so many comments about "PS3-level visuals." It's crisp, running at a high frame-rate, and generally looks very solid. Considering development started on it 10 years ago and it's being adapted to the PS4, it's better than I expected. It looks sort of timeless and very atmospheric, like other games from the company, and that's more than enough to set it apart from the pack.     Thanks for this. I don't understand all the complaints about the visuals. It looks great to me.   Witcher 3 looks fantastic, but the hair is silly as hell.    Nope.         I'm skipping the SOTW flair for this one. During E3 week, it's unlikely anyone would consider this the top story. But, I think it's a tipping point for Kickstarter.      I thought ZombiU was really enjoyable. Sorry to see so many people disagree.   I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that neither Christian nor Jeff would enjoy having their hobby dictated by committee. I want to play the games I want to play, and they're probably the same. They just also talk about it on the internet.   Well, to be fair, the main story in Witcher can be sidelined to a large degree, too. There is so much to do around the edges. I've played for between 10-15 hours, at least, and I've not done much with the main narrative. Having said that, it's true that W3 doesn't feel like quite as big a sandbox as Skyrim.  As for the general scaling discussion, I greatly prefer games that don't scale with your character. Part of that is because I enjoy running into a challenge I can't overcome, but an equally important part is the feeling of growth such games achieve. In Skyrim, no matter how powerful your character becomes, everyone else in the world just scales along with you. So, you never really feel particularly powerful. You can't just return to an earlier area and wreck house.  (Well, actually you can, but that's due to the crafting/enchantment/magic systems that Bethesda never seems to get right. At some point, you can worm your way into invincibility, but at that point the game is no longer worth playing.)  In games like Dark Souls or the Witcher, growing more powerful as a character is infinitely more enjoyable, for me, because I can go back to areas that initially gave me trouble and completely lay waste to the (now) low-level grunts. I want an experience that challenges me, thwarts me and, ultimately, rewards me. I don't want an experience that tries to just keep pace with me (and, in Bethesda's case, is destined to fall apart once I reach a certain point, anyway).    Yeah, and that's fine. Disagreement is normal. I've only read the books once, but I remember parts of the Dorne storyline being much more exciting than anything that happened on the show. The kidnapping of Myrcella, in particular. It was nail-biting. And there were much more interesting things at stake--rather than a lame "revenge/assassination" excuse, Myrcella was to be set up as the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, provoking a war with the Lannisters. I actually liked the idea of having Jaime and Bronn travel to Dorne, but the season has problems because they had nothing to do once they got there. This is further exacerbated by the fact that the showrunners devoted the lion's share of their budget to other episodes (better for those episodes, worse for Dorne). As it is, Dorne appears to be about the size of someone's back yard, and the populace numbers approximately 10-20. Lame.   As for the remainder of the storylines, the rise of the faith militant and the fall of Cersei was phenomenal in the books. Tense, exciting and full of emotion. The show speeds that plot along at such an insane pace that everyone involved looks pretty stupid (particularly Cersei), and the payoff falls flat. Arya's storyline is similarly botched, with none of the interest or intrigue of the books. And Sansa? I'd rather have her off-screen, biding her time, than serving as a stand-in for whatever rape-of-the-week the showrunners want to throw out there to generate interest.   I agree with you regarding Brienne. Her chapters in the book were difficult and slow. But, at least there was something there to chew on (and a great meet-up with Lady Stoneheart). I don't see how the show has improved matters much. They've completely sidelined her by sitting her down in one spot and then forgetting about her.    And Dany... as arduous as book-Mereen is, the conclusion of that mess was so redemptive for the character, so transformative, that I was inclined to forgive the missteps along the way. Dany fails in her rule of the city and completely loses herself in the process, and then (in a echo of book 1/season 1), is reborn through her dragons. Her future in the books is so bright, and her character seems prepped to take the world by storm--and it makes sense, because she's had a huge, redemptive arc. In the show? She's a joke as a ruler, fails every step of the way, and now she's flown off on the back of a dragon after a pretty silly and uninspired scene in the fighting pits. Her growth as a character through this same period in the books is completely ignored in the show.  I could go on and on... but as you say, we just disagree. I wanted to share a little bit more, though, since you asked.    Dorne is the easiest example that comes to mind. There, the showrunners abandoned pretty much everything on the written page in favor of... what? They created a season-long arc in Dorne out of whole cloth, and it is easily the most boring and pointless fiction ever to take place in the world of AGoT. GRRM's Dorne may have been convoluted and somewhat unsatisfying, but at least it had sparks of life here or there (and some sections that really hummed). HBO-Dorne is the best example of material created by the showrunners without a road map, and they completely messed the bed. Painfully.  Couple that with storylines that have had all the teeth pulled out of them due to the show's manic pacing (i.e., determination to get through 2 books in 10 1-hour episodes of television), and the season is a big disappointment. For me, at least.     	14

Do I feel like I should be allowed to have a gun? Yes. I'm an intelligent, responsible, law-abiding citizen who respects his country, his fellow countrymen, and all reasonable laws. Anyone who knows me well would vouch for me and undoubtedly sign off on it saying, "Yes, I know this man; he can be trusted with a firearm."  Get ready for the twist: as a general rule, I would not want most people with borderline personality disorder to have a gun.  In fact, I feel that way strongly enough that I would give up my own right to a gun just to keep everyone else with borderline personality disorder from having one.    Luke Cage, it's definitely happening  [You weren't kidding! Nice!](http://screenrant.com/luke-cage-marvel-netflix-2016-premiere-date-showrunner/)    That's a broad brush you're painting with. I have borderline personality disorder. Should I be allowed to have a gun?   I want to see the armored fedora he'll tip to Sue Storm.   Yes, because whites are so under represented in Hollywood.   Plenty of them? Really?  Let's list white comic book superheroes then black superheroes and then note the insane difference. Then let's compare sales and notoriety.  Black superheroes: Black Panther, Storm, Spawn, Black Lightning, Green Lantern (John Stewart), Static, Mr. Terrific, Cyborg, Steel, Blade, Vixen, Icon   Rocket, Hardware, Bronze Tiger, Black Spider, Luke Cage, War Machine, Falcon, Bishop, Night Thrasher, Cloak, and a few others mainstream movie goers have never heard of.  White Superheroes: Almost every other superhero is white.  So Black Panther has a movie pending, Storm is only featured alongside the X-Men, Spawn had a movie, the only Green Lantern you can expect to see is Hal, Static had a cartoon but don't hold your breath for a movie, Mr. Terrific is relatively unknown and won't get a movie, people are already bitching about Cyborg's inclusion in the Justice League movie, Steel had a shitty movie and is just a Superman knockoff anyway, Blade had the trilogy that kicked off the comic book movie boom, Vixen is getting an animated series, Icon   Rocket are relative unknowns and won't get a movie but were featured in Young Justice, Hardware is unknown and won't get a movie, Bronze Tiger   Black Spider are borderline heroes but Bronze Tiger is in the CW Version of the Suicide Squad and both might be featured in a Suicide Squad movie sequel if the first one is successful, Luke Cage might appear in a Marvel TV series, War Machine has had multiple movie appearances but it's just the Iron Man knockoff, Falcon has appeared in a limited sidekick role, Bishop was briefly in an X-Men movie, Night Thrasher and Cloak may make appearances in a Marvel TV series.   Reddit, where you're downvoted for being right.   Must be a fairly common mistake with this manufacturer; the exact same thing has happened to me. Some of the packages would be bursting with the things while others would have just one or two. I once had an empty bag fresh out of the box.    This is the real story here. That's 2-out-of-five Americans who *would not* vote for an atheist. An ideal candidate with literally every qualification necessary to have earned their vote is discounted entirely merely because they don't believe in god. That's *insane*.   That's over 129 million Americans, by the way.  Compare this to the mere 8% of Americans who would not vote for a woman. That's still laughably ignorant, but it's a hell of a lot better than 40%.   Dismissing a person merely because they hold or lack a certain belief is bigotry. Look at what they do.  Context matters, and to all the people upvoting /u/CuntSmellersLLP (ah, Reddit), you might bother to look up the definition of the word "bigotry."  bigotry  bitr/  noun  noun: bigotry; plural noun: bigotries  ***intolerance toward those who hold different opinions from oneself.***   So yeah, dismissing a person merely because they hold or lack a certain belief differently than you is, by virtue of definition, ***bigotry.***  If a man or a woman would make a great president but he or she legitimately believed in the Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny, and Santa Claus, his or her actions ought to be judged by what he or she actually *does*, not but his or her absurd beliefs.   Personally, I'd go with [SpongeKnob SquareNuts](http://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=1323174750) (NSFW obviously)   [Of course,](http://img15.deviantart.net/6678/i/2015/107/a/3/internet_explorer_mascot__inori_aizawa_by_kenpan-d7gs9xo.png) but she's not as popular as she once was.   there's a difference between having sexuality and appearing sexualized  Yes, there is; almost everyone on earth *has* sexuality, the only exception being people who claim to be asexual. We're talking about her having been sexualized from her earliest appearances in media which was in Batman: The Animated Series from which I have provided multiple examples, i.e., evidence. You're arguing against something I've already proved.   Catwoman has always been portrayed as dripping sexuality, it's part of her personality. But Harley never was, that's just not true.   Again, I've repeatedly shown that she has. The only difference is how much they were able to get away with on a prime time cartoon whose audience was mainly children. In the same way that they portrayed Catwoman and Poison Ivy on Batman: The Animated Series, they had to be suggestive and imply rather than being as overt as they can be in comics.   You honestly can't see the difference between the page you linked from 1998, and the one in the OP?  There's nothing even implied by the Deviant Artists' work. There's nothing overtly sexual about it. Her outfit is a slightly more revealing version of her original costume. All it shows is her navel, some breast cleavage, and upper thighs. She's not posed provocatively, and she has a lipstick kiss on a Joker doll due to her well-established connection to the character. There's nothing overly sexual about it. Sexy, yes, but not sexual.  The picture I linked has a horny Harley wearing lingerie, mounting a desk, begging for sex by asking Mistah J to take a ride on *his* Harley while revving herself up.  So yeah, I *can* see the difference; OP's pic is tasteful and classy whereas the cartoon I linked was brazenly filthy.   They get away with more in the comics, but her sexuality was heavily implied in the cartoon and its comic book adaptation, not only with the Joker but an attraction to Batman and a highly hinted at lesbian relationship with Ivy which started on the cartoon and was recently confirmed. And when I say [heavily implied](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111114723/3468732-1330712478-funny.jpg)...  Harley Quinn has always been portrayed a super sexual.

It's still an American news media outlet broadcasting this news story. Of course they outsource. It isn't practical for any news organization to have correspondents everywhere in the world where news is happening. The point is they aired it.

I come across a bunch of people complaining a specific McDonald's restaurant sells a low quality product low in nutritional value but high in sugars, fats, calories etc. I point out that not only is this specific McDonald's restaurant not unique, but that McDonald's restaurants in general are only part of a larger problem, i.e., fast food, junk food, how it's marketed, etc., etc., concurring that McDonald's definitely has problems, but so do all these other similar things.  Get it?  You don't have to keep telling me what the conversation is about. My point is that there's a larger issue, just like if there was a conversation about a specific line or paragraph or page in the Qur'an that is problematic, I'd mention that there are many more like it.    And I don't know why you don't get the relevance. It's a broader problem of all Abrahamic religions, their sacred texts, and how they are interpreted. It is not unique to Islam. If we're going to talk about The Qur'an, its interpretation, and its followers, we may as well apply the same conversation to all Abrahamic religions.   This discussion is about The Quran, a holy book of a major world religion, specifically an Abrahamic one. Saying, "Calvin   Hobbs is hilarious" would have been a non sequitur.   The point is that /u/kgt5003's comment that "a Muslim taking The Quran taken literally and living that way wouldn't be pretty" isn't unique to The Quran, indeed living literally by The Bible and/or The Torah would also mean horrifying things.  And what on earth is your point on making anything more valid? *What* is making *what* more valid? Did you actually think my comment intended to validate living literally by The Quran because doing so would be as good as living literally by The Bible?  Why am I even having to explain my comment to you? It wasn't complicated.   One of the few subreddits that *hasn't* seen this repeatedly.  title | points | age | /r/ | comnts :--|:--|:--|:--|:-- [Human evolution.](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/2ufagp/human_evolution/) | 1033 | 4^mos | woahdude | 47 [Human Evolution](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1ucklz/human_evolution/) | 19 | 1^yr | gifs | 3 [Evolution](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1kam8q/evolution/) | 27 | 1^yr | gifs | 6 [Human Evolution.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1ipx6n/human_evolution/) | 14 | 1^yr | gifs | 3 [Yet another take on the evolution of man.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/17z4a0/yet_another_take_on_the_evolution_of_man/) | 24 | 2^yrs | gifs | 4 [Evolution.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/16sczr/evolution/) | 28 | 2^yrs | gifs | 3 [Evolution \[gif\]](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/161udm/evolution_gif/) | 1391 | 2^yrs | woahdude | 81 [Evolution](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/t68l5/evolution/) | 206 | 3^yrs | atheism | 19 [Evolution](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/t5p2o/evolution/) | 1422 | 3^yrs | gifs | 176 [Darwinian Death](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/26s6kj/darwinian_death/) | 118 | 1^yr | gifs | 22 [Evolution of Man.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/2bptxt/evolution_of_man/) ^**B** | 55 | 11^mos | gifs | 7 [Evolution of man](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/24fnlg/evolution_of_man/) ^**B** | 33 | 1^yr | gifs | 4 [How humans will keep evolving](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/2140g7/how_humans_will_keep_evolving/) ^**B** | 18 | 1^yr | gifs | 6 [True Gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1tqekw/true_gif/) ^**B** | 311 | 1^yr | gifs | 31 [The Evolution of The Human Species](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1p90qe/the_evolution_of_the_human_species/) ^**B** | 60 | 1^yr | gifs | 6 [The evolution of man.](http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/1hcxzo/the_evolution_of_man/) ^**B** | 123 | 1^yr | oculus | 35 [Evolution of the human being.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1guv0d/evolution_of_the_human_being/) ^**B** | 1663 | 1^yr | funny | 299 [evolution of man](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1d2drp/evolution_of_man/) ^**B** | 109 | 2^yrs | gifs | 4 [I love my devices too, but lets make sure this doesnt happen.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/15n3df/i_love_my_devices_too_but_lets_make_sure_this/) ^**B** | 117 | 2^yrs | gifs | 12 [Human Evolution](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/15erut/human_evolution/) ^**B** | 134 | 2^yrs | gifs | 15 [Human Evolution](http://www.reddit.com/r/gif/comments/149s7y/human_evolution/) ^**B** | 1067 | 2^yrs | gif | 57 [Evolution of man](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/xib5m/evolution_of_man/) ^**B** | 1158 | 2^yrs | gifs | 194 [evolution of humans... the future is not so bright.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/wv1fq/evolution_of_humans_the_future_is_not_so_bright/) ^**B** | 40 | 2^yrs | gifs | 8 [The Evolution of the Human Species](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/wnhws/the_evolution_of_the_human_species/) ^**B** | 306 | 2^yrs | pics | 22 [Evolution of humanity](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ukwce/evolution_of_humanity/) ^**B** | 942 | 3^yrs | funny | 54 [Evolution](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1he6br/evolution/) ^**B** | 14 | 1^yr | funny | 3   I think the others would be rendered temporarily unconscious and she's be like regular Joy but on god mode.   Bing Bong made the greatest sacrifice possible.  I was reading the official discussion thread over at /r/movies and some people were pointing out that Bing Bong was never mentioned again and some were expecting his memory to be brought up somewhere toward the end or even in a post-credits scene.   I'm so glad they didn't.  Because as soon as you do that, there is no sacrifice. He's a figment of her imagination; he was never alive nor did he ever die. He was rattling around in her brain aimlessly and without purpose. It was in his sacrifice that he was able to make a real difference for the first time in a long time, and only greater sacrifice than giving your life for someone else's is to do so anonymously and not even be remembered for it. There was absolutely nothing in it for him at all. No fame, no glory, no memory.   When he started helping Joy   Sadness, he was doing it because they said they could help her remember him. He was doing it for selfish reasons. His last act was the most unselfish thing he could ever do, knowingly sacrificing both his existence and any memory of him ever having existed.  Anything more would have cheapened it.     Why not get a memory orb of him and show it off? He gave his life to save the girl  Because as soon as you do that, there is no sacrifice.

You nailed it. Yeah, Cars was weak, but I expected it to be weak. I had outlandish expectations for Brave, so when I saw it I was so underwhelmed I felt like I was drowning.   That battle did seem a tad long, but I think that goes back to laying the groundwork for the next installment of the DCCU. We really had to get a sense of the scope of destruction caused by these godlike beings to appreciate the human reaction to it in Batman V Superman.   Yes! The obvious agony that he went through immediately after taking a life made him instantly more relatable and human than all the "Clark Kent" narrative in the first 2/3 of the movie. The consequences and ramifications of it only make him that much more interesting and sympathetic.   Exactly. I saw those discussions break out everywhere after Man of Steel was widely-viewed and it's like people are somehow isolated from the fact that the movie got them talking and discussing about a moral issue.   Your arguments are from the perspective of a viewer of Man of Steel in our universe, not from the perspective of a Metropolis citizen in the Man of Steel universe.  All they know is aliens invaded their planet and threatened their world because Superman was there and they wanted to kill him. Then a fight breaks out and the result is like a dozen 9/11s. It was like living in Tokyo during a Godzilla fight. No one in Tokyo gives a shit if Godzilla was the "good guy" or "bad guy" in the fight; they care that their entire city was razed.  Then you'll have Lex Luthor helping to rebuild and using the distrust and fear, fueling it, adding speculation like, "What if Superman decided to take over the world? What if he decided to destroy it?"  People fear what they don't understand; Superman is beyond understanding; fear leads directly to hate. Yes, some people are going to see through all that and not blame him for the Kyptonian invasion and get that he didn't intentionally destroy half the city and was just trying to stop really horrible aliens from doing really horrible shit, and that's why there will be more than one position.  It's kind of political thriller when you think about it.   You're absolutely right, and you're citing one of my favorite writers alongside one of my favorite Superman stories to make your point.  The thing with Man of Steel though is that it was the first installment in the DC Cinematic Universe and they had the future to think about. Barring a complete and total commercial flop, Man of Steel would be the foundation for each DCCU film to follow, and that includes setting a tone. Part of it was to set itself apart from Marvel, and the success of Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy was a clear message to the brass at Warner Bros. that the audiences liked their DC Comics movies darker, more serious, and with a more grounded approach, so they weren't about to fix something that wasn't broken. They could have gone lighter with Man of Steel, but then it probably would have done a shit job of setting up Batman V Superman, and more importantly, Justice League and its spin-offs.   Unless Superman is fallible, thoughtful, philosophical, and grounded, he won't fit in when Batman shows up as his antithesis and they won't get to play with all the fun ideas of different philosophical approaches to seeking justice that the comics have played with over the decades. The trailer basically screams "Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns The Movie," and they obviously want to explore some of those ideas.   For people who really didn't like Man of Steel, hey, opinions are opinions, tastes are tastes, but I caution patience. They're going somewhere with this.    I know this probably wasn't intentional, but that perfectly describes Man of Steel.   Only the battle. Everything up until then was a pretty fascinating character study.  By the way, I agree completely on Winter Solider. That is easily one of the best superhero movies ever made and I don't think it gets enough credit.   I've seen the blades on trucks and they are quite a sight to see.   Especially if he happened to be black...   You argued my own point against yourself. Yes, every superhero has to resist the urge to act selfishly and deal with the consequences of power, but not like Superman because he's not a bright teenager bitten by a radioactive spider who can do whatever it is a spider does (like ESP, apparently). He's a god. He's is practically invincible, powerful beyond reason, and has a variety of powers at his disposal that are usually meted out one or two at a time for other heroes. Any normal person would justifiably have a god complex.   If I were Superman--I won't even lie or sugarcoat it on the internet anonymously for strangers to read it--I would take over the world and shape it as I see fit. I'd be a benevolent overlord, but an overlord I would be, and the shitty thing is, I'm not some megalomaniac asshole; I'm a regular guy. I'd do what most people would do.   Superman is interesting because he doesn't. He's above that. Injustice's who premise is pretty much, "What if something happened that made Superman do what any of us would do and impose his will on the world because he can?"    I didn't mind the whole "dark" thing. I appreciate it, it adds a level of seriousness that I wish Marvel would at least dip their toes into.   I like that the brands have separate and recognizably different approaches. I know when I see a Marvel movie it'll be a big, colorful, fun, smash-em-up explosion and punch festival with little jokes sprinkled in with paper thin plots.   I know when I see a DC movie it'll be more grounded, realistic, darker in tone, and have actual meaning and consequences to think about.   He didn't have access to The Phantom Zone when he was dealing with Zod.   The police can arrest and apprehend. Everything after that is handled by the courts and corrections. Superman doesn't have that option and, as of the end of Man of Steel, there was no place to put someone on his power level that would hold them.   He did what he did because there was no obvious, viable alternative.    it was a rule invented for more kid friendly stuff  It's actually more to do with having recurring villains. For example, Batman has been published for over 75 years and across dozens of different monthly titles, limited series, one-shots, graphic novels, etc. If Batman killed his villains, the writers would have to keep coming up new ones all the time and we wouldn't have all these classic recurring characters.  What people fail to understand is that movies don't have this problem. The Joker is probably only going to appear once per franchise, so killing him doesn't matter.   As for Man of Steel, the kill meant something. It seemed to be the only thing he could do at the time, and he'll face the consequences for it. It's going to be pivotal moment for him and he'll have decisions to make. Guys like Lex will get to make multiple appearances throughout the DC Cinematic Universe because Superman is going to have to think up better ways of handling his adversaries than execution or no one will trust him and he's too powerful a being to be both untrusted *and* left alone.   I agree with everything you wrote. "Man of Steel" was laying the groundwork for a franchise and had to establish a new Superman that was never the Christopher Reeves version nor ~~The Atom~~ Brandon Routh version nor the Lois   Clark version or the DCAU version.   You hit the nail right on the head. This was Clark Kent becoming the Man of Steel. That ending that everyone complains about is him dealing with the consequence of his godlike power, the fallout from it, exploring the psychology of an outsider who wants to do good but isn't trusted because he's just too damned powerful. It's the most realistic take on Superman ever committed to film, so yeah, he's not going to be the bright eyed blue boy scout holding an American flag in one hand and an bald eagle perched on the other while telling kids to take their vitamins.   I sometimes wish I could. I feel like I'm missing out on some audio bliss that's beyond my range of hearing.  On the other hand, a hard drive full of 128kbps MP3s doesn't take up a lot of valuable space.   Some people can, but it's a minority.   [Studies (PDF) have found that as long as you're using high-quality encoding software, music compressed to a bitrate of 128 kbps or more is "transparent"in other words, most listeners can't distinguish it from CD quality](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2007/04/are_itunes_premium_downloads_worth_it.html).    Study after study shows most people can't and I'm one of them, but I do sometimes wish I could hear whatever audio orgasms those with more sensitive ears can hear.   I've done exactly that and can't hear any difference. This exact type of blind study has been done many times from many sources with similar result each time: most people can't tell the difference, many people who *can* tell the difference have about an equal chance of favoring either 128 or 320, or there's no preference.  The number of people who can hear the difference and consistently prefer the 320 to the point where they find the difference noteworthy and important, the so-called "audiophiles," are statistically low.  That being said, if you're an audiophile, obviously it's important to you, and it's good we have options like FLAC and sophisticated audio equipment.    I don't know how it wasn't the "city of tomorrow," but if it wasn't, they totally wrecked it and maybe that's what Lex's rebuilding of Metropolis is all about.  As for him being "The Man of Yesterday," this is the only instance of him ever being called that, and part of the point of Man of Steel was to bring Superman into modern times so he doesn't seem like a dated, corny relic with Ma and Pa, apple pies cooling on window sills, truth, justice, and the American way. It's intentionally modern and as grounded in reality as something as outrageous as Superman can be.  If you didn't like that, you've got plenty of company, but the style in which the movie was done was highly intentional/purposeful.    To prevent the coffee from spilling.   Aside from the darker color scheme, I didn't see Man of Steel's Superman as being "dark" or "looking angry all the time."   The Max Martin signature.  Listen to the bridge of the song, or failing that, listen to the next-to-last chorus or breakdown. You'll notice he has the artist repeat the chorus lyrically with a slightly different melody immediately afterward. Some examples include:  Backstreet Boys - [Shape Of My Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT5msu-dap8#t=157)  Backstreet Boys - [I Want It That Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fndeDfaWCg#t=152)  Britney Spears - [Lucky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vvBAONkYwI#t=181)  Britney Spears - [Stronger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJWtLf4-WWs#t=160)  Britney Spears - [You Drive Me Crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4VK9_CfOLQ#t=141)  Britney Spears - [Oops!

Why was it so readily employed?  Bo Burnham - [Repeat Stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt9c0UeYhFc)  Max's little trick enables the artist to repeat the chorus **yet again** while keeping the song fresh in the listener's mind, much akin to the way a "breakdown" does it by taking away elements of the backing track.  /u/Oafah      I soldiered through the entire first season of Gotham; I'm sure I can handle 5-6 episodes of weak shit. I'll give it a go. Thank you.   Before anyone wastes hard drive space or has a music collection they can't put on their iPod, take a few seconds and [do this test.](http://www.noiseaddicts.com/2009/03/mp3-sound-quality-test-128-320/)  If you can't tell the difference--and most people can't--128kbps mp3s will be just fine.   I've never seen Agents of Shield so this is news so me. Good to know. Thank you.   Expecting the guy to get hit in the groin doesn't mean you have a dirty mind.    If you feel shitty having watched it, imagine how the asshole who taped if felt?   And then Phil Collins wrote a song about it.    San Antonio?   Yes, but some reposts need to be reposted. The fact that there are people seeing this for the first time means it could save someone's life.    What, if anything, could the realistic, scientific (or ever pseudo scientific) explanations for some of these be? I could fathom an explanation for the need to suck blood, aversion to sunlight, and the nocturnal thing goes with that, but what about being invited in our crossing bodies of water?   You also can't deny the Holy Spirit. There's no going back on that.    Which was four shades of gray. Effectively there was "white" (actually green because of the screen's plate), black, dark gray, gray, and light gray. Super Game Boy worked by mapping a 4-color palette to those 4 shades of gray.         #JustLinuxThings   Checkmate atheists?   Indigo is the Pluto of colors.    It's at the discretion of the theater, and when I worked at one, I don't know of anyone who ever carded anyone ever.   Actually it's an acronym ["identification document."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document)     You don't have to be 18 to see R-rated movies; it's at the discretion of the theater and most theaters allow 17+ with ID or pretty much any age with an adult. Also, carding is unlikely if you look anywhere close to the policy age because no theater wants to piss off costumers with unnecessary harassment.  Film ratings are a suggestion, not a law.  http://www.mpaa.org/film-ratings   I actually wish DC would adopt the Arkham series costume designs over Jim Lee's New 52 design for Batman.   He's a multibillionaire who owns tech and industrial companies. Realistically, he's not Robocop enough.   It continues the [](#s "Infinity Gems/Stones saga")--one of them is the sole motivation of the villain--and shows [](#s "Thanos") as a kind of continuation of his brief cameo in the [](#s "first Avengers.") It's otherwise a standalone movie.   Only that it references "The New York Incident," i.e., The Avengers movie but makes no further references. It really wouldn't matter when someone watched Daredevil as long as it's after Avengers, and even then, it's only so they get the passing references to the first Avengers movie.   I'm currently using [this one](http://i.imgur.com/27CW6yf.jpg) as my desktop wallpaper for my HDTV.   Or know about the other 7 to begin with. Unless you voluntarily surrender them, they'd logically stay in your possession.    reasonably appears necessary  i.e., not pulling a gun to stop an unarmed attacker.  Instead of arguing with me, here's the actual law from criminal defense:   retreat if possible without taking any physical action, and  use only the amount of force reasonably necessary to fend off the attacker.  http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/using-a-gun-self-defense-laws-and-consequences.htm  Worth noting some states are more relaxed about this than others, including the 32 states that have adopted "stand your ground" laws that expand traditional self defense laws and extend the castle doctrine to confrontations outside a persons home.   You might want to read that again. Nowhere does it say you get to pull out a pistol because you feel threatened. It also says you can't ban handguns or required lawful firearms in the home to be disassembled or trigger-locked.  "Self-defense"  "pull gun on anyone perceived as threat"   No, I don't. That's why I posted the original question.   The second amendment guarantees only your right to a firearm, not to brandish it over feeling threatened. Laws vary by state, but in many states, mine including, whipping out a pistol because you feel threatened will get you arrested for criminal threatening and potentially a few other charges like criminal mischief and disturbing the peace.   That's exactly my point and the meat of my question. You can legislate new gun control laws all day, but you won't even begin to address the sheer number of guns already out there and there's no possible way to recover them all. I'd argue you couldn't even confiscate a majority of them.   That still doesn't tell the government where the guns end up. There is no database telling the federal government where every gun manufactured and sold is, nor any way of knowing who does or does not own a gun and if so how many.   If people are using their guns to get out of situations that don't involve guns, are they not a bit trigger happy? When I used to carry, that pistol didn't come out without threat of deadly action that would warrant it. Consequently, it never came out, and I've been in threatening situations.  Guns aren't meant to get you out of a fist fight.   Dat finale...    defen- sive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals  That's not really a great statistic. If this is the strongest self-defense case, it means they're just as likely to be used criminally as they are in self-defense.   It's also worth noting that those self-defense occurrences are likely to be forced by having to deal with a gun-wielding threat to begin with, i.e., if bad guys didn't have guns, good guys would need guns with which to defend themselves.   It's not about how you get a better reaction; it's about logistics. How do you pay for  270 - 310 million guns? At a dollar each, we're already at hundreds of millions of guns.  As for your 99.99% figure on paper trails, where on earth are you getting that number from? [There is no mandatory gun registration in the United States.](http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/04/gun-ownership-by-the-numbers/) That's why the 270 - 310 million guns figure has a 40 million gun gap. Even under the threat of a felony charge, it is estimated that the compliance rate for gun registration in Connecticut is less than four percent.  Theres no universal gun registry, and thus not a simple way to pin down the exact number of firearms in the U.S. So again, how would you even begin to do a buyback?   Thank you to everyone responding and taking the question seriously.

Ah, Reddit...    buy them back form the citizens  How you plan on paying for 270 - 310 million guns, and how can you force anything if you don't know who has them?      The self defense claim isn't a strong one.  Gun owners committed 259 justifiable homicides compared to 8,342 criminal homicides in 2012, the most recent year data was available.  That means gun owners are 32 times more likely to kill someone without cause than to act in self-defense.

I know the roundabout so well by now when it comes to these issues because this debate rages every single time a mass shooting happens, which is far too often in this country, and while I would like to see something done and I value human life far more than I do gun rights, I have yet to get a satisfactory answer to this one question: what do you do about the guns that are already out there?  [The United States has 88.8 guns per 100 Americans.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country) That doesn't mean 88.8% of Americans are armed; rather that's how many guns there are in the United States that are owned by somebody. Let's say we went gun control crazy with waiting periods, mental health screenings, background checks, the works. Hell, let's say we banned the sale of any more guns at all making it 100% illegal to sell a firearm. [There are by various estimates anywhere from 270 million to 310 million guns in the United States.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/06/04/a-minority-of-americans-own-guns-but-just-how-many-is-unclear/) What do you do about all those?   The best suggestion I've heard is a buyback program, but that's voluntary and costly.   What's the solution? Because until we deal with the reality that the United States has an out-of-control gun fetish, any further restrictions are like saying you can't add any more grains of sand to the beach.         Scientists need to back up their opinions with research and data that survive the peer-review process.  [A Skeptical Science peer-reviewed survey](http://skepticalscience.com/97-percent-consensus-cook-et-al-2013.html) of all (over 12,000) peer-reviewed abstracts on the subject 'global climate change' and 'global warming' published between 1991 and 2011 ([Cook et al. 2013](http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/article)) found that over 97% of the papers taking a position on the subject agreed with the consensus position that humans are causing global warming.  In a second phase of the project, the scientist authors were emailed and rated over 2,000 of their own papers.  Once again, over 97% of the papers taking a position on the cause of global warming agreed that humans are causing it.  But you actually think you know better?  No offense /u/dutchguilder2, but I'll side with the climate scientists.    As of 6:20 Eastern time (US), 48 comments saying "Beeracle."  9 more misspelling the portmanteau by commenting "Beericle."  Ah, Reddit, as original as this repost.   Also does anyone ever use the mode? What a stupid way of "averaging" numbers.    It has its uses. I find it noteworthy, for example, in IMDb ratings.   For example, Pulp Fiction currently sits at an 8.9, arithmetic mean = 8.7.  Median = 9. The stat *I* find interesting is that 40.2%, nearly half of all users rated it a perfect 10.  So it's useful to me because the displayed score of 8.9 doesn't reflect just how many people consider it a perfect film.    transgender people have a "physically different brain"  Not exactly, but there *are* differences.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism#Brain_structure   There's no consensus, but there are some good theories:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism   It's hardly a fight at all. Just people going bonkers for a gimmick.   Wrong thread.   Only thing missing: wings.   My mistake.   Pretty sure all our presidents are war criminals too.   That's the original comment that started this thread. Then I said   Pretty sure all of them aren't; 31 presidents served only in peace time.   Then /u/icarus-_-sky  said:  Our current president, and every president in the last 50 years has served during peace time. Name one 5-year span that the US has not been involved in a violent conflict in that time period. No declaration of war =! peace time.  To which you replied:  and even when not engaged in direct military conflict[1] (although its tough to find many periods there when America isn't fighting someone, most of which they started themselves), those presidents are still overseeing the CIA as it deliberately undermines Govts, destabilizes nations, and carries out its terrorist attacks around the world[2] .  Even when America isn't publicly at war, its pretty much guaranteed to be killing people somewhere  Staying on topic, you seemed to be justifying the original post which started this thread and that's what I'm responding to. My point isn't "moot;" my point is on topic.     Even when America isn't publicly at war, its pretty much guaranteed to be killing people somewhere  That doesn't necessarily mean a war crime is being committed.   In this statement:   Pretty sure all our presidents are war criminals too.  What actions by every US president would constitute a war crime? This statement is so far beyond hyperbole. The fact that there is violent conflict during a presidency does not ipso facto imply guilt of war crimes. That is ludicrous.   I agree with you there, Garfield was a better Peter Parker/Spider-Man, but there's more to a movie than just being true to the character, and if that's the best thing that can be said about, that isn't good. ASM2 was silly from the opening action sequence to the very end, and Electro was a bad joke. The only reason I was able to sit through the entire movie was because I was watching it at home laughing and making fun of it with my wife.  ASM1 wasn't bad by any means; it just felt unnecessary and redundant. I didn't find it ever matching the original 1   2 in terms of excitement or awe.   Amazing 1 was alright, so far as I'm concerned, but the biggest strike against it was that it was a reboot of a very recent franchise and tread a lot of familiar ground. I found it more of a dull ride than the original Spider-Man, and the original Spider-Man may not appeal as much to a younger generation who may not be able to appreciate how groundbreaking it was.   As for ASM2, I can't understand anyone actually enjoying it aside from comedic value as in MST3K mockery of how silly/stupid it was. That being said, opinions vary, but it was the impetus of yet another Spider-Man reboot, so there's that.  You're definitely entitled to your opinion and I'm happy you shared it.   [Jewish Life in the Middle Ages](http://www.amazon.com/Jewish-Life-Middle-Israel-Abrahams/dp/1162729651) is only $9.99 on Kindle and it's quite good if you're interested.  I'll attempt to answer your question, Roth underscored the precarious existence of all peoples' lives in the Middle Ages:  "The modern reader frequently fails to realize that, generally speaking, life in the Middle Ages was not secure. For every section of the population the probabilities of meeting a violent death were high, even in times of comparative peace. Country people were continually subject to the onslaught of bandits or of lawless barons, as well as the marchings and counter marchings of armed forces.         [Even] city dwellers ... [ran] the risk of sack and wholesale murder. The whole of medieval, and a great part of modern, history is studded with instance of the sort: the devastation of Attila, the Scourge of God; the ravaging of the Vexin by William the Conqueror; the sack of a score of German cities during the Thirty Years War.         There were frequently cases when only a minority of the population survived, the vast majority being piteously massacred.   These events and their like should be borne in mind when one considers the vicissitudes of any particular racial or religious minority. The scarlet of Jewish persecution does not stand out on a ground of virginal white."

High school made me think the mark of a great writer was some genius level ability to bury symbolism throughout their writing for people clever enough to dig up.

He trained and practiced to be in peak physical condition and spent countless hours perfecting his craft. "Awesome" pretty well describes him and his talents, all of which are perfectly within "natural" and thereby scientifically explainable parameters. Anyone trying to attribute mysticism and otherworldly attributes is doing so needlessly, and it takes away from the skill, dedication, and talent of the man himself.   You're right. I copy/pasted that from the Wikipedia article I linked at the bottom, but here's a Wikipedia article on [Capital punishment in Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Judaism) which includes even your molten lead thing.     No made a "huge deal" and being corrected is how people learn.    abjectly good  That's not a thing. "Abject" is always negativeit is a modifier that means "hopeless," not "extreme." You can't have "abject good" unless you're being purposefully paradoxical, i.e., ironic.   Your point is taken and well made, but /u/djeijdowq is right so far as Jewish interpretation is concerned. The Talmud interprets the verses referring to "an eye for an eye" and similar expressions as mandating *monetary* compensation in tort cases and argues against the interpretations by Sadducees that the Bible verses refer to physical retaliation in kind, using the argument that such an interpretation would be inapplicable to blind or eyeless offenders. Since the Torah requires that penalties be universally applicable, the phrase cannot be interpreted in this manner.   Since there is no form of punishment in the Torah that calls for the maiming of an offender, there is no case that could possibly be punished by the court injuring to his eye, tooth, hand, foot, etc.  The Talmud discusses the concept of justice as measure-for-measure retribution (middah k'neged middah) in the context of divinely implemented justice. Regarding reciprocal justice by court, however, the Torah states that punishments serve to remove dangerous elements from society ("and you shall eliminate the evil from your midst") and to deter potential criminals from violating the law ("And the rest shall hear and be daunted, and they shall no longer commit anything like this evil deed in your midst"). Additionally, reciprocal justice in tort cases serves to compensate the victim (see above).  The ideal of vengeance for the sake of assuaging the distress of the victim plays no role in the Torah's conception of court justice, as victims are cautioned against even hating or bearing a grudge against those who have harmed them. The Torah makes no distinction between whether the potential object of hatred or a grudge has been brought to justice, and all people are taught to love their fellow human beings.  [Eye for an Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_for_an_eye#Talmud)   No. Despite some vague understanding of how diseases could spread, the existence of viruses and bacteria was unknown in medieval times, and the outbreak of disease could not be scientifically explained. Any sudden deterioration of health was often blamed on poisoning. Europe was hit by several waves of Black Death (often identified as bubonic plague) throughout the late Middle Ages. Crowded cities were especially hard hit by the disease, with death tolls as high as 50% of the population. In their distress, emotionally distraught survivors searched desperately for an explanation. The city-dwelling Jews of the Middle Ages, living in walled-up, segregated ghetto districts, aroused suspicion. An outbreak of plague thus became the trigger for Black Death persecutions, with hundreds of Jews burned at the stake, or rounded up in synagogues and private houses that were then set aflame. With the decline of plague in Europe, these accusations lessened, but the term "well-poisoning" remains a loaded one that continues to crop up even today among anti-Semites around the world.  Walter Laqueur writes in his book The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day:  There were no mass attacks against "Jewish poisoners" after the period of the Black Death, but the accusation became part and parcel of antisemitic dogma and language. It appeared again in early 1953 in the form of the "doctors' plot" in Stalin's last days, when hundreds of Jewish physicians in the Soviet Union were arrested and some of them killed on the charge of having caused the death of prominent Communist leaders... Similar charges were made in the 1980s and 1990s in radical Arab nationalist and Muslim fundamentalist propaganda that accused the Jews of spreading AIDS and other infectious diseases.[3]  [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_poisoning)   [Here's a lion protecting a calf.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I9X4-nhxJ4)  [If you want the longer version/full story.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrgpk8J7F_4)  [Here's one that adopted an antelope.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBlLKvfzmo)  [Here's one sparing and caring for a baby baboon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmn31bcYkn4)   My only claim is that the world is not what science says it is  What does science say the world is and how is it wrong?    there are energies that science cannot quantify in any means in accordance to popular theory  Really? Name them and tell me how science gets it wrong.  I'm not a scientist  ***GASP!!!***  I am experienced in martial arts and how the transfer of energy can heal.  Martial arts, literally combat practices, are not about healing; they are about self defense, usually by means of causing harm, injury, incapacitation, or even death to a threatening party. It is not about healing, and certainly nothing to do with magical energies. Whatever dojo you're attending that is preaching this nonsense is ripping you off.  My only point is that just because a scientist can't prove it doesn't mean it's wrong in some cases.  Science isn't about proving things. There's hypothesis, evidence, law, and theory, but no credible scientist goes bandying the word "proof" about. Science leaves "proofs" to mathematics and hard liquor.    Keep an open mind and realize that the world is simply not what the mainstream so violently declares it to be.  What "mainstream" is "violently" declaring the world to be what? You're just writing words. None of this means anything.   There are a lot of paths in life including more ion tune with natural energy and those more in tune with defined science, but we are nowhere close enough to declare absolutely that one is right and the other is wrong.  The thing about evidence is that it supports the real; there is no disproving a negative. The "paths" you speak of are more accurately described as those who deal in reality and those who prefer fantasy. As to "right and wrong," if you're not hurting anybody, I could not care less what you believe in.   I don't understand why my view is so violently opposed other than flat out determination to ignore certain things.  I don't think you understand the definition of the word "violent," and if you chose to believe in magical energies, you are the one ignoring certain things, like a burden of proof.   I have no idea what you're talking about but I'm interested.   I had to scroll this far down to find the most sensible comment on this thread.  Hate to state the obvious here, but we live in a capitalist society in which the film industry and the movie theaters are trying to make money. If the 3D version wasn't more financially rewarding, they wouldn't do it. They're not in business to lose money.  So to all of you bitching about this, vote with your dollars. If you already are, assume that the people who prefer 3D are voting with their dollars too and you're being outvoted.   Stop trying to force feed us this gimmick format.   Find me the theater that is forcing anyone to see movies at all, let alone 3D ones. They're making business decisions based on where the money is. If anyone is forcing it, it's the people who like it, who logically are outspending those who don't.   This is the correct answer. The cartoon was the only time any such thing happened.  Wikipedia has a nice write-up of the episode:  The Savage Land appeared in some episodes of the X-Men TV series. It served as the location of Mister Sinister's base. A prominent feature about it was a device designed by Sinister that negated the powers of any mutant in the Savage Land save for Sinister's own forces, rendering the X-Men powerless while fighting him (With the exception of Wolverine's claws as they were a 'bonus' of the Weapon X process, although they would thus cause damage to his hands when used) until the machinery was destroyed. Magneto and Professor X spent much of the show's second season trapped in the Savage Land (Xavier's legs having fortunately been restored as a result of the loss of his powers) until Sinister used them as bait to lure the X-Men into a trap in the season finale, Sinister's forces subsequently being defeated when Wolverine escaped capture and teamed up with Ka-Zar to infiltrate the base and defeat Sinister. In "Savage Land, Savage Heart," the X-Men return to the Savage Land to help Ka-Zar and Shanna fight the threat of Garokk.

I expect this through most of Reddit, but /r/science should be held to a higher standard. Comments indicating that the commenter didn't actually read the linked article should be removed by mods, but that would mean mods having to read every article and comment, and no one has time for that.  I've also noticed more and more that /r/science threads are just filled with personal anecdotes. You'd think anyone with even a passing interest in science would understand the irony.   Nor is your comment, but especially not helpful is people who comment or ask questions without reading the article that is *supposed* to be the subject of discussion here.    Does no one read the article?  Welcome to Reddit where comment threads are knee-jerk reactions to titles that aren't the titles of the linked articles and the articles themselves don't matter.    You're right; my Chakra has been all out of whack lately, but in my defense, us Geminis are prone to that.    it's kind of like how the characters are in kerouac's "on the road" where they were just looking for the next excitement or love affair and there's not really any growth or plot  Another one I didn't find all that exciting and now I'm really getting why. I appreciate the insight and I think I may be well-served by reading a Hemingway biography before delving into more Hemingway, and I may even give The Sun Also Rises another read after all these posts so adeptly defending its merits.   Also, thank you for the explanation of the title. It's actually quite apt now that you've put it in context.  This really has become my favorite sub precisely because of threads like this.

 Takamura Migaki. Took it to work today,very impressed.Sharpest OTB edge I have ever seen.      http://www.chefknivestogo.com/sayas.html   Think about every thing you use or depend on as you go through life and name one thing that could be made without some form of cutting tool.Best I can come up with is crude hand formed pottery.knives are what makes humans human!   Abandon ship!   Cool!   Very nice!   My small town is home to a major hospital and due to my wifes condition we are there quite often .There are  trash cans labled do not touch-bio-hazard in the hallways. They are filled with the sheets and bedding of sick people. Of course the people that change the bedding do not have to wear gloves' and then they go and push elevator buttons,door knobs...ect.   Pisses me off, They treat us like shit,  but the scumbag suppliers can have rats and disease running around the wharehouse because they pay off the  politicicans.   Wear gloves to serve food,customer then picks up condiment containers touched by the last 50 people before him or her and eats. The whole idea is stupid.   The town I grew up in slowley died.   Complicated but here goes...Corupt politicians,Wall street and large corps. basicly drove the local manufacturers out of buisiness.Ocar Meyer, Amour, Bush, Bud, Miller are a few culprits I can pull off the top of my head.They all got tax breaks, excused from quality control,got around labor laws,had excessive requirements  pushed into law that small companies could not afford and the regulators of these laws actually work for these corps.The result was that all the local manufacturing was devasted,the plants were closed and the respected brand names sold off to the corps.. Now with so many people hurting what should we do? Why we start importing tons of second rate shit and add that to our rat infested diseased food products that are made by under paid imported labor,then we open a super store! Why would anyone shop there? Because we spend all the money we saved on quality and labor and spend it all on media adds telling people they are stupid if they pay more and they will be much happier if they save save save! and of course out of work people do need to save.Sorry rambeling here,I just get so pissed. And now I must give credit where credit is due: The man who founded Walmart recognized the needs of the community and workers and Walmarts original plan was to treat the workers very well,which they did .When they opened a dist. center up here in NY back in the 90's they offered great pay and great benefits and I knew alot of people who left their job to go there.Unfortunatley the founder died soon after and the first thing to go was the benefits,then the pay, then the time worked so you could get unemployment when they laid you off for the slow season.   Sears is a very old and once well respected company based on quality, convenience and cutomer service, so yes, if you got it from sears you knew it was good.I do my laundry in a Kenmore washer made about 40yrs ago,sadly that name no longer means what it used to.   Better quality products, more variety,more and better places to shop and a better local economy.Low prices are because they buy the cheapest junk possible in huge bulk lots.A kid could start as a stock boy in a local store, stay with the same store his whole life and make a decent enough living to support a house and family.He would then spend his money at his and other local stores thus helping other kids to do the same,pretty good concept.   Time to put on your walkin shoes.   Every thing the recruiter tells you is a lie,so is the VA. You fought in this war? Your'e on the back shelf till they clear up the guys from the last one.   My last comment on this is that I know skilled line chefs that went to culinary school and take the job seriousley and don't make 15 an hour.   But you don't have to stay there,learn and move on.   So true. Where I work is low pay but we get tips and we are huge busy. Dumb fuckin assholes are too stupid to realise that what they make is up to them. They fuck off, go out to bars and spend all their money,then bitch to the boss that "I make so much more" because I keep a car on the road and pay my bills.   True,all the more reason to man-up and move on.    IT"S A TRANSFORMERS MOVIE FOR CHRIST FUCKING SAKES! What do people expect ,Coppola, Demille,Preminger? It's a movie made for Teen boys, and I am one at heart.Can't wait to see it. Reviewer reminds me of the South park episode where people smell their own farts.   These people are scripted actors and actresses, the goal is to keep people enraged and divided so they won't wake up and turn on the  scumbags who are bleeding us like vampires.    OWNED!   Never owned an apple product but yes,they seem to rely more on image and  social engineering  than quality of product. I do love the WOZ, that man is true.   Good call. You may start with a shit job, but you learn from it,then apply that to a bit better job and so on.    "Eeeasy big fella." Hoss from Bonanza.   OK, I'm not a great fisherman but I do know some things.If you want big ass lake trout you need to find a COLD lake that is very deep. Rainbows and browns can be found in streams and creeks with cold runoff,look for deep holes in the bed or undercut banks. Small mouth bass like cold water and stone bottoms with good current ,same like trout they like cover. Large mouth bass,oh yhea the big boys,like warm water and lots of cover,think lilly pads. The south has the biggest.Pan fish: blue gills, crappy,sun-fish. Pretty easy but if you find some clear water and can see a cleared off circle on the bottom that is their nest and just a hook will do to entice them into attacking.Cat fish like warm rivers or at least a current and are bottom feeders. Hope this helps.   Money is a scam to make rich people richer.   You get to see all the idiots younger  than you make the same mistakes you did and have to deal with them. GOLDEN!   They are here and their name is Washington   Deposited a $100 dollar check in my account. A week later wrote a $20 dollar check to a store,one day later the store tells me my check bounced and I pay the $20 dollar fee. Call bank and bank tells me that my check was not deposited and I now owe them $200 dollars due to overdraft fees.Call bank manager and was told they will look into it. Get letter saying that I now owe $400 because of late fees.Pack up all my paper work and go to bank,call them on all their bullshit and no manager would show his/her face. Get letter with a deposit slip forged in my name for the amount they claimed I owed them.   enough drugs to bring Ozzy to his knees.   The black forest in Germany.   Men should not be emotional,man up and do what you have to do. I work with young guys out of county jails and they are always spouting I'm trying to do the right thing, and all that other parole board impressing nonsense. If you want to do the right thing just shut the fuck up and do it.   I can spot bullshit a mile away. Scammers,posers,manipulaters, you name it. I just cover my own ass because no one believes it anyway. I can't believe how many people just ignore what is right in front of them.   Knowing the habits of the type of fish you are after.

Did pretty good selling beer and french toast off a coleman grill. Ran out of money in Boston and caught a ride down south with a Hells Angel.Car broke down in Maryland and stayed there 2 years working on a camp ground and bought a camper to live in and a car.Got sick of that and loaded everything including my new dog Willy into the car and headed to Fla. with $200 .Got there and set up on a camp ground and had a hard stretch to find work but made it,first into a trailer then  rented a decent house.Back up here since 91 and still with my girl,those were the best years of my life.If you have a job skill and and a set of balls, tits  whatever I say go for it,you might surprise yourself.   " Listen man,I've got to get ready for work" To my very drunk older brother.He was my best friend and mentor when I was a kid,had alot of D/A abuse problems. He had a good heart but my thrice cursed manipulating mother convinced him that a mans worth is only to be a plow horse for a woman. He took out three insurance policies and killed himself just shy of 40yo.My family celebrated that because the wife n kids got a million. I still hate  that I didn't do more to reach out to him.

Back then the space program was everything,people sat glued to the TV for the latest updates. I would buy models of the LEM and the Apollo rockets.I supose that has shaped what I am today as I still follow whatever NASA is doing and I have my scanner programed to the ISS freqs.   12 years old,my brother and I ride our bikes 10 miles to the river to fish. There are abought 20 people already there,all with portable radios. It was 1969 and the first man landed on the moon.   You people sicken me. Do you have a clue about the people that love you? My mother raised her boys to think that thier only worth was to be a plow horse for a woman. As a result my brother Jimmy took out a bunch of insurance policies and killed himself. He was my best friend.   Give poor people a little bit of money for food rent ect... big outrage over giving away our tax dollars,give scum bag criminal bankers over a trillion dollars to party with,no one bats an eye.    My mom devoted her life to  subtley trashing my dad slowly, and raised her kids to hate him ,I did not buy it so when he died she started on me.Fuck You Mom! Happy fathers day!   That after all their hard work , we turned around and sold the country back to the European bankers.   Next morning, "Oh my god we're sinners,we sinned and adultered!"   Been using the 210mm for several months,wow! Convex edge grind+ moly steel=no need for stones ,and stands up to poly boards quite nicely. Two strops, one white and one green keep these paper shredding,hair whittling sharp and they come that way out of the box. Nice fit and finish and the distinct handle gives you a fist full of nice knife.Lovin em,oh yhea saya included.      SOG gets too little love here,enjoy!      Good to know,thanks.   Week day-. lunch bell rings: MMBAAAAA! shuffle to lunch room- weekend, wander around wonder what is this weekend thing.    Retard   Yeah, I am of the same opinion.Just to be clear,I was not looking for advice on what knife to buy for my one and only,just input on this kind of knife/steel from people who actually use them day to day.I have been cooking and collecting knives for decades and if there is one thing I've learned it's that there is no one knife to rule them all.I kind of just "Buy em and try em". The FKMs look real nice  and Mark Richmond gives them a great review,I will make it a point to try one. One question, in the reviews it says they have a 70/30 grind how does this affect sharpening?   Thanks for your interest. I already have the 210 and like it alot,the handle is really comfortable and the blade takes well to stropping.These are cryo treated and I would guess about 59r. and a little less brittle than Vg10.   Thanks for the input,it was acually a toss up between this and Tojiro. I went with the Pro M because I like the handles and the less chippy steel.

I've had it for several years but don't use it as an EDC. I usually remove clips as I don't like them and I use lok-tite when screws get loose.    You have my upvote!   Axe.    This cracked me up,thank you!!!   I envy her!   Actually, benchmade uses FRN on some of their knives. I have a buck with G10 scales  that can't hold a candle to the Vulcan. i don't know what a power lock is, but the Vulcan has an arc lock which is basicly the same as what benchmade has. What makes Benchmade so much higher quality other than the name? Forget the fan-boy stuff,you are only limiting yourself on what knives you use and enjoy.    Flips right out,light and solid as a rock.   Sorry, kind of crappy photo.      Scum bags do what they do,unless they see that they can't get away with it.   Don't piss off the cook.

Most of the videos lately start with Woody saying "Ok, we're recording" which is fine but I think a cool intro like Woody has had on his channel uploads over the years would be better. Just a suggestion, I thought would be nice for the show. Maybe it could be a Patreon milestone or be added to the current animator hiring one, or maybe some guys on the sub-Reddit want to post ideas or videos. I'm trying to take a page out of Woody's book and leave solutions to problems, not just problems. Just a thought, I want to know what you guys think.            	39

 I'm so glad you asked.  One horse-sized duck. I'd take that bastard on all day. But I can't split my attention 100 ways. With the bigun', I can just grab on and start yanking out down. It would be soft and enjoyable for me, and very painful for the horse-sized duck. I would win by pain compliance.   Sloppy. If I have to strategize how I'm going to get it in my face hole, then it's a good sandwich.   Ooooh....you devil.  I'd have to go with...Pierce Brown. Because he's an amazing author that made me miss my bedtime several nights in a row. Bastard. And I think he would be able to do it gritty, but intelligently.  	3

 I know that that is why people play ARAM, all I'm saying is that I bet there's a large amount of people that would move to practice teamfights within the current 'stupid meta'   Not going to lie, I just had a rather frustrating game in ARAM, one of those were you see the loading screen and wish you could go afk if it wasn't for the '9X poppy afk's that would certainly follow.  Then I started thinking, why do I even play this gamemode? You sometimes lose 20 minutes+ of you're time in a game you have no chance of winning.   'I do it for fun, I don't care if we win or lose' Good for you, but my game time/day is limited and I actually do feel a bit frustrated after those game. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not the type of guy that 'likes ARAM as long as we have a good team and win'. I like it because of the teamfights and the practice you get.  Problem with ARAM tough, you're teamcomp is sometimes so random and/or shit that you learn nothing by playing it. So why not make a gamemode where everyone get's assigned 1 role from the current meta and plays a champ that is considered to be that role. Not only would this make it more fair, it would make it a whole lot more realistic because you play with actual comps that you can see in normals/rankeds.  inb4 'Riot doesn't want to enfore the meta' I know they don't, but it's not like it's a serious gamemode right? Plus, the meta is what the players make of it, the current meta is pretty stable, so I don't see how this would be a problem.  TL;DR: Make a gamemode where each member of the team gets assigned a random role and champ BUT within the current meta, making teamfight practice alot more realistic.  Would love to hear all arguments in favor or against my idea, all I know is that I would play this a whole lot more then the current 'get lucky in picks and win' ARAM  Ps: Yes, I know games outside of the meta are being played in rankeds aswell as in the pro circuit but you unfortunately cannot count in every random team comp out there.  EDIT: perhaps there could even be a gamemode besides this one in wich you pre-choose you role and the game then matches you with 4 others, who each have picked another role. In that way, you could practice by example, positioning/orbwalking as an ADC. Or initiating as the tanky top..   Of course she is, she's surrounded by cocks   We're actually on pretty good terms now, we had this period in wich we talked again and got along fine. I also apologised so that helped.. Anyway, she's happy with her bf now so all is good!   I actually did this to a girl, when I was 16 or so.. We didn't see/hear eachother for the entire summer so I tought she'd forgotten about me and it would be super akward when the first day. So I did what a stupid young vou does, dumped her the day before school started.  She didn't talk to me for over a year and I found out aftefwards that she was heartbroken when I ended it. Still feel guilty about that actually..   'Dust2, best map ever'  Whaaat?   Yeah could be, just wanted to point out how well-timed it has to be. Don't know exactly how long it lasts tbh   He casted his ult just at the exact time requiem would hit. This is very hard to pull off because he was under alot of pressure by SK and he had to time it perfectly since there's only like a half second window of invurnability   Well you did an awesome job, looking forward to see your next work!   Holy shit, you're actually really good!! Was a bit afraid when I opened it, 'another LoL parody' but damn, you got talent man!

Wow, first time I see somebody I RES-tagged again and it says 'ejaculates on dead people'.. Hi again!;)   And the idea has gone to shit already..   Why was the original taken down? Btw, HawthornePD just disabled posting on their FB, they we're getting flooded with hate. Too right imo..   Aww man, he would of lived forever if you didn't open it!!   Irrelevant question,  but why did Aphroo stop streaming with a cam? I'm certain that he streamed with one way back when.. Or did he? I'm confused..   D'awww..   Thanks a bunch! I'll try it as soon as I get it. I'll let you know how it went, haha!   I just tested the same build and it worked wonders, the poke you have once the tear is stacked is ridiculous   You better deliver!!   Would love to see it aswell!    I'll definatly give them a look! Thanks a bunch   Thanks for the tip! Have you perhaps got a short explenation or guide on how to apply this? Cheers!   Checked the new post in search for a submission about this game. I'm loving it, alot of teamfights, action packed and Forellenlord absolutly shitting on everyone!! Godlike Ahri plays   Preferably an AZERTY since I've been using it for whole my life and it's the standard in Belgium. I think I could get used to a qwerty however, if the laptop is significally better then the ones with AZERTY   Thanks for sharing you experience!   I'm from Belgium. Wich one do you recommend then?   Hi,  My alienware M14x broke down earlier (spilled drink over it) and I'm looking for a laptop to replace it. I don't want to spend 1500 euro on a laptop again, but I still want one that does very good performance wise, at the same level or better then my previous one.  Here are the specs on my late m14x: -8.192 MB 1.600 MHz Dual Channel DDR3 SDRAM [2 x 4.096]  -3 GB NVIDIA GeForce GT555M   -750 GB (7.200 rpm) serial ATA-hard drive   -Intel Core i7 Processor 2670QM (2,20 GHz, 6 MB cache, Quad Core)   This is the one I was looking at: http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/pdet.to?poid=2000098506$  Would this one suffice? Is Toshiba any good/know for gaming laptops? And please, any further suggestions are welcome! My pricerange is anywhere between 1000 and 1200 euro.  Thank you!   /r/imgoingtohellforthis   If only you had a camera back then, imagine the karma you would have gotten!   You probably never got that mant POINTS for a comment before!!  I'llletmyselfout   A Snoopeh vid on reddit?? Who knew.. Anyway, beautiful steal   That was the moment I closed the stream, too hard to watch :(   You're welcome! I couldn't watch the Twitch stream, it drove me mad so I searched untill this came up      YT stream without lag!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgp0A5xLPBM   How on earth is it possible I watched NA lCS this night on my mobile phone, in bed, with no lag whatsoever. Then watched OGN this morning, a stream from Korea,  lag.  Now I want to watch EU LCS, wich is basically played in my backyard and I just can't because of the horrible lag?? Get yo shit together EU LCS   I honestly wonder who would be the better, more consistent player. Fabby is pretty agressive and can dominate bot as soon as he takes the lead. Aphro however, might be more mechanical (when het gets back to his old level, he's a bit sloppy now) and has more experience playing with a pro team on stages.   3-0'ing a team like Blaze kind of does justice imo.. But I understand what you mean, have an upvote   Just wondering, what's so bad about imageshack? I still use ot from time to time and see no huge flaws   Girl, you're so beautiful, I woud drag my balls through 10 miles of broken glass and rusty nails just to hear you fart through a telephone.

    Forgive my grammar first off. If rob zombie wanted to make a movie where the victim is the story he should have made it a spin off of his own universe. Instead he decided to take an established continuity and shit all over it    home room, very underrated classic   Do we know what the free games for march are?   i was reading Youtube comments and there was alot of hate for, can any of you give me the reason?   i wouldn't call her ugly,  she is one of the most beautiful people i have had the privilege to watch.  in a world so defined by outward appearance its refreshing to see someone with such an amazing personality    id say Halloween 5 after, Michael Myers gets shot to shit and such and falls into the river and the old guy finds him and nurses him back to health      Really wanting to break into that line of work,  Dont need to get paid.  just a way to the project.  sorry if i posted wrong i, wasn't sure how to make this kind of post   Hi im really bored, since i am in a terrible town in Idaho, and it is very cold outside, some company would be awesome,  im a bigger guy so there's the disclaimer, anyway interested pm me   echo mage clearly looks like the gay lawyer on spin city michael boatman http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0090225/?ref_=tt_cl_t2     	12
 his last point was fucking spot on.   I agree. What's your issue with me    Chantix?    It's funny I get down voted for not understanding something. Thank you though.    I learned something today. Thank you.    Til    But...the guy behind her should cover that, right?    They do that with non gmo seed as well...so...   Or you know...we don't even know why she was fired. This has been ridiculous.    Where was this?    So, they have about 3 weeks worth if content?    Jordan Catalono was the bomb in  that flick.    Bald eagle getting a blow job at McDonald's?   Check mate.    No, I'm Keith.    Cheers.    Not me bro so totally wrong.    Could have fooled me while growing up in New England.    7 pounds, eh?    Because a girls football team beat a girls Japanese team. Obviously what *the majority of the 7#@ is thinking about*     oh man i miss pearl jam in that age.   where can i watch it?    Betrayed? Are you kidding me? lol   bro Dazed and Confused.    its almost people like artists/musicians.actors for therre work and could care less about some shit they believe in. I got no beef with tom cruise. I've never met the guy. Never met Beck either but he's my favorite artist of all time. Why do the weird shitty beliefs of famous people matter?    no, you like his acting. It's a very different thing. You never actually liked the guy, okay?   that was a time of pink floyd we dont like to talk about.    probably looks no different than any other group of drunk zombies spilling out of a bar...   i really want to imagine the cats are listening to that song and really getting into it with eyes closed etc...   that was actually pretty fucking cool. not my kind of music and that lead singer looked pretty um...scary but the visual aspect was rad.    No, its from Two men and a Baby.   local h shows in new londfon ct back in 96 am i right?   That's what I thought. Cool. Checking in from Niantic.    Fuckers invaded my small little Connecticut town and burned our ships and houses up.    Bro they burned my hometown down in Connecticut.    Yes on the last two. I use a boss br8 to record them back in 99. I don't have that anymore.   I have an iPad as well. Am I going to be able to somehow get them there two?    I'm sorry I mean like what program can I use to mix them together as they are just seperate files of tracks.    Lol that's what I thought when I first saw it. Thinking of making a tag for such titles. How about just "bang up job on title, OP"    hey guys :) -CT   You said something that was incorrect in a smart ass way and I just corrected you the same way, that is all.    lol at the balogne   where I am there is no notice.   sweet fucking t-shirt.   magnolia?   random but how did you come about to find reddit and this sub? Was it from an app?   I've learned that if I really want to see something it's probably not gonna be on Netflix.    That medium you're talking about. What do I use to be able to here the full track as opposed to just one by one and then also mix them etc.   Click of death?    This is an amazing thread.    Fucking  well said    What can i use to bring them up together?    What can I use to bring them up and have them together?       its all; real lobster...North Atlantic meat. The majority of places you might buy a lobster roll might use the same product but mcds is fucking huge and thats why they can make it for 8 bucks.   I get your DAE McDonalds is the devil but your're completely wrong...and thats why opinion on social media turns into fact, Yikes.   Interesting. I was a Connecticut transplant to Seattle and have been back in ct for about ten years now. Seattle was a fun city spend my 20s.   East Lyme.    Average. Wasn't horrible.    No, just North Atlantic lobster.    It's a kitten fish    At first I thought you were talking about hemorrhoids.    Do you know why she was fired?    Hear hear.    mcds uses lobster   Why were you down voted?    Can't put my finger on it but damn.       Mcds is real lobster. Haven't tried Chipotle yet but I'm sure it is as well.    just while you guys were on the context of chipotle I thought I would throw it in there. I have had both and actually prefer moes. I recommend it for sure. Not sure if your local one does this but the one by me has crazy promotions when uconn plays and wins. at one point last year when they had a great streak burritos were down to like 3 bucks or something normally 8.   are we ever going to know exactly why she was fired? Have I just missed an explanation somewhere? Did she poop on the carpet or something?   Man, am I living in the twilight zone?   how many lobster rolls am I buying?    okay, or how about we just have a meetup for that. So Connecticut!  Oh, you guys met at a park and played frisbee?  Psh, were gonna just go eat some lobster...   thanks duder.   have you ever tried moes?   awesome vid. saving that one to pull out at some point.    East Lyme.    I understand. I suppose I would just rather eat lobster with only butter in any capacity.   When mayo is added it just reminds me of the fake seafood salad from a deli. While I still eat it and dont mind it I just prefer it the other way, Look at us, two opinions in a box.   where else am I supposed to put mcdonalds fast food?            Did you just say meow?    its probably my favorite comedy show besides Seinfeld...and that's saying something...because I have impeccable taste.    just watched this episode the other day. lol. i love when that show points out dumb shit in the world.   where does multi level marketing fall into these categories?   seriously, though. I thought they were defaults by now.   and /r/ChildrenFallingOver    oh bro. its been my jam for a while now.   did it have sardines in it?   /r/childrenfallingover   it was beautiful, right?

Wonder what ever happened with that lol.    Lol. Funny thing. Last week I went to my mom's house to finally clear out my stuff in the basement (I'm 36) and I came across some amazing things but on of them was my junior prom commemorative glass. It was a beer mug. Lol. They still do that?    Clas of 96?   Abscessed pilonidial cyst?    I recently moved to the area, Niantic. We just have metrocast. So far so good as advertised.    Free money? Oh yeah.   Oh.   Taxes.    I'm a catering chef in old Saybrook. When you say affordable what is your per person budget?    Your mom texts? My mom can't even figure out how to read incoming texts.    They got started at Wesleyan and this looks like a pretty early gig for them. One of my favorite songs of all time and they did an "ok" job for two guys with a sequencer and some mics.   I can dig it.       Why do you think that is?    I like to call it not Monday.    Bro I hadnt ever even seen that movie until I was in my 30's. Vats of  man tears for days.   It's how do you say "freaking awesome looking"    I feel your pain on the booze and smokes.    "non profit"    Huh?    It's a work knife. I never use my personal knives at work. We get a fresh batch once a week. They aren't the best but get the job done. Pun intended.    Wrong, again.    and here's a utility chefs knife for you, [kind sir](http://i.imgur.com/HA1lCsy.jpg)   It's always the wrong decision and that's final.    Well, I guess we disagree.    I've been in the industry for 25 years almost and have never witnessed anyone do something like that.    Get into catering. Best move I ever made. Fuck line work.    Can confirm. Just got done with a 14 hour day. Back to work for another one in the morning but not before 11 vodkas.    Wow, today I learned the self titled was mediocre.    Vocal fry?    go watch the original movie. its phenom   deep river connecticut   now that music video is some grade a cringe material.   it's also a theme song to a tv show and i can't for the life of me remember which one. it's killing me.    what show is it from? It's on the tip of my tongue.   its from show that I can't put my finger on right now. anyone?   He honestly really annoys me and I can't put my finger on it.    General Hospital?    B   Oh shit . I do remember that. Hilarious.    I always see this and it always makes me laugh but what is the original origin of it?    Fuckin  guitar picks, how do they work?    Yep. Stood out on the beach actually.    A place for rich white guys to drink heavily and piss on trees, right?    What kind of person doesnt have toilet paper...male or female?   Yum. Bathroom floor pillows.    Oh, so you're  a bit heavy set like me?    Golden.       Seriously, though. I was just at Niantic Bay and I thought for a second I was going to die.    This town has everything. Gonna enjoy this summer.    Sort iif small town. Right on long Island sound. Beach town. Near old Saybrook . 20 minutes from new Haven.    No, that's correct.    Recently moved to Niantic. Love it here.    What a weird place to come across a post involving Westbrook.    Happy birthday good old buddy old Pam.    Oh, I know. I was at 2 packs a day for 20 years. quit and then fucked up after almost two years off. Currently quitting again.   I just mean is smoking not known as such a health issue there.   Yes and no. You do fall asleep but stop breathing many times an hour. I was at 35 times an hour. So, you never really get a full nights sleep.    Same thing recent but the nose mask isn't working. I guess I'm a full on mouth breather so that one is coming I the mail. Can't wait for a  regular nights sleep.    I recently did one. It was a take home one. Diagnosed with sleep apnea.    hey look, when trucks still had beds.   That's what that one girl said in the documentary.    what is wrong with you?   yah, that was tough. Seemed like a real sweet guy as opposed to those other douchebags.   So, smoking is just kinda cool with everyone to the point that pregnant chicks just do it? Is that a West Virginia thing? Are smokes just like crazy cheap?  The area looked beautiful. What do rents go for in that town? How are people affording 600-800 a day habits?   on my 5th.

 I have a ddj sx for home use and it's more than capable of serving my needs.   The only down side is that it requires a laptop and Serato.   It's time consuming enough to keep your music collection updated and organized in Serato, but you would have to prep your tracks again in rekordbox if you want to use them with cdjs.  If you're set on a controller, I would recommend the xdj rx. It's a standalone unit that doesn't require a laptop. It uses rekordbox so you just have to manage one music collection. It has the stacked wave forms (Which I think is the major advantage of software driven setups).       This guy, asking the important questions.   So they can reach go marry their own respective gay lovers. The long con...   I've easily filled up a 750ml wine bottle before.   It would probably help I'd you mentioned if it was a male or female vocalist. Who the dj was, that was spinning the set.   No luck whatsoever trying to pin down your track.

Holy shit, you don't even look like the same person. Good work.   Not sure why people are hating on your nice mattress.   Your debt shouldn't be that difficult to overcome. Like others have stated, get your spending under control. Plan to "disappear" from the social even for at least 6 months. Find a hobby that costs little money. I'd suggest done self improvement, like working out.  This way when you get home from work, you have your obligation to go work out and you won't be tempted by vices, such as going out.  Budget as much of your income as you can to paying off the credit card. And I mean actually sit down and draft a budget.  In 6 to 8 months you'll have made a significant dent in your debt and you'll be a healthier you.   Get off reddit and go practice driving.   Ouch, this cuts deep.    Justin Bieber.

You might like Allen   Envy, they do a lot of vocals, but I tend to get tired of their bassline after a while.

"Just following orders" is great and all, but there's a very obvious line where that needs to be broken for the sake of not being a fucking idiot.  You're giving them too much credit by assuming there was a single person in this situation that wasn't an idiot.   ALE HOUSE   It's ok. No need to get upset about it. In fact, it's useless to give diet advice to others. I avoid giving advice unless it's solicited of me.  I always post pictures of bacon, steaks, korean bbq, and other "fattening" foods on instagram. When people ask how I stay slim, I tell them it's because I eat bacon all day, everyday.   They laugh because they think I'm joking.   **Things I have done:**  - Graduated college (BA in Business).  - Lost 30 pounds (180lbs to 150lbs, 6ft tall).  - Broke up with gf, got a new gf.  - Got a new job.  - Wrecked my car, got a new car.  - Paid all credit card debt.  - Quit smoking (after 10 years).      **Things I've yet to do:**  - Get my own place.  - Open my own restaurant.  - Take an actual vacation to Europe/Asia.     Insights: thanks for this OP. I was feeling down about myself, but upon reflecting, my life isn't so bad after all. I just need some capital to start my business.    Your assumption is incorrect.

If it's very minor damage then you'll be lucky if your insurance company can get his insurance to pay for a new hood and bumper. More than likely, it will be a repaint.  You need to call your insurance company and tell them what happened.   You should go to at least 3 body shops to get an estimate on repairs. Estimates are free. I would suggest going to the most expensive body shops you can find. A higher estimate is in your favor.  Once fault is determined, your insurance company will offer 2 ways to receive payment: either they cut the check to the body shop that you fix your car at or they issue you a check.  I would choose to take the check personally. Then go to any body shop and have them repair the car.    Lol   Even with oil prices down, gas prices in California have risen.

 you can even just sit down at a table, load up the app and order a meal.  They'll bring the food right to your table.  you need and NFC enabled phone though.  They have little stickers on the underside of the tables that know which table is which.   I just want the moto assist apk to work on the stock Nexus 6.   Hope they are able to extract it and we can just side load it.   They've had kittens in Seattle too    I understand what that means, it was just my dark humor that made me laugh at that comment.  "We were praying to God to answer our prayers, then a tragedy happened.  We want REAL answers now."    Way too soon, but you have to find humor in the darkest of places, otherwise this world would be too bleak for most.   "We want some real answers now," one of the worshippers was heard saying.  What were they asking for before?  Fake ones? From whom?   I had a cat that had this but only in one eye.  He was a badass siamese that out lived 9 other cats.  He was 20 years old.   300+ comments saying it's amazing.   I couldn't stand the animation style and all the characters annoyed me outside of McGurk   Sports coupe.  It has a back seat.  Trust me it's better that way when it comes to insurance   Sign up, Day 1 no invite, waze 2nd to top never played ingress   or PS4 version of Final Fantasy 7?   right. I've been to where it was.  The shot I was talking about looks really similar.  Since he might have "seen" it somewhere, I was offering suggestions.   I think they shot the scene in Transformers 4 where marky mark is getting chased by the cia dude in what would be there.  It's not. but it was close.   I lived in a snowy place when I got my G37S.  I wouldn't buy an automatic, so no X for me.  No idea why they don't make an AWD model with a manual transmission.     when you turn the key you are making connections from the switch to the starter, then the engine turns to start up.  There is the CPU in the middle of all that, but that's the simplest thing to check.  It's the wiring somewhere (sensors or otherwise) or the starter is dead.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVg59KB9VEA   "I graduated high school in xxxx."  I own a successful business and have a 6 figure income, but I never really attended school my senior year.  I did go to a community college for 1 year and did a technical school program (very little is used as the main part of my current job).  I don't need a piece of paper to tell me how smart I am.  School was boring and I only went to the classes I liked such as physics, math, etc.    Don't forget about the rare earth elements that are magnetic (Nd being the most prolific).   Adamantium could share properties with the lanthanoid group.  Aluminum isn't normally magnetic, but when it passes over an eddy current, it can be pushed away when other things like plastic wouldn't be. This is used in recycling centers.  So your theory is sound where he could manipulate all kinds of fields to make any metal bow to his whim.    I'm partial to their Crepes.  MMMMM.... strawberry goodness.   Most of my mkv files aren't working at all. Any reason they wouldn't? Mp4 works fine   10 years in Texas (usually coke), then 25 in the PNW (usually Pop).  But it's a soda to me.     in one charge.  However, a 20 min stop over at a supercharging station will do it.   Looks like I'm going to have to buy another PS4.  I just jizzed all over my current one and broke it.   No war on domestic soil   No war on domestic soil   Use good oil, and keep the filters changed.  It's not that much more than any other car.  Parts are specific to Infiniti, but there are aftermarket versions if you need to save a few bucks   my biggest gripe was that I would totally clear out a room, searching every inch of it making sure it's clear....but NOOOO, the monster behind the wall wouldn't come out until AFTER I go down the hall and it pops out behind me.     Main parts of the car are all but bulletproof if you keep up on the fluids and filter maintenance.   Some have reported odd minor electrical stuff.  Apparently the 6MT's have an issue with the clutch slave cylinder, but that's all I know of.  Other than that, they are really good reliable cars.  I've had mine for 4 years and just the clutch thing has gone wrong.   Actually, it's called neural adaptation.  You nose doesn't smell anything.  Your brain does.   In hotels, the more you pay, the less you get.  $80-$110 is the sweet spot where you get a decent room, free hot breakfast and free WiFi   This happened to me recently.  What it was for me was an app that I installed that called for the location via GPS every so often.  The GPS call used the play services, so that is what was reported as using the battery instead of the app that made the call.   Find when this started, then find what app you installed around then and uninstall it   Wildstar?   Nothing here either.   And I thought move had low miles with 66k.  That's pretty good   Here's why I'm guessing.  Nationally, traffic is going to be heavier in the afternoons no matter what.  Not everyone goes to work at the same time.  However, more people do things in the afternoons than mornings.  You errands that you have to do, the activities you want to do, etc.  So that adds more cars.  Now think of how I-5S is laid out.  We'll address it in 2 sections.  North of Northgate and South of Northgate.    South of Northgate you have 45th, 65th, 80th, Northgate streets are basically the only places you can get on I-5S if you want to go into the city.  Plus 522 feeds into I-5 in between 80th and 65th.  So these 5 spots serve all of NE Seattle, Lake City, Greenlake, Wallingford, UW, Northgate, etc.  So more people are going to travel to the city in the evening (sporting games, nightlife, etc) and I-5 before 45th is really the only option for those people to take to get across the water.  This means there is always more people getting on I-5 than getting off until after 45th.  So the 3 lanes possible fill up to capacity very fast, causing a chain slowdown from people merging from the on ramps.  This gets worse and worse on north.   Now think about all the people that live north of Northgate that are also going to the city (or coming home from Boeing in Everett and other places).  North of Northgate I-5 is 4 lanes + HOV lane.  At Northgate, the HOV ends and becomes I-5 Express, but that's only in the morning, so you are losing one lane.  Then the far right lane turns into an Exit Only lane, so you go from 5 to 3 lanes just south of Northgate.  So that bottleneck starts the backup from there on north.  Most days this is where the traffic really starts to crawl.  However like today, there was both a really big demand on both sections of I-5 and that's why it was slow for 10+ miles.  Remember, this happened with NO ADVERSE WEATHER OR ACCIDENTS!.  Add a wreck into that mix and you have a 2h commute from Everett to Seattle...at 3pm.  Thursday I was headed to the financial district from Lynnwood at 5pm.  My gps told me to exit i-5 at shoreline, cross over to greenwood, take greenwood to holman then holman turns into 15th and take that all the way down to elliot and take that into downtown.  It said it was 15 min faster.  I'd love to see, just as an experiment, to keep the I-5 express open southbound only all day.  Would it alleviate the SB traffic more than hinder the NB?  Like, would it cut 20 min of SB traffic, but only add 10 min to the NB?   Better than rusting from the inside out.   Oregon uses the cinders from the volcanic areas around there.  Works really well for the cars, not so much for the roads.  But that's in combination with the studs and chains    G37 coupes have 330 horsepower, S or no S. IPL trim will have the 348 HP engine, but with negligible (.1) increase in 0-60 mph time at best, with most magazines quoting no increase in acceleration.  I said they are 333hp.  I'm sure being 3 off isn't that wrong.   All the Infiniti G models are based on the FM platform. Maxima is based on the FWD platform, totally different cars.   While I'm sure you are technically correct (the best kind).  There is definitely something similar between them.  If you look at the interior of a maxima, then the interior of the sedan, you can see why I say what it's based on.  I'm not saying it uses the same chassis, but when they designed it, they said, "that worked, lets go from there".  Same thing with the coupe and a Z.  The interiors are very similar, but with an added back seat.  I'll revise my statement to say they are "inspired" by them.   he sedan is actually lighter than the coupe by 50? or so pounds, but sedan has a slightly softer suspension. Once tuned to the same suspension and using the same wheels as the coupe (for sedan, wheels are 17 or 18 inches, while for coupe, wheels are 18 or 19 inches), the sedan will be more sporty due to its lighter weight.  Just like the 330 vs 348 hp, 50lbs isn't going to make that much of a difference.  I have driven, in a track environment, a 350z and my G37s.  I have also put thousands of miles in a G35xS sedan and a few in a 370z.   I can tell you unequivocally that sport coupe is a FAR better drivers car, which is why I recommended it over the sedan.  The sedan is a decent performance car for sure, but I wouldn't call it a drivers car.  It has mainly to do with the transmission I'd bet.  I've not seen a sedan with the 6MT, let alone driven one.  I'd like to find one and go do some laps to see if I can tell the difference.   As for the X looking off, here's a comparison of the post-refresh G37 coupes, journey and X. Tell me that you can tell a difference between them, other than the X on the back.  Yup, sure can.  It's the wheel well arches.  The way the X sits, it looks just ever so higher than the RWD because there is more gap in the wheel wells with the factory tires.  The stance of the RWD is just right, and the x looks like it has been lifted .5-1 in.   It might be more noticeable to me since I have seen my coupe every day for years.   The issue actually comes from the hospital's chargemaster.  It's an arbitrary list of all things that a hospital can do and how much that costs.   THIS is where the insurance companies are starting the negotiations from.  Hospitals know this, and have been artificially inflating the prices of everything so that they get what they want from the insurance companies.  Kind of like a store marking up products a bunch just to then say, "EVERYTHING 30% OFF!!, WHAT A DEAL! FEEL FORTUNATE THAT YOU ARE GETTING SUCH A GOOD PRICE".    This is where the hospitals claim that they are taking big losses from Medicare/Medicaid.  Because Medicare/Medicaid is paying what things SHOULD cost based on tons of research.  When the govt. is paying only 20% of what the chargemaster says, the hospital claims that they are losing money on it.  It should read that they are losing PROFIT from it.  There is still a profit margin built in to Medicare/Medicaid, but it's not what hospitals are used to.   This is how uninsured people get double screwed.  If you don't have insurance, then you are billed what ever the chargemaster price is for that service.  A price that is by design, way too high and never intended for anyone to actually pay.

I couldn't bargain hunt even when I had plenty of time.   I tweaked my knee and need minor surgery to fix it.  I didn't have insurance at the time (end of 2013).  So I went in to get a diagnostic to tell me what was needed to get it fixed.  The doctor told me what he needed to do and how to schedule it.  When I went to the station to schedule it I wanted to know how much it was going to cost.  She couldn't tell me.  She said it's going to be these 3 billing codes, plus the doctor fee, plus the anesthesiologist fee, plus the facility charge.  She had no idea, even to ball park, how much those fees would be.  I called all around and never got a straight answer about how much it was going to be.  Unless you have menu-like prices that are are easily accessed and transparent, then it's not a free market.   All medical bills should come in a form of a "not to exceed" quote BEFORE anything happens.  That would make it more open to a "free market"    Even those classified as non-profit, still make tons of profit.  You should read [The Bitter Pill](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=1 ved=0CB8QFjAA url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uta.edu%2Ffaculty%2Fstory%2F2311%2FMisc%2F2013%2C2%2C26%2CMedicalCostsDemandAndGreed.pdf ei=Kmp2Ve2RFIfqoAS01KHABA usg=AFQjCNFxCmH0gVmFVmQWkQNWZgcfsR1jYA sig2=d6dq0-ijHYCe1CbqzRdZEw) a 42 page article that really addresses the problems with Healthcare in its current state.   There's even a little distortion on cash's version too. Not a whole lot, but you can tell it's there.   It's all about what you want in a car.  Are you looking for a proper drivers car?  Get an 08+ G37S coupe 6MT.  It's 333 hp, handles like a 370Z and has options for all the luxury items (nav, backup camera, etc).  If you want a more family frendly practical car, you can get the sedan.  It's based more on the Maxima than the Z, so it doesn't handle as well, but it has a much larger trunk, 4 doors and more room in the cabin.  Same features are available on it as the coupe.  If you live where it snows, then you can get the X models of either, the only major issue for me is there is no manual transmission available with the AWD models.  On the coupes, the X looks....off.  Something about it just doesn't seem to look as good as the RWD ones.  I can spot an X a mile away.   I like the blue oyster cult cover via iPad a bit better.  Needs more cowbell.   My wife is going through a boot camp for software development.  They have been hammering home that concept.  Apparently it's really really common    [Relevant penny arcade](http://art.penny-arcade.com/photos/i-NccB8SH/0/1050x10000/i-NccB8SH-1050x10000.jpg)   They are totally different songs even though it's the same lyrics and notes.  Trent was angst and despair.  Cash was sad and melancholy.   See my other response. I might have been a test store, but I interviewed people only after they had passed the test.   I went north to Lynnwood.  Brand new houses being built all over.  More shopping, more parking (free most of the time), all pretty close.  Down side is less trendy places (might be a good thing?), more commute times.  But it doesn't mean you can't go to Ballard, or Cap hill for a night out.  You won't do it as often, but it'll feel like a treat each time you do.   Barry/Jill = Top 10% earners, value time more than money.  Buzz = younger people that liked new tech (there were several variances)  Charlie/Helen = Empty nesters, not very techy, want a trusted source for help and advice.  Ray/Maria = Middle america, family time is most important, most likely to finance things.  This is still in my brain 10 years after I learned it.     Yeah, well, it was a little different for the Mobile Managers. They were the only hourly "Manager"  We had similar responsibilities, except I didn't have keys to the store.  My $21/hr + (up to) 40% bonuses was $29.40/hr.  I was hitting bonuses most of the time, so I ended up around $55k/yr.    The proper managers were salaried employees.  As such, they were scheduled for 11/hrs a day with 1 hour for lunch, so 50 hours a week.  When the holidays came around, they had to work 60 hours a week.  When you take their salary (around $60k) and divide it by the number of hours worked, it was around $22/hr.  These managers had bonusing potential, but in my particular store, it never happened.  It was based on the overall store numbers instead of just one department (like I did).   Everytime I've had a RAID 0 system on my computer, it has always ended in tears losing the array for one hardware/firmware issue after another.   I just went with the WD Raptor line until SSD's were relatively affordable.   FACE is a marvel of software design and was developed by primarily one guy.   I'm not sure how much he got paid, but it pales in comparison to how much he could have sold that on the open market.   Man, I HATED AJU when it was first rolled out.  My connection numbers were dismal.  I would fix it myself faster and better than they could.  90% of the time it was technology issues.  The AJU people were capable enough, but they would lose connections constantly and it would get stuck for a day/night and the next morning we'd have to fix it ourselves anyway.  AJU murdered my turn time.   It might have only been a short lived thing.  The DA's definitely had to take a test, but I hired a few people in my days as a supervisor (2006-2008).  All of them had to pass the test before I interviewed them for a CIA spot.  It was implemented a year or so after I was hired.  Maybe it never took, and I was a test store.   I was classified as a Barry-5 back in the day. I'm still a "My Best Buy Premier elite" member.  I knew the in's and outs of the PSP and presented to the management the situation and the solution, so they just approved it.   GS sup from 2005-2008.  Slowest computer?  I think it was a PII 450mhz.  I just sold him a new computer and transferred the little data he wanted. :  There were always hardware failures that we couldn't "Fix" because we couldn't/didn't have the parts to replace.  Most of the time if it got to that point, the labor was almost the cost of a new computer, so we just sold a new computer then.  I was lucky that at that time, there was me and one other guy with tons of experience with computers in our department.  This was before they had centralized computer repair facilities or internet based repairs.  If I couldn't figure out the issue, he could.  If he couldn't fix it, I could.  We taught the rest of the crew as best we could, but we couldn't teach things they never saw before until it was presented to them.  Not a lot of substitution for experience in the tech world.  Especially when you are dealing with the massive variability in customers computers.  Now-a-days, everything is just a google away.  But pre Vista, knowing DOS commands and how to mount OS' from CD to clean up system file hijacking processes weren't taught to GS, you had to know.   I'm sure it would make a good youtube "prank" vid.   right..that's why I said pseudo.  It wasn't any CompTIA thing at all, but since I took both, they were similar.   That's standard for any software developer.  It's a legal thing.  I've seen threads around here that explain it more than I'm willing to right now.   They do that for all employees now?  They used to only have that for BBYM staff.    I was the Geek Squad Supervisor going for the Assistant Manager spot when season 1 aired. It was oddly similar to my life at the time...minus the hot chick and spy email that downloads things to my brain.   If you expect that something is overpriced and you can wait and get a better deal elsewhere, do it.  No one is forcing you to buy it.  They are just presenting you with the option for instant gratification.   Yeah, I made an Ultimate Boot CD for us at our own precinct.    I was basically Chuck when Chuck first aired, minus the email.  I was the supervisor of Geek Squad, going for an Assistant Manager position.   Oddly accurate at that time of my life.  So... question 1: no  q2: nope, I wanted to get to management and be the district services manager.  Q3: yes, they always have  Q4: what a geek would normally do.  Video games, movies, avoid social interactions, etc.   You don't need much as far as proper schooling goes.  You used to have to pass a pseudo A+ test to qualify.    man, I was SOOO bummed when the Caturday thread go autodeleted because no one posted there for 14 days.   OT was the best section   Anyone that knows how to get a linux box up and running wouldn't have to bring it to Geek Squad.  The only time I worked on one in the 2.5 years I was in that department was when my step-brother bought a $100 laptop that had Red Hat installed and couldn't figure out how to work it.   You are basically paying a deductible, similar to any insurance sold anywhere else.  It's shitty, but if you didn't know what you are doing, $150 deductible + monthly  charge is usually better than a $500-$600 for a brand new phone.   I actually got my supervisor spot because of that very thing back in 2006.  Data privacy wasn't as strict as it is now.  The supervisor at the time was caught by a female returns employee going through a computer and had opened up some porn on the computer.  This lead to an investigation where he had transferred some files of a customer to a personal flash drive.  There were several other stories from other stores around the country that got to the media and that's when they started implementing all the super strict data protection policies.    Turn over is an issue with all retail employees.  They don't pay amazing when you are just a sales guy, but if you can get into middle management, then it's a decent living.  Getting there is tough though.  Most of the sales staff are kids going to school or didn't finish school so this is the best job they can get.  Once out of college, they go and get a real job.  As far as the sales staff, they have online based training that they have to go through.  However, it's mostly process based (how to clock in, how to order something for a customer, how to run the register) then they get a separate section of training that is specific to their department.  It's not updated as often as the technology changes, so keeping up with the new things that come in, why they are good, and who would benefit from them is learned day to day from other, more experienced people.  The really good sales people have a passion for the stuff they are selling and have done the research on their own time before it shows up and are excited to see it/play with it.  You must have talked with the former instead of the latter.   "Overpriced and unnecessary services" to you perhaps.  The price of the complete solution in one stop is worth more than scrounging around the internet looking for the best deal on whatever it is I want.  You don't sell out of your own pocket.  If I came in to buy an entire home theater, you best sell me everything I need so I don't have to come back or worry about the installation.  The services are even more valuable to those without the skill set to do it themselves.  I've purchased around $50000 worth of stuff from Best Buy in the last 10 years and I'll get the service plans on the big items, especially the damage (ADH) ones.  I've only not used it about 20% of the time.  80% of the time I've utilized the PSP/ADH and got my money's worth at least and came out ahead more often than not.    In 2005-2008 they had the "Advanced Diagnostic and Repair".  It was $199.  EVERY computer that wouldn't turn on or we couldn't figure out/fix in 5 min was sold this.  If it didn't make it past the initial diagnostics (like bad HDD), the $199 was refunded/applied to a new computer - the $59 diagnostic.    They measured how many ADRs, diags, hardware installs along with your average turn around time.  You wanted high ADRs, low diags and low turn time.  PSP's weren't really measured at GS directly because if you were in the computer section, you were absolutely supposed to offer them, but it went to the computer dept numbers.   Yeah, MRI 5.0+ had FACE.   I was an agent right when Geek Squad was integrated with Best Buy in 2005.  It was silly how much freeware we used to remove viruses.   When FACE (Facilitate Accuracy, Consistency, and Efficiency)  was rolled out, I was really impressed with the software. We called it Forget About Computer Expertise because it was designed for a monkey to pop in a cd, boot up and hit a few buttons and walk away.     The starting pay depends on your area.  Best Buy has pay grades assigned to every position and a national average range for each grade.  A Geek Squad counter agent was grade 5.  Then it factors to your location.  Bend, OR was +10% of average.  Lynnwood, Wa was +25% (the highest possible).  So if the grade 5 position was $11/hr average, then the WA store would start at $13.75.  I started at $13.50 because I asked for $15 back in 2005.  I got to $21 + bonuses (ended up ~$55k/yr) when I was a BBYM manager.  So it wasn't terrible money, but it didn't make me rich.   I started full-time at $13.50 and was up to $18 before moving departments. So it wasn't bad, but I wasn't rolling in dough.   ---former Geek Squad Supervisor (2006-2010).  You used to have to pass a pseudo-A+ exam to be an agent in the stores.  A harder one for the in home guy.    Got those two chronologically mixed up.   Wasn't that his big break out role?   I had a guy that was training me at Geek Squad.  We were opening a new store so the Senior tech from the closest city came in to train all of us.  There were like 6 of us.  For 2 days he had been showing us where the customer file folders were going for each stage of repair and record keeping.  Since Geek Squad takes a page out of NASA, the folders were called dossiers.   For 2 days he kept saying, "You take the customer's paperwork, and you put it in the dozer."  Remember, he was the top guy at this other store, so I'm not sure how long he'd worked there, with who knows how many other people.  No one had corrected him.   I finally had to stop and correct him when I couldn't take it any more.  Dossier = DOS-e-a   So, he's just cosplaying himself since he was the voice of that character in the 2nd one?   It depends on how you wash them.  If you pour liquid detergent directly on them while in an older, non front loading unit, then you will see "stains" of glowing sections of where you poured it.  If you use liquid soap on a modern unit, all the jeans will glow just a little bit.  I don't think it works with powdered soap.  I remember going to a club after just washing my jeans in the old style washer and it looked like I had a massive cum stain all down the front of my pants under the black light.  Never poured the soap in last again.   ITT: ALL OF THEM   Seems like the blues guitar equivalent of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbZ1BaNxAoc) (but [she](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendee_Rose_Tenerefe) got signed to Warner Music Philippines because of it)    I was completely prepared for bits of deer that had replaced the outer panels of car along the entire passenger side.      Needs something like [this](http://gfycat.com/VastEnergeticDiamondbackrattlesnake)   Over...almost.  I can't type. Oh well.  It's 1.8M miles and averaging ~10000/wk.  Can't wait until all commuter traffic are these things and I can have my sports car to have fun in without being worried someone will plow into it.      Very similar to mine, but in a sedan.   There was some strategic driving.  I was going closer to 80 when I saw it. I was trying to avoid it all together, but there was a good deal of luck to contact how it did   I had 2 10" Boston G2 subs in a standard square box from my previous car, along with a 1000w @ 1 ohm mono block amp.  I paid them $800 for the enclosure + installation of sub and the installation of the amp. Since these are dual voice coil subs, they are wired @ 2 ohm so the amp is at 500w now (still plenty).  In my '08 coupe with the Bose system, I'm not sure 100% sure there even was a sub to remove.  It's not there now if it was.    I think it's illegal as well.   I hit a deer at 50mph in a 350z.  It was my step dads.  I thought I had tons of damage, but it seemed to drive fine, so I kept going.  Didn't stop to evaluate anything and I could see in the rear view that the deer was totally dead.  When I got to my friends house, I thought he was messing with me when he said, "I thought you said you hit something?".  I get out.  The only damage was a missing sideview mirror, a smashed corner of the windshield, and a scrape on the passenger window.  That's it.  I had managed to time it just so that he jumped, stuck his neck out and his head (it had small horns) hit the window and his neck hit the A pillar. That spun him around taking out the mirror and a hoof caught the window just barely.  It was only a few hundred is repairs.   Here's the post I did about it after I got it. http://www.reddit.com/r/infiniti/comments/2p272t/stillen_catback_exhaust_first_impressions/  Now after having it 5 months, it hasn't seemed to "break in" at all. Still sounds the same.  There is still no drone, however I've heard that the 7AT will have a drone to it at hwy speeds, so be ready for that since you can't get a manual and AWD in the same car (which is lame)    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw41sSRZ4mU this is my comparison from stock to the Stillen exhaust that I got.  After literally years of going over exhaust choices, I'm glad I got this one.   OEM...like Original Equipment?  The one the car has?  I don't understand the question.   I took mine to a shop and they did [this](http://i.imgur.com/NU2dsRZ.jpg)  It still has the factory everything and the amp for this is under the spare panel on the opposite side of the sub.  This worked well because the optimum space for that 10" is .5 cu ft.  So they fiberglassed it to fit the little nook behind the wheel well arch which was just about that space.    It looks like it came from the factory and still have use of my trunk.  It sounds really good. Not over bearing.   Since you have the sedan, you have a lot more room to work with, but if you still want use of the trunk, this might be a good starting point.   Best looking, sounding, handling, accelerating car with a excellent interior and decent practically all for under $20k.  I don't think there is a better car for the money.   How do you get to Carnegie Hall?   http://puu.sh/iboWJ/6707c653c6.jpg  Looks like I'll be going to sea to watch this show.   My charging cord was DOA.  Try a different charger just in case?   Hell of a repost then.    earthlink.net is still a thing?  Wow   I'm in the suburbs.  It's nice.  Store fronts have parking. Everything is pretty close to me.  Going to ballard or cap hill is "going out", so it's an adventure, not the norm.   Some seem to be just trying to hard to be different.  That or the original song I didn't like in the first place.  Me and my wife just hit play on their channel one night and it was getting to the point where we just had enough after like 45 min.  Some of their songs are good.  But the concept in general is only good in doses for me.   They are hit and miss for me.    	106
 HIVmind "Intelligence"   When your product comes packaged like this in the first place.   [Correct](https://www.facebook.com/healthgoth)   Looks like an accurate depiction of market share of wood pallets nearly.   [This guy always intrigued me.](https://i.imgur.com/9dgDj.jpg)   Oh no lookit the little prementum!

Cranky prestidigitating folks like you will make sure I stay doing my job instead of socializing. :D   This is silly, companies that make that much money on selling phones should just replace the device, and companies that make different voltage ratings for chargers on purpose are the ones spurring this problem in the first place IMO. USB connectors are supposed to be a standard, so if you're charging by a microUSB plug and it fries your device, it's because an engineer somewhere was more than likely TOLD to create a device with a different voltage rating SO that users would be punished for using 3rd party products.  I've got 5 useless data cables that don't work with my Samsung phone because they play games with pins and voltages just so you have to buy their specific cable even though it's billed as a USB connection. That's just bullshit. Industry Standard should mean Industry Standard.   You like baseball?     3     Oh very nice information. Thank you         Hey thanks, I am due to get a new batch of noopept in a month or so, and am checking out the site.   Thanks! I had a feeling those hairs were no touchy touchy. Next time, however, knowing how pretty the adult form is, I will make a greater effort to remove it from my house to a safe location rather than summary execution.  I've seen them around before and generally left them be because of their demonic appearance hahaha - I just couldn't have him where he was - about to crawl up under my couch in the corner and possibly re-emerge at some random time.      Awesome, thanks  I'll try the noopept sublingually, though I must admit - having seen a complainant about the taste of sulbutiamine below, which I don't mind the taste of - that I think noopept tastes like synthetic cat piss and despise the taste of it haha.   The noopept will turn you into a walking TI-83 if you're not careful. Hence MACA   Mood boost and more consistent energy levels as well as sex drive.   Actually u/MisterYouAreSoDumb had some good remarks here in the thread about why not to do it constantly and given the low up front efficacy I would tend to agree with their rationale.   I need a digi but not for vitamins haha.   I didn't like the taste until I realized how it made me feel. Now it just tastes like Vitamin to me   Oh thanks on that 5htp info.  Re: Noopept I disagree on the super stringent weight requirements. You take a double scoop of the 15 mg scoop they provide and it works wonders and I don't get side effects from it. I still cycle as directed.  Re: Sulbutiamine I agree on the use sparingly axiom. Every time I touch it I feel a good boost and then I leave it alone for weeks. Tolerance definitely was detected in early use. Now with occasional use I always feel a little boost and I feel on point.  But yes point taken on the 5-HTP. I'll back it off to a maintenance thing in case I roll, but I have noticed only long term effects from cessation like a dip in mood at the three week mark from stopping. Any comment on why it would take 3 weeks to do that? Generally while on it I do not notice any serious effect.    I wake up in the morning and drink about a pint of coffee from a french press, drink a Bolthouse Arabica Coffee Protein 30g, and then I take  * MACA 500mg, Ginseng 200mg * Gingko Biloba 120mg * Noopept 2-3 scoops ~30-45mg * Vitamin D^3 4000IUs * Magnesium Citrate 400mg * 5-HTP 50mg * Every week or two I take a fingerprint of Sulbutiamine powder under the tongue and let stand til it absorbs halfway then rinse with water. * Every week and a half or so I don't take the Noopept for a couple of days.

 Thanks! Built a Jhonny 5 before actually so I'll build on it.   Thanks for the assistance! I don't have tens of thousands and if I do, I'd spend it for sure :D UK robots are pretty lame, I'll go for the Japanese ones and will update here once I built it.       Works fine now I guess, can you try on your side?      Yea because Arduino.org is still manufacturing in Italy.   Yea but Arduino.org is still made in Italy, one of them will kill the other eventually.      Out of the room actually!      Thanks for sharing, I use Codebender.cc, it's an online IDE for all Arduino a-like platforms.      Totally agree, thanks for your feedback and i will pass it to them for sure :)   You're right some stuff about the campaign look fishy, i do know them personally though and they graduated from an accelerator called Buildit in Estonia.

 autocorrect ? Damnnit, no wonder Google failed me.     Yeah, the subs are the GC subs, not your folks.  You're hiring the GC, and that GC is choosing to farm out the work at their risk - and profit.   I  would complain to the GC and let him/her deal with the sub.     you get to have it not display your house number, but it will still display the street and your name.  The default is to display your full name with your full street address, and this is not made obvious before registering, nor are there privacy prompts when logging in.     IIRC mine has a toggle system.    yep.  not paying that.  ten bucks was cheap enough for me to try one out though.    yeah, it's a whole 'nother room.  Am I the only one who finds the attachment points a bit awkward though ?    Indian food *is love*.    Good Private. Carry on.    you can buy them at the station, but you run the risk of not being able to get a ticket for say the next train and may have to wait for a later one.  It's a very nice station however, basically an indoor shopping mall with a food court, interesting retail stores.     See fortunately I was able to remember enough about motorcycles to realize they don't require pedaling.     Definitely not.  The Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot are getting dated... we need something new, and that kid could be the one to "discover" it.    The cost of flying out is the cheap part.  It's the villa on the beach that gets you.   that's hardcore.  free soloing too ?    "Holy crap lookout ! Oh, it's animatronic.  I got this."   Found [this] (http://www.amputee-coalition.org/inmotion/may_jun_06/motorcycle.html).  Not end of world. A big change, sure.    shit, forgot they operate things with their feet.  I was thinking like a bicycle, just using it a mass for balance.  I bet there are prosthetics that operate clutches/gears just fine.   With my luck I'd have this great plan full of break even analysis that showed I should wait until I'm X years old to start taking my benefits, and then die at X-1.        or $50k on a new car every 5 Wow.  Doing this while in debt just strikes me as ... well, narcissistic.    Don't know a thing about motorcycles ... are legs so critical to riding that them losing a leg would be any worse than anyone else losing a leg? People do amazing things in prosthetics...   Such a shame.  At least on the bright side the world is closer to providing more autonomy in cars to help prevent accidents like that.    Wear lightweight breathable clothing, stick to the early mornings or evening (as opposed to mid-day) , be well hydrated.   also in bad weather I think it makes a lot of sense to keep it closer to home by doing many shorter loops or going back and forth on the trail versus  just like heading 3 miles out, 3 miles back.  That way if you do hurt yourself or have heat problems you're never too far from home.    ah  yes, thanks  for the reminder about reservations.  Greenbelt park is *national* ?  I would have never suspected.    That's a shame.  I wonder if  she somehow got the gas pedal stuck ? Or if she was going a normal slow speed and just didn't turn in time ?  it looks like the rebar just pulled clean out of the cement....I would hope it would take quite an effort to make that happen.   mine wasn't cheap, and they told me straight off they don't repair/replace/anything poles and sent me to that third  party one.   I was thinking Patapsco if he called a Friday evening and said "I have 18 hours free, lets camp tonight".   Otherwise definitely Thurmont is about the closest I'd start with.   You're right, the towpath is awesome intro backpacking; straight flat mileage.... it's a rarity around here.  In fact, I may head there for my next one just to be able to clock miles without worrying about busting an ankle.   That's a shame, 22 years old.     [Here's another article with more details.] (http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/big-daddy-ice-cream-man-killed-kids-watch-maryland-article-1.2258024)   Those are aluminum stays and most likely are intended to be bent to custom fit your back.  It's one of the things I love about my old Kelty SlickRock.   Just go online, give Kelty a ring and ask them.  You'll have no problem; if it isn't meant to be bent to shape I'm sure they'll just mail you a new one or let you buy one cheap.  Congrats on the great find and have fun !    [I think this pretty much says it all ] (http://www.reddit.com/r/CampingandHiking/comments/38wqfw/ok_be_honest_how_many_folks_have_watched_netflix/)   I think the point behind the snarky stylism is that you shouldn't get your n00b experience on a difficult trail in a difficult park. I guess.    Lol.  Probably right.  People would be like "yeah, that guy wasn't bad, knew all the words".     I can't tell either, but just the words "raw meat was a few days old ...then saw this" was creepy enough for me.   Relevant : [Look what just hit the front page] (http://phys.org/news/2015-06-france-sale-monsanto-herbicide-roundup.html)    well it is a *service* camp, not vacation.      but completely bearable "outdoors" smell with a hint of active human underneath.   Exactly. It's like the smells hit an equilibrium and go "ok, this is good, lets stop here"    [Not the worse] (http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary orgid=8032#.VX4kTkbeqGY) I've seen, but you're right - you need to investigate the non-profs and "charitable"orgs without assuming they're actually altruistic.       presuming sharpie is for writing pertinent data on your forehead (ok, forearm) and circling and timing inflammation ?    LoL. OP is being lured into a chemical labor camp.    bummer.  I appreciate the education.    Every store bought first-aid kit I've ever seen has been an overpriced glorified assortment of band aids and analgesics.     Unless you run just an insanely minimalist household and really can't stand the idea of having some commonly used first aid stuff leftover (which my family goes through constantly anyhow) than you can just go to walmart, buy a variety of bandaids, some gauze (2x2's as well as one or two 4x4s is useful), some ointment, some aspirin, ace wrap etc.  Throw it all into a small tupperware or empty food container (my current "medium" kit is in a plastic peanut butter jar and I love it).  And you'll probably actually *still* save money the first time.   Also, it appears that [snake bit kits] (http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124208165196508345)aren't [particularly useful](http://tucsonlocalmedia.com/news/article_bb20d85c-d71d-11e4-8ceb-6fcca8f1d7ec.html).   I know I stopped carrying one years and years ago.  I tried it on a bunch of mosquito bites once (Extractor bills it as helping with that too), didn't do a damn thing.    If you're in SW Virginia you're in the best area of the entire Maryland/Va region IMO.  You've got SNP, Mongahela, the GW,Daniel Boone ...  the Jeff goes right through Roanoke and Blacksburg into Kentucky and Tennesee.   Here's what you do:   - Open Google Maps.  Find your home.  - Look for big green blotches near you and zoom in.  - If it has "National Forest" in the name, that's what you want.   - Google that shit.  - Find pictures, descriptions, blog postings. - Call the Ranger district and learn more.       So even though my shed has multiple windows that keeps it ventilated and reasonably cool (certainly not over a hundred unless the ambient is) I still really should keep my tents in it ?    Jealous.    Keep in mind - *everyone* out there with you  will be as dirty and nasty and grimy as you feel but it's not really all that bad, don't be self-conscious.  Here are some tips I've picked  up over the years...   - Baby wipes are your best friends.  They're a wet nap after eating, they're great for you know what of course, but you can also feel really clean just by using them to wipe down all over in the morning.  No of course it's not the same as hot shower, but you really do feel a lot better.   You pretty much can't bring too many especially as a n00b.   I've used them clean wounds, clean pots, clean my ears out... they're the leatherman of field hygiene.  - I really like to take acne wipes with to clean my face on a regular basis.  I got into this habit when being in the woods meant wearing camouflage, which meant acne ... but I noticed over the years that if I keep my face clean I feel better  even if the rest of me is grimy.   - Baby powder, or some variation. Some people like actual plain baby powder, other people like foot powder (which is basically baby powder that may have a hint of antifungal in it), "monkey butt" powder ... but baby powder helps quite a bit with cutting back on irritation and the general nasty feeling.  If you're logging high miles with weight it's considered a must-have for foot maintenance (keep your feet dry, clean and powdered) but after taking a baby wipe "bath" it's nice to be able to powder your "nose" (not actually your nose).    - If you take a bandana or other cloth and a little bit of concetrated soap (Like Dr Brommers) then heating up some water and at least giving your face and upper body a good scrub can really help.    - if you're used to shaving every day, then shaving in the feel will help keep you feeling right.  Just heat up some water in your canteen cup, and give it a go.  Use a signal mirror or ask your bud if you missed  any spots. Or if you can spare  the weight bring an electric razor.  - For short haired folks get a fresh short hair cut as others have mentioned.   This will help you feel cleaner, *and* cooler, and help prevent tick and other problems.  With short hair, just wiping a baby wipe over your head or a hot warm cloth can make it feel like you shampooed.   - For folks with long hair, There's "dry" shampoo that doesn't require any water...  I haven't used it myself, but I read a review somewhere that said it really does help.  Wouldn't know, never had long hair.   - Brush yer teeth at least a couple times a day.   - Your deodorant has now power in the woods.  I don't even bother.   - Change your socks frequently.  Even if I don't bring a change of clothing on a trip, I'll absolutely bring at least an extra pair of socks with me.   When hiking long distances foot care is essential, but even if you aren't hiking much you want to change your socks at least every day to let them air out and dry (and prevent any athletes  foot issues).  When you don't need to be wearing them, take off your boots.   Bring sine shower shoes or something to kick around camp with; that will let your boots, feet and socks air and dry at once.     - And saving the best for last: Your Underwear Counts. You know how everyone says "don't wear cotton outdoors" ? You know, cause it soaks  up moisture like rain and sweat and takes forever to release it ? Yeah .... cotton underwear does that too and at least me, it drives me absolutely crazy.   Go find yourself some synthetic "wicking" undies; you'll be much cooler and feel so much better.   Good luck, enjoy the camp.    damn dude.    yeah, tents kind of suck; they can be really expensive and it seems no manufacturers bother stocking repair parts, and tent pole damage isn't exactly extremely rare.   There's one or two companies online that make it a point to stock all sorts of tent pole parts and poles ... don't remember the name but they google up ok.  Or call your local REI - they recommend one of the companies to folks.    Hah - those remind me of those old wax lip candies.    I took Greyhound once.  Once.  I remember it as being pretty stark.   No, but they're probably a common return.  My ticket was labelled with the return complaint as "bowl bends".  Well look, it takes about 2 seconds holding it to realize it's  very thing and yes, will dent...I suspect they get returned out of buyer's remorse.  I mean honestly, there's no way I'd pay msrp for them.    I don't know where the buses pull in, but bus stations are attractive  targets overseas, so I would guess that thing has more cameras on it than Times Square.    By the way, it's not *cinema* but Toby's Dinner Theater is a longstanding Columbia attraction.   isn't it about time this video move to Facebook so those folks can all think it's new ?    I think it's worth pointing out however that the BD poles are several multiples the price of the walmart ones.     Usually they'll come with two bags: a smaller waterproof stuff back for when actually packing it, and then a larger trashbag sized ventilated bag for storage.  You want to let them fluff out and get plenty of ventilation during storage.     Target sells cheap Champion brand wicking gear that works great.    Wallet - what's wrong with a ziplock ?    Great thread idea !!  I LOVE Tabasco, and until I [figured out to make my own packet sized storage] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/39ll3j/contact_rewetting_drop_bottles_are_often_reusable/) I would grab those packets of Pete's from ChickFila.   Nope, never encountered any of those "rules" in the Infantry.    It's nice research though, not that I need any convincing to lighten my load.    may want to see if there's a sub for your town, and just put a note there.    it's the starting point for hiking the Maryland section of the AT southbound.  The park sits in the Md-PA line.  Harpers Ferry is the other end.  The Maryland section is popular because it's only around 41 miles and doable in a long weekend.    wow dude that sucks.  I guess the driver doesn't even check tags or anything ... think it would be worth trying to file a claim with Greyhound ?   Hope things get better.    That is correct.  When white people get exposed to too much sun their skin cells are basically mildly cooking.  That's why it go through different colors - first a light pink, then a dark red and then brown just like cooking a steak.   If you get too much sun, it does burn and hurt like a rope burn.  If we burn too much though you can fortunately just scrape off the burnt skin with the back of a butter knife and bring us back to just toasted again.   Of course some people think that white people do have melanin in their skins, just less of it.  I find that a little hard to believe though.   Source: am white person, spend time in son.   multiday patrol in a hot as balls jungle down south.  not really sure why they had us bring so much.      not sure why I didn't think of that ... looks like i'm not the only one intent on using it as a pot.   nah, no need, this will work quite fine and I'm just not going to buy full retail for titanium, it's just not worth it to me.    So according to [this ] (http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs30.htm) it looks like if you may more than 217 dollar a week after taxes, they can garnish 25% of any amount over that.   They seem to keep 217 as week as like a minimal survival income.   The rules get different for special situations like child support or tax collections.  You just know that tax collection's gonna have it's own rules- the Man always get paid.   Remember that the 25% is of the "disposable" income. THEY don't refer to disosable as what's left over after you pay your bills (like most people); they call it whatever's left over after taxes and a few other things.  Their concept of 'disposable' doesn't even include health insurance apparently.   So their concept of what's disposable and subject to garnishment is probably going to  be pretty different from yours.    I presume that's frozen or previously frozen ?    Thanks- I'll have to make a side trip someday and check them out.    pork for 80 cents ? WOW, that's super cheap.   You're  lucky to find chicken thighs on sale for 99 cents around here.    I betcha that dude catches a beat down before police are called..   it doesn't fit over my colander !    correct.  it's a snowpeak trek bowl ... and it's actually very much pot sized and shaped - the wall just flare out a bit and aren't perfectly vertical.  There's no handle, but I have that covered with the litte gsi silicon grippy, and there's no lid but I don't see a reason I can't just form a foil one.    Maryland.  Yeah, I'd reckon it would be cheaper in Texas ... kind of like brisket central down there.    I think you're doing the right thing.  The best smoker is the one *he'll use*.   True q is a labor of love. Lazy q isn't as good IMO ( i have both a sidebox smoker as well as an expensive electric) but it's many many times easier and  more convenient, and i've  absolutely used it several times when otherwise I wouldn't have smoked at all.   Hit Costco this morning, was going to get some cheap brisket but it was 9 dollars a pound. I can get top quality fresh steaks for that price.    Is brisket suddenly fashionable or something ?  It's supposed to be a lousy cut only suitable for slow roasts and smoking right ?    hit costco this morning, picked up some back ribs.  we'll see how that goes.   that sounds awesome, completely ignoring nutrition, but at what point do you stop calling it "pizza" and start calling it "food served on a cheese and bread plate" ?    Picked up a titanium bowl at a garage sale.  Honestly just bought it because it was a reasonable price, and now I'm the beaming proud owner of a new titanium bowl .... so .... now what ?   I don't take bowls or plates with me on overnights, I just take a single GSI pot that has little grippers and a cozie.  I boil and eat/drink out of it.   So I'm already good to go with using a single item for everything.  I can use the little gsi grippers to move the titanium bowl on/off the fire, no problem. To help boil times I can just make an aluminum foil lid, no problem.   But what about drinking hot stuff from it? I wonder if the titanium will cool faster than the contents, so I could basically let everything cool down to a reasonable temperature and then grip it without a cozie.  I only "boil" to help things cook; I certainly don't need (or want !) my food or coffee literally boiling hot.  And, since I plan on coupling this with an alcohol stove, I don't think the contents will get insanely hot in the first place.  Any advice ? Or maybe just keep using my existing cook set now with the benefit of a bowl for essentially zero weight penalty ?    I would use a storage bag like [this one] (http://www.rei.com/product/733948/msr-dromedary-bag-10-liter#tab-specs) and strap it to the outside top of my pack, under the hood, like a rope.  That will keep it along your back and up nice and high, and by cinching the hood on it you'll be able to minimize sloshing and slinging.   Beware that each gallon of water weighs 8 pounds.   I've carried 4 gallons before plus a combat load - that much water will absolutely wear on you... so as others have suggested unless you're going into an arid region I would seek beta on resupply and filtering instead of humping all that water in.      Just bought a mini.  Trying to squeeze short multidays from a 52l to a 36l bag, and the old Pur Scout is just looking a little too big for solo use.    I grabbed a snowpeak titanium bowl with the label still in it for 10 bucks because whoever douche bought it, dented it up, and then returned it as "bowl gets dents".    yeah, I know at one point I was able to drink and not smoke.  But apparently I couldn't drink and *be* around smokers; the combination was just too much and that's how I fell off the wagon... just 1 at a happy hour.   Well, as the song goes ... one thing leads to another.   But I did not go out last night, I did not smoke.     it's surprising that in today's world of connected cameras everything this can happen.     aw geez, rt 1 is terrible everywhere.  But on the turnpike folk seem to be very good about  signalling, passing, signalling moving back over.  The lower states could learn something from that for sure.   thanks. I did not smoke last night ;)  I stayed home, hydrated like a mug then went to bed.  I'm glad I did.   hah !  Yes, that's a good idea then ;)   My tent has a little mesh pocket on the top that's perfect for stashing my glasses, because when I wake  up they're literally right in front of my face !    that's a first.  What'd you tell 'em ?  "No, just me and my sedan." ?     But I know where that would probably lead so here I am on a Friday night all pumped up looking to have fun and sitting on a fucking computer for fucks sake.     I may go anyhow.     crazy isn't it ? bet they smell like shit too eh   You didn't "fail as a mother" today.   You lost your temper.  It happens. When we were kids it usually resulted in a belt or a stick. In the army it would result in a beat down.   You screamed, and you shook.     Shake it off, learn from it, try to do better next time.  You didn't fail as a mother.  Jeez.  You have no idea how many truly horrific monster  parents there are.     oh, it can be much longer than that. some folks never get off that sweet, sweet credit and stay hooked on it their entire lives.    on that note, is it then bad to supplement with isolate ? there are days when I don't eat but i'll still grab a couple scoops of protein - guess that's not the way to do it ?    oh yeah, sure, I meant safe from thievery.  although racoons are some pretty crafty thieving little bastards.    I'm *not* crazy?!?  Thank you !    It's definitely a marathon. I don't know where you started off but 148 at 5'6 seems pretty good man.  Don't develop and eating disorder !  Sounds like you're meal planning and prepping so you have really consistent diet - maybe you should ask over in /r/nutrition if it's adequate ?    I'm hooked on both too.  When the weather sucked and I ran indoors exclusively I'd start off with a treadmill 5k, then power lifting.  Squats after running can be rough, but it really, really helped my n00b running and kept everything on the same recovery cycle.   It's a bit trickier since I've been running outdoors... I suppose I *could* run outdoors then go to the gym, but honestly by the time I'd get there I'd be cooled off all over again and lost all the adrenaline, so I stagger the days instead.  It's been good so far, but I find that I'm not really hitting legs as much as I used to, because I wouldn't really have a recovery period for them if Im running the next day.      Whats your diet like ? Are you doing 2k calories like all protein, or are you getting plenty of carbohydrates as well ?    Was it in Brazil ? It only seems satisfying when it's Brazil.   I was gonna say Bethesda Cinema and Drafthouse but ....another long lived treasure gone.    I'm gangstah.  I've been known to put my trash out as early as 2pm on Sunday.

What do you want ?    "Enter Fort Bragg a young man, leave an old man".    yeah, for real.  I mean the Infantry is just retarded compared to backpackers.  Can you imagine going backpacking with spare boots ?   Someday I want to hit the Appalachian Trail with PRC77 and a baseplate. Just go full retard with it.     I'm curious about Nextdoor.com, but you can't tell a thing about the site without registering, and they want real names.    Does anyone use it ? Anything you can tell me about it ? From the little information I've been able to google it seems like it's mostly just message board groups based on geographical proximity.  Thanks.     I'm a long time resident, I'm opposed to a lot of the new changes and development, and strictly adhere to the suburban idylics, but I too live in Wilde Lake and I'm hear to tell you it Was.Not.That.Loud.    I've been hearing Merriweather in my back since when they still hosted good bands (ha ! take that youngsters  !) and I remember that Sunday clearly, being outside with a buddy drinking beer; we both noted it was louder than usual, tried to guess the band, and went about your drinking.  It was slightly louder.    I'm pretty much as old-man curmudgeonly as it gets, and it didn't put me off.  That article was just full of hyperbole.    So it this guy mostly hitting parking lots like apartments and condos ?    just be very careful with rubbing compound.  it's very easy to over do it with.    why would  you assume I know more than you ?  if your meat is coming out too smokey or if it's coming out too charred or you get the creosote build up (that's the nasty black char) than one thing you can try is wrapping it in foil; let's it heat without absorbing the smoke.   I'm pretty far from the city but I just wanted to say that I think what you're doing  is great and wish you good luck.   	113
                   Intensive potty training through ABA worked for us. It was a week long of prompting child to drink liquids so they felt the urge to use the restrooms. You need a motivator of course that will act as a reward. You start in the Restroom and as they use it in succession they receive their reward ie...  IPad, toy, snack, it can be anything. After a few successes you move closer out of the restroom and eventually you repeat this throughout the entire house. It was intense and you spend a whole week doing this from 9 am until bedtime, it was really tough but rewarding. My child now goes to the rest room without prompts and wears underwear without issues. I definitely recommend looking into this.

This top secret Cold War research program initially looked for ways to defend against a chemical or biological attack by the Soviet Union, thought to be far ahead of the United States in "psycho-chemical" warfare. But the research expanded into offensive chemical weapons, including one that could, according to one Army film obtained by CNN, deliver a "veritable chemical ambush" against an enemy.

I particularly like the quality, you can even see who is sitting in the nosebleeds.            Someone else would have six rings.    No, same principle the Lakers tried with Hall of Famers.

It's in the wall already with a plate but doesnt work. There's no wired network.    Yes. There is no router or modem in the junction box so my Internet is wireless. What hardware would I need to connect in the junction box to be able to make a wired network, I have a good 4 to 6 cable running to the junction box.    My router is in office in the house.  The junction point with all the cables are in the garage.       Here is my current set up - Our house came pre-installed with cat-5e in 4 rooms all going down to the garage in a central panel.  - Our Internet connection comes through a coax cable to a cable modem located in living room.   - One wireless router connects to the cable modem for my home to share our internet connection within our home. So I'm not using the wired networking in my home today, and I would like to change that.  - What piece of hardware would I need to buy?   I would like to connect my fire TV to the network as I get a lot of buffering but don't want to put modem or router in garage because of heat/cold/humidity.   Here's a picture of where the cables lead into the garage. http://imgur.com/B7AxmEz   Did your setup not workout? https://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/3aafhv/our_first_home_theater_diy_link_in_comments/      /u/trollabot sn17                                             Does anyone have the CNBC documentary "dishonesty Scandal in the NBA".

 And no matter how much you've read up on the game or seen the videos, nothing really prepares you for playing it yourself.   I got to play the 3rd one thru night 5 with no information.  That was special.  However I will never forget the first time I played FNAF 1.  I had heard about it online but wanted to give it a shot.  I got my siblings and cousins together, who had never heard of it, and sat them in the basement watching me on the iPad.  We all screamed and jumped when Bonny showed up at the door for the first time.    Over the next few days we took turns playing to see if we could make it through to night 5.  I think we got to 4.  Anyway play it with friends, makes it more fun and less scary!  Also you can turn the sound down when you don't want the jumpscares to be so intense.   Yeah, dangit.  I'm 20.  Although I didn't realize most of the people on here are younger than me   The eyes are so wierd, how does Chica have narrower eyes in some pictures and wider eyes in others?  The eyeball isn't being covered up, it seems to be changing size itself.  Anyway some more things to look into:  - flashing Freddy eyes (morse code/binary?)  - Animatronic glitch timing (morse code/binary?)  - the static between games  - Weird static/distortion that follows you when you turn your head in the office - watch the pixels on the desk  Keep up the good work      Hey can someone check the flickering light of Freddy's eyes?  It might be morse code or binary or something.   I didn't grow up with a console, but I played a lot of PC games like Backyard Baseball, Backyard Skateboarding, Locomotion, RCT, and I Spy Treasure Hunt.  Always feels good to go back to those   My sister and I loved the DS version of Yoshi's Island!  I will have to try the original now.  Also that gaming conference looks like a lot of fun.   I love this type of documentary, does anybody have any more that are about the beginning of roller coasters?   Mario Kart (Double Dash, DS and Wii U) Five Nights at Freddy's (all 3 but 1 is the best) Canvas Rider (free online) Retry (iPhone) Super Mario Galaxy 2  Basically anything simple a kid could play but it has that extra challenge if you want it    The one muffin says to the other one, "Woah, a silent muffin!"   I wrote a paper this semester on Five Nights at Freddy's, no regrets   Either side in the back is great   Nobody could reproduce, because there would only be one sex   Posting on a social media account that is not yours   Nice   Thought you guys might like this!  I'm a junior (third year) at college and I wrote my analysis paper on Five Nights at Freddy's.  My teacher said she never had a student include a video game as a source before but for some reason she let me do it.  If you're going to read it I have to add that the college is a private Christian school so naturally there's several biblical allusions.  Also, it's not perfect and there are some mistakes.  Here's a link: http://www.docdroid.net/10rk1/fnaf-paper.pdf.html  Student Readers Summary:  In the original order, man is above all creation but falls short of divinity.  Frankenstein portrays a terrifying farce in which this order is disrupted and man creates new life.  5.N.A.F. tells a similar story in which robots are animated via dead children.  Both stories horrify because even the most successful attempts at creating life fall terribly short, and offend the humanity of the audiences.  We are not the sources of life, and in fact need God to supply our own life.    TL;DR:  Humans are incapable of creating anything greater than or equal to themselves, and any living thing created solely with human hands is doomed to be a monster.   Reminds me of the Cyclone at Lakeside!   I want to get off Mr. Bones' Wild Ride   Jupiter is EA main server  Got it   I love that one      Agreed!

It can be frustrating at times but it's rewarding in the end.   I like to make other people laugh but when someone else makes a joke, they all turn and look at me and wait for me to laugh.  I rarely laugh unless something is totally random or unexpected.         Die Coasters are fairly uncommon for obvious reasons   Hey guys!  Foxy is a good guy!

  aspartame tastes like complete hot ass  Unless you're into that.    I mean, this is a book where the main character has to come up with a name for an energy measurement and he chooses "pirate ninjas."  Please tell me you're joking...   Take a deep knee bend buddy. Not judging the book, simply stating that A realistic portrayal of how science is done is not enough to make something entertaining.    Yeah, fuck people for liking a semi-realistic portrayal of how science is done  That's doesn't make something a good novel, though.  A peer reviewed journal article is a realistic portrayal of how science is done, but that doesn't make it entertaining.  I think the point was you need *more* that just realistic science.   Research says that's what the vast majority of people want.   I haven't read the book, but people in the thread indicate that that line is entirely in keeping with Damon's character.      Why did you ask for advice if you've already decided everything about the strength of your case?      No, they think the specific phrase "freedom of speech" refers to its use in the 1st Amendment.    The vast majority of Americans understand "freedom of speech" to refer to the protections offered in the first amendment.       Sorry, I missed those ones.  I'll delete this.  Thanks!    I was thinking of filing a motion to dismiss based on the fact that I was allowed to be at the premises  You were not arrested for trespassing, you were arrested to entering a crime scene.  It doesn't matter if you had permission, the cops don't let people enter a crime scene where they could potentially contaminate it.   The fact that so many people in that thread are bending over backwards to defend a guy overreacting should make clear to anyone how the general population of reddit feels about women.   I don't know anyone with that mindset. It's strange that someone would come to a party brining their own beer for only them to drink. I've just never encountered it.    Mmmmmm I just took another bite.  Still delicious.   I'm enjoying this back and forth while eating a delicious bacon cheeseburger.  No regrets.   110 is ridiculously fast.  At that speed you're unlikely to get much of a deal from the prosecutor.  Maybe they'd drop the license plate ticket.  You're looking at several points on your license and a possible suspension depending on how angry the judge is at you and your driving history.  A lawyer will probably cost between 500-1000.   Yooooooooo   Other people breaking the law does not allow you to do so.    Nothing.  He wants to know if he can break the lease for this.   I was hoping this would be grounds for me to break my contract and leave earlier.  Almost certainly not.  Your landlord has no responsibility for or control over the actions of the police.   Parents make permanent medical decisions for their children all the time.     you don't mind at all that the irreversible procedure was done without your consent? That you never got the choice?  Could not care less.   Your insurance company will appoint an attorney to defend you in this case.    Hortense.    Thanks.  [We're in the third circuit and that seems to be the rule here.](http://www.trenklawfirm.com/publications/tuition_debt_is_dischargeable.pdf)   I've had unpaid tuition discharged in bankruptcy without issue in the past.   Doesn't that teach them to blindly obey authority? They're still not convinced. Your explanation changed nothing. They're still doing what your said only because you're the one who said it.    You should never blindly obey anyone or anything. Ever.  That's kind of silly. Your first day on the job you don't know if your boss ip has any idea what he's doing. You still listen when he gives direction.    If I sell urine to someone and I don't sell it for a direct purpose, I don't believe I can be held liable.  Buncha lawyers just told you you're wrong.  But I bet you know better, right?    If I sell you matches and you light a house on fire, am I liable?  Yeah, you're selling it to help people beat drug tests, and you're going to get caught and punished for it.  You're trying to super duper clever here, and no one is buying it, and neither would the police, the prosecutor, the judge, or the jury.   *The legality depends on the purpose.*   Agreed good sir!   I like to think we're all a subhuman pos upvotes or no.      This guy   The lawyer cannot sue the insurance company because they are not a party. His girlfriend would still be sued and the insurance company pays.    Is this a real question? Of course they do.       No, it isn't, and that case has no applicability here. See /u/thepatman comment.    You're right, I'm a dope, carry on!   Need to np. that link OP.   It might be a good idea to call your bar association, give them the details, and ask them for a recommendation.  They may know an attorney that specializes in this type of work.   Your main concern should not be legal issues but administrative ones.    could a person expect trouble if they warned someone on the street not to answer police questions?  Yes, it's very possible that you would be interfering with a police investigation.  You know little or nothing about a situation you happen upon while walking down the street.  The person could be a witness, a victim, or an old friend of the officer stopping to chat.  It's inappropriate to stick your nose in without knowing the circumstances, and especially without any legal training.   So as the title says, I've been to three lawyers and most have come across as telling me it wasn't worth it or to just chalk it up as a life lesson. One told me I'd be lucky if I got close to half back (after legal fees). I refuse to believe that.  If three lawyers have all told you the same thing you should probably believe them.  If three doctors told you to take a certain medicine you'd be crazy to go on WebMD and do something different.  In any case no one here can review your paperwork, which would create an attorney client relationship.    Are you also a lawyer?  Clearly not.   Is this the right thing to do?  No.    As far as I know, if you're legally married, you are not required to testify against your spouse and can plead the 5th.  Again, you're completely wrong regarding the 5th Amendment.  Calling the cops on your spouse is pretty morally fucked up  Nah, abusing your spouse is morally fucked up and someone being abused should absolutely call the police.  Tell them you refuse to testify against your wife.  This is contempt.  At least you are learning a valuable lesson about the realities of the Justice system here.  Your multiple misstatements of fact and law show that you have no clue how the justice system works.    don't you have Fifth Ammendment rights with regard to testifying against a spouse  No, the Fifth Amendment has nothing to do with testifying against a spouse.  why not tell the prosecutor that he isn't going to answer any questions  That's contempt.  Besides maybe an afternoon in jail on a contempt charge won't be so bad..  You're held until you agree to testify.   I suppose it's possible that the woman hired would be unable to complete an essential job function. The employer could fire her, reduce her pay, promote her, or transfer her. There's no law that says anything MUST be done in that situation.    I don't understand your question.    No there is no law that says if an employee is physically stronger they must be paid more than other employees, even if the employer doesn't do a strength test on their bus personnel.    If they're too heavy for anyone else to carry your boss says you need to carry it. There's no law that says you must be paid more for this.    This is not discrimination.     I should just allow them to fuck up my future just because of my ingenuity?  YOU fucked up your future.  Take some responsibility for your own actions.     her explanation introduces doubt as to whether or not she means what she is saying.  Not every doubt is a *reasonable* doubt.   I see at least $10 in compensatory and $1,000,000 in punitives here.       Except that I cannot sue when my order is wrong.  I'll take that case pro bono for you!   I've taken and settled cases like this. More than one. McDonalds didn't get your order right? Of course no emotional damages. You got sexually assaulted? The guy admitted it? And you got jerked around in the other avenues you tried? You're damn right you can recover for this.    Physical and emotional damages. If you don't think being sexually assaulted is a case for emotional damages you're nuts.     I did not feel she has a civil case.  It's astounding to me that you feel someone that is raped has no civil recourse.    I like you most of the time, but this is a stupid comment. Our course you can sue civilly for rape. It's sexual assault. Just like you can sue if someone punches you in the head.   Some guy in Europe made his country.         It does make you their client though, meaning that they must act in your best interest on this matter.  There is no requirement for money to change hands to become a client.   It's actually not like that at all.  There is no requirement whatsoever that money change hands to create an attorney client relationship.  That scene, while cool, has no basis in reality.   They can charge him at any time up to the statute of limitations, which is measured in years, not months.  This is perfectly legal.   Likely yes.    k   You have to understand that lawyers make money by charging clients. There not really any resource for free legal advice even if you only want one question answered. If you want this done right you need to pay a local attorney for an hour of their time.    Because I prefer the look and feel of soft hairless skin. Not because I prefer my women to be subjugated.    Bullshit. Whether or not the standard is sexist in its origin does not somehow make me wrong for preferring that today. It's astounding to say "hey there's nothing wrong with preferences but your preferences are wrong. Change them."   I dunno.  I've been with my wife for over 10 years.  I know what she likes and I play to that to make her happy.  She does the same thing.  She likes my head shaved.  It wouldn't be my first choice, but it makes her really happy, so, why not?  She's not a big fan of high heels, but on the once or twice a month we get a chance for date night she wears them because she knows I like it.  I think the quote takes it way too far, in that it's an order, but you can absolutely make changes and compromises and still have a happy relationship.  	75
 SD card was taken from Grizzly shit. OP is the park ranger.    Basically Souvlakistan lost total autonomy and are now Europe's prison bitch.    Ah,  another 80+ billion gone that we will NEVER get back and Souvlakistan can burn a bit longer.    You might want to take a course in comprehensive reading, because I have been quite clear.   It's not up to you to decide they opinions are reprehensible. Who made you a god? It may be your opinion that their beliefs are reprehensible, but that doesn't automatically make it so.  Stop thinking the world revolves around you.   It's not up to me to decide if her statement is fine, neither is it for me to give judgement on her saying it. Do I agree with her? I don't think so, but that goes into a deeper conviction that marriage is an old fashioned concept regardless of gender.   Oh obviously it would bother me, however I would still defend her right to say so.  However if she was actively firing up the oven, that quite a different story.  Voltaire had something nice to say on this   I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it.    Thank you! You have a great day as well, friend.   We tip the paperboy at Xmas. Usually about 20-50 euros. Depends a bit on how the service was. This year so far he's getting the 50 euro tip. I got a morning paper,  and without fail,  it's there before I wake up, which is pretty early.    No no. It might be your opinion that she is for lack of better words, a prejudiced asshole. Doesn't automatically make her one because her believe are not in line with yours.   Good on you mate!   [Whoohoo I won another argument on the internet.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law)   I agree in the sense that I believe marriage is an outdated system that should be made completely equal to a civil union (same rights and plights). It's just a word that is causing a ton of crap. Let whoever wants to call it a marriage call it a marriage and whoever wants to call it a civil union a civil union. Most issues solved, Christians happy, homos happy.   Great "counter" there, buddy.   I'm not a fan of whiskey and cigars. But I'm sure my Gin and hooker  budget exceeds yours.   No, no I wouldn't.    Social Justice Warriors are a cancer that will ruin all progress made in the past 100 years.   Who says it's the right thing to do? It's a matter of opinion. In her believe system it is not the right thing to do. Perhaps you should respect her beliefs.   I would say the say the same as I am a proponent of free speech. Merkel could say the moon was made of cheese. It would make her look like an idiot, but she could say it none the less.   Nope.    Sure it will last you. However I have a nice looking kitchen and want a nice looking trashcan in it. I spend 20K euros on remodeling my kitchen,  do you think I would even hesitate at spending some cash on a nice bin instead of having some shitty disposable bin?    Absolutely right. If you think Merkel is a bigot,  feel free to express it.    That's fine. Whatever consequences follow from expressing your opinion are your own to deal with. You're still free to express your opinion.    Let's all not vote CDU,  wanna bet we van vote for who is Chancellor ;)    It's your right to say it. Whatever consequences follow from saying that are your own responsibilities.    And Merkel doesn't?  I guess being the single most powerful woman on this planet is not a powerful and influential political position.    It's your right to disagree. Doesn't mean you are right though.    And that is their prerogative. Luckily Germany is a democratic country and they can tell her next election.    LOL   Society will judge them. They are still free to say it.    I'm voting for her.   Nope. It would make me think less of them,  but I'll be the last to care what they say. Society as a whole will judge them accordingly.    Quite the opposite,  but also not a fascist telling people what they can and cannot say.    Najib pretty much told me to shove it when I missed a deal. Either I got unlucky,  or you got lucky.    She's a human being entitled to her opinion whichever that opinion is. If the German people don't like it she'll be a goner by the next election.   My guess: we do not care.    Remember,  up and down votes on reddit mean nothing. Just voice your opinion in a polite way.    We're pretty sick of having our benefits being reduced year over year while we have to keep bailing out a corrupt and lying nation.    Almost 15% now.    Fortunately your opinion doesn't really matter.    Still ridiculous pricing. Got a 90 Oz tub of certified organic coconut oil for 18$ here. Restaurant supply store.    Just because you don't agree with it doesn't mean she is wrong or cannot say it. Two sides of a coin remember.    I'm not too fizzed about it. She said this on her personal conviction. There is nothing wrong with someone saying they believe that a marriage is between a man and a woman.    Maynard James Keenan. After dropping LSD.   No Walmart in Germany. I live in Germany.

 If there aren't many longitudinal studies, how do people develop informed opinions?   If men are going to start wearing skirts, they will need to learn about the magical world of thermal tights               I had a 'friend' like that at uni - we came to the conclusion that she probably has [histrionic personality disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histrionic_personality_disorder)         That's interesting - the author sees it as a really bad thing.

There's a commercial/concept video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtRz6UBLNrk)                  Most people regard ending ageing to be akin to magic - it's never taught as a possibility in schools, and has not entered mainstream consciousness as a viable idea. Because of this it's not widely discussed in mainstream media, and so most people never get the chance to hear about anything related to sens, let alone the organisation itself.

These days both countries have some great beers, but they don't tend to get exported   I think the biggest problem is that most countries are governed by politicians who change after quite a small period of time, so stuff like this usually isn't worth making a big deal of yet, because the effects will mostly be felt after they are out of office.

 Kudos to CJR for getting this important story out.    Idle Time Books, 18th near Columbia in Adams Morgan, has a large selection.    Family of Metro Smoke Incident Victim Raising Funds For Funeral Expenses http://dcist.com/2015/01/family_of_metro_smoke_incident_vict.php   unsuck dc metro has had a great second life on facebook and twitter: https://twitter.com/unsuckdcmetro  Big following and people use it as a kind of universal hashtag.    Screw all the keyboard tough guys who are trying to shame publications into publishing stuff they wouldn't have published anyway.   It seems like a lot of reporters around the world have been killed or have put themselves in gravel peril trying to get the truth out. They and their publications don't have to prove a damn thing.        As others have already pointed out: Georgetown Running Co. and Fleet Feet in Adams Morgan. I've bought shoes at both. Staff were very helpful.   I don't get knotted up about prices. Once I started buying good, well fitting shoes, and not the $60 specials, my experience with injuries declined. .    You have a great plan. Mandarin is impressive and it should open doors.   A college newspaper can open doors. It's amazing how many alumni will filter into newsrooms. They will become your first professional network.   A college paper is a great way to get a taste for working in a collaborative atmosphere. Some of the people I met through my college newspaper have been friends for life, so there is that, too.     Curious: Do you use a keyboard?    have your packages delivered to a third party service, like basecampdc.com   This sub has been good at bringing together the major headlines and studies, and I check it fairly regularly.   Yeah, the conversation is a little lacking. But I suspect if the conversation does pick up, the deniers will be the most aggressive and will be challenging everyone with "show me the studies," crap, just to troll away, and then when that happens, discussion will die down to where it now is.    This blog http://homicidewatch.org/  is a good example. The person who founded it won a Neiman http://nieman.harvard.edu/news/2014/09/laura-amico-nf-13-joins-boston-globe/  the point being is this blogger turned out something useful, targeted and focus, but most importantly, it seemed to me, it had a very clear mission.   Newspapers don't cover local stuff very much anymore. This fellow http://shortarticlesaboutlongmeetings.blogspot.com/ covers local Neighborhood Advisory Commission meetings (ANC) in DC. Don't know him or his plans, but he turns out solid news reports on these meetings, and his work has been gaining readers.   Arlington Now was nothing but one guy. The blog is not very old, but he has replicated it in four other towns and his blog is loaded with advertising. http://www.arlnow.com/   He created his own foothold.   There's a real hunger out there for people who actually have local news.   This was a tiny blog five years ago. Now it's a business: http://www.popville.com/  In my view: blogs that get readers do work. they go out and find out stuff that their readers don't know about. Basically, they function likes news orgs.          They are probably handy with cameras, so some well-made, perhaps silver, photo frames might be useful.       You will be hired in a heartbeat. At a newspaper I once worked at, we hired someone with a law degree who came to a similar conclusion about his career path. He had scant news experience but could write clearly and cleanly (editors love that) His great strength was his analytical ability, attention to detail and fact, which gave his work a lot of precision and intelligence. We loved having him on the staff, and he eventually went off to a job with a big league newspaper.   That aside, legal training will be a wonderful background for statehouse/congressional reporting.   Contact a local newspaper, ask to speak to an editor, tell him/her what it is you want to accomplish and ask for some freelance assignments -- just to get three or four clips. Also, don't rule out the plethora of websites that cover speciality news, they may be a way to begin to get traction. With so many layoffs, it's a tough world but there are still jobs and writers who have a solid edge (a law degree qualifies) can find work.        Pizza   I knew a fellow who was from Ohio. He went to a local college and studied Mandarin. He moved to Taiwan and got a job at an English-language paper thanks to his language skills. That was his dream.   A foreign correspondent may be one way, but if you can handle the languages your job options may really expand.    I've seen people bring portable laptop stands; which are actually very useful considering the odds it will standing room only at most things. Of course, it's just one more thing to carry.

For their appalling disregard of the truth and ethics in order to get pageviews ..   i don't know if that's the case here. rolling stone has delivered some outstanding work over the years, It's piece,  for instance, a few years back on the Afghanistan general was solid, gutsy work.  RS should invite poytner or some independent journalism professor to do a post-mortem. It would be instructive, to know how this break-down in fact checking happened.   The root cause of it has certainly not been revealed, so jumping to a conclusion that the motive was a page view grab doesn't make sense, especially considering RS's history in turning out quality work.       stay out of it. totally. tell the coach to bring up his concerns directly with the reporter. it's pretty weird that the coach felt the needed to go through a third party to reach you. i suspect a private conversation between the coach and reporter will put things back on track. if you become involved, you become involved, and your motives will be suspect.       I eat pizza once a week and live knowing that other regions of this great nation will never know what good pizza taste like.    Even if you take four majors, you'll still come up short. Climate change, for instance, wasn't really on radar in a big way when I graduated (80s), but now weaves into almost every subject area that you're likely to cover. The best thing to leave college with is a habit for lifelong learning.    Great story. It's well researched. It's probing. The reporter is doing her job and asking hard questions. If the story makes some people uncomfortable, that's just great.      I covered a long federal trial about 15 years ago that got international attention. During breaks, reporters would sometimes check their quotes against one another. I noticed that many of the EU/UK reporters knew shorthand, but the U.S. reporters did not.    There are many instances outside the court where shorthand will help, especially for on the spot interviews. Recorders can also wig-out the people you are interviewing.   I couldn't find a place that taught it.    A guy from Seattle shares impressions of condition of Metro and its stations and he's obviously a troll. Right. That's why conditions at the Metro stations he describes aren't good; it's because people here are blind to them.          http://www.reddit.com/r/grammar/   It's not fine. The Financial Times, an economic and business journal, carried the story on its front page, but with a global angle.    The WSJ opinion pages are anti-climate change. The lack of coverage in the WSJ print edition may be a consequence of its strident editorial page policy. I think it's affecting and clouding news judgment.   The protest could have been a jumping off point for a more introspective piece targeted to WSJ readers, such as: How much will climate matter in the mid-terms?       This Huffington Post piece is right on target. On the day of the march, NBC nightly news led its broadcast with the football domestic violence issue. The march -- which attracted over 300,000 people -- was given short coverage a little further down.       First we nuked, repeatedly, the Marshall Islands (Bikini Atoll), spread radiation far and wide, and now climate change will finish the islands off.    You are representing readers and, by virtue of your job, have a responsibility to ask questions. You can't let your readers down.   Take this to heart, embrace it, and keep your readers in the forefront of your mind.   And don't worry about asking dumb questions. In fact, get them to explain every little thing. Be firm about that. It takes a while to get up to speed on a new beat/job.   Here's the pricing:  If you order via AP, the 2014 physical book cost $20.95, plus $11.01 in shipping.   Amazon: You can buy the *2013* physical edition for $10.99, and is eligible for Prime.   Amazon sells the 2014 edition, but only through third parties. Cheapest was $27, plus 3.99 in shipping, or $30.99  (It seems as if AP has it so you get the best pricing on its site.)   2014 style guide online via AP: $26 or $16 for members of the AP.

I am a few months away from 60 and here is my 401K asset allocation:  Small/mid/specialty: 34% Large cap growth: 27% Global International: 22% Bonds: 15% Balanced: 1% Large Cap Value: 1%  I've had this asset allocation for about 10 years. Didn't touch it during the crash.    But I was planning to get conservative, and was thinking about moving about 50% into bonds, 30% into index and large cap; 10% international and 10% small cap.   However, with interest rate rise seemingly expected, I'm reading now that bonds may be a bad move, so not sure what do to. But with 5 years left to a theoretical retirement, I want to protect myself. Should I stick with my balance/asset allocation plan or try something else? Thanks for any insights.     Carl Bernstein was a college drop out.   H. L. Mencken didn't attend college.

He has some great and eerie comic books like Cinema Panopticum, Greetings from Hellville or The Number 73304-23-4153-6-96-8.   I would recommend Haunted next. And maybe Choke and Rant.   Pygmy is sadly the worst thing I have read by Palahniuk.   I think this is one of his best books, because it has the creativity, originality and passion of that young age when he started writing it. It has many unanswered questions maybe because it's more about mistery, poetry and atmosphere than about a definite plot. But every following book gets more and more conventional. The world of this setting and the story of the characters get better explained with more and more details with every book. The last books were almost insuferable for me regarding writing style but I can't deny it's a very very funny and imaginative saga.   I would sell the most valuable books, get some money and donate the rest of the collection to a public library. You would be doing something  great for your community and will feel great. If the collection is as big as you say the library could put it in a special section and put it your friend's dad name in his honor. That would be a great way to remember him. I work in a public library and we have a special collection named after a guy that made a huge donation of old books.    "We all float down here"   Bob   Thanks. I watched that moment twice and I still didn't get what I was looking at. Due to the angle of that shot, it seemed like there really was a tiny woman swimming in milk right there.   Wow. You are damn good. In fact I think I've seen some of your work before in tumblr.   Do you have some illustrations online that we can see? Not necessarily sleep related.   Or maybe it was... A ghost! *gasp*   I have experienced it lots of times for years, even several times in the same night. But it still scares me. I panic, but, well, I can't do anything, because you can't move, you can only breathe. So I've learned to just relax and wait until my body reacts.   God, that took forever. But, yeah, cool video indeed. I like all I see by Adult Swim.   Why did you have three different accounts? Couldn't you just unsuscribe from the subs you didn't like and subscribe to new ones?   I think you'll like White Suns. Their last album, Totem, is from 2014.  http://whitesuns.bandcamp.com/      This is one of the best things I've seen in Youtube.   And how would you say Reddit was before? I'm quite new here.   D-d-do you wanna go out with me on a date?   So,it's made of [vantablack](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/blackest-is-the-new-black-scientists-have-developed-a-material-so-dark-that-you-cant-see-it-9602504.html)?   That is a very cool old drawer.   I checked the Nightvale wiki: http://nightvale.wikia.com/wiki/Fey  Fey was merely a piece of self-aware software trapped in a heavily-defended metal box  And I guess the following can't be considered canon, since it's from the Thrilling Adventure Hour   Welcome to Night Vale Crossover:  Pemily Stallwark (played by Molly Quinn) is erased from existence. Before returning to existence moments later, she finds herself facing an endless stream of numbers and is forced to read them out loud, briefly breaking into "Roar" by Katy Perry at one point. This was a reference to both characters being voiced by Quinn. A "techno-theological debate" from earlier in the episode over whether or not robots (and presumably computers) have souls may hint that Stallwark is Fey's future reincarnation.     Don't subestimate human kind. It's capable of the most strange acts.   A computer program? I thought she was a real person, like those people reading numbers and talking in the "number stations".   I think you mean Casper.   This is an amazing story. I think Im gonna translate it into spanish and post it in one of my blogs, where sometimes I talk about weird and cool things that happen in videogames and virtual worlds.  Thanks for this.   Chronenberg-esque!   Apruebo esto.   "If this thing had happened, then this other thing would have happened." "What other thing?". "I don't know".  Anyway, I admit my comments are useless. The world is not gonna change thanks to them. And I know I'm not gonna convince you that you made a thread that makes no sense.   Then you made a useless thread.   A happening like what?   Yeah, thanks to smart phones and access to google translate.   Could you invite your friend to come to Reddit and elaborate on this? It's quite interesting.   French sounds great but I like even more the sound of portuguese.   For a european citizen like me, this is a very interesting aproach to the life of an american teenager in the 00's.   I normally don't use them. I know where to get the album in mp3 for free, like Soulseek, torrents or Mega. What's more, if I have the record it's probably because I already listened to it on mp3 and liked so much I decided to buy it.   I don't know. When you sneeze you expel saliva, and saliva uses to smell bad, because of lots of bacteria. At least, my saliva smells bad.   No. Journalists and professional photographers will continue using real cameras.   [Is a video good too?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UA4sifQ3ymk)   I'm following "Louie" but this 5th season had only 8 episodes and the last one was recently released.  I can recommend you some of my favorite shows: The Wire, The Sopranos, Rick and Morty, South Park, Twin Peaks, Lost, Friends, Adventure Time...   You weat matter?   Because art.   Well, he definitely looks like a frog.   So, let me see if I got this right... They were black?   This comic is quite old and have been posted here several times before. And I don't care.  Also recomending "Fuan no tane/seeds of anxiety". Most fucking terrifiying manga I've ever read. I read it alone at home at night and really felt uneasy.   That's a true ancient 4chan meme. I hadn't seen in for years.   Oh, my sweet summer child...   He will love to talk with you about ancient memes.   I agree. Thank you for the debate. It's been exciting. I even learned a pair of things about my own history.   Of course nowadays there are a lot of people against muslims in Spain, not only because of terrorism, but because millions of moroccan people started migrating here, and, you know, people are always afraid of immigrants, specially if they have a different religion and skin colour.  And yeah, while the Al Andalus era there was a real war between christians and muslims, the reconquest, and our hate for muslims comes from that long.   But I can assure you we don't hide or reject our muslim past. Is taught in the school. I am from Murcia, which was a muslim territory and we still have a strong legacy from them. We have moorish monuments, historical personalities like [Ibn Arabi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Arabi), streets designed by moorish and archeological remains. We even have a festivity called "Moros y Cristianos" (moors and christians) were people dress like medieval muslims and christians knights and courtiers, they make parades an emulate fights and battles. But I must admit I'm not proud of this festivity. It looks like a cheap cultural parody with those cheap ridiculous disguises.  Being that said, I'm not gonna lie to you: a lot of people now in Spain are racists and islamophobics who think that muslims are terrorists that should go back to Morocco.  But Al Andalus, yeah, that is cool for us.   I'll see if the number comes to me in my dreams tonight. If it doesn't, I'll try to elaborate some kind of occultist and symbolic ritual, probably summoning the spirit of Alan Turing and using a random numbers generator or something like that.   I'll post this here since I think it can be of general interest.  There is a debate going with the OP questioning if the term "pre-spanish" is appropiate. He affirms spanish era started after Al Andalus (moorish occupation in the south of the Iberian Peninsula for 8 centuries). Some of us affirm Spain was Spain before Al Andalus, being called Hispania even before the year 27 b.C. and that there were Spanish people living in the peninsula, people from different civilizations and origins, like romans and visigoths.  So, I asked a friend of mine. He is not a historian but has a degree in classic languages as latin and greek, so he knows one or two things about Spanish history. Here are some interesting points he gave me:  1. As OP affirms, modern Spain was in a great degree stablished after Al Andalus, after the "reconquest" when the Catholic Kings expeled the muslims from the peninsula. The feudal system, the main regions, the catholic religion were stablished then. So, Spain doesn't equal Hispania.  2. It's not so simple. You can't say Spain started being Spain after Al Andalus. Before Al Andalus there were the visigoths, and before them the hispanoromans living there. So Spain would be an equation consisting in: Hispanoromans + Visigoths + Moors / Reconquest.  3. There are books wrote by experts still debating about when did Spain started being Spain, so it's an open debate.  4. There is the idiomatic question. We didn't started talking arabic after Al Andalus, but kept using the same language we used before they came. Spanish comes from latin, not from arabic. It's a corruption of latin, so to say. So, linguistically, we have a "hispanic" identity, although we adopted a lot of words from arabic, like "almohada", "algibe" (just to put two examples) and the name for a lot of rivers like "Guadalquivir".  5. Indeed, you can't deny the Al Andalus era. Nobody is trying to do that. But you can't say Spain as a concept or territory didn't exist before them. It's more complex than that.  	69
 People should find his massage mobile and get a massage and then ask him if he knows what civil disobedience is... right before walking out the door without paying a dime.   For the sake of humanity that guy should stand out in the street more often.   I'd strongly suggest investing in Intel. With the new processor releases and those on the horizon targeting mobile, they're likely to take significant market share away from their rivals producing ARM based processors.  I've invested a large amount recently with intention to pull it out when it reaches near 40.   Those that are prosecuted are probably forced into a gag order, so it's unlikely we hear of all the bad results from non-anonymous disclosures.   The "world community" considers it unethical, but those performing the research/cloning would likely be governments and make themselves immune from their own laws.   Russia is really pumping up the anti-US sentiment. This week they also warned Russians travelling abroad to watch out for US teams that "hunt Russians". It's a cold war tactic.   Perhaps some of the social media companies being targeted should cut service to Russia and announce they cannot comply with the data rules, and therefore are removing their services per Russia's request. Russian citizens would likely direct their outrage towards the Russian government at that point, and the social media companies could re-emerge in the Russian market victorious.      The Saudi's probably won't lash out after this being their government shares much of the same ideology as the Islamic State, and IS struck a religious minority within Saudi Arabia. If Islamic State were to obtain their goals and become a state, it would probably look a lot like Saudi Arabia (where amputations and beheadings are already carried out routinely in public to scare the population into submission).   Less than 24 hours isn't nearly enough time of advance notice on mass media if you want a lot of people to attend your rally. Not only do people have to make the decision of whether they want to go or not, they'd also need time to plan for it.  If you want a real protest call it something like a "Rally for US" or "Rally for Freedom", and start spreading information about which cities are selected for demonstrations, at least a week in advance (even if the bill passes by then, with a big enough protest it's possible the demonstrations will spark calls to revoke the bill from within the senate).  Make those on social media feel like they 'are' the rally movement, and not just merely invited to someone else's party.  And last but not least, make sure you get volunteers to bring food. Protests will never last long without food vendors. Iron fisted governments target food vendors with high priority when looking to quell a protest, but I suspect you will not have that issue in the US.  Good luck. :)   Depression seems common in many degenerative diseases. I have an unnamed autoimmune based neurodegenerative disease and have spent a lot of time with specialists, and a couple have mentioned that the most prominent signs they see preceding significant cognitive decline due to neurological disorders are sudden severe depression and also changes in the ability to judge the passage of time.    This one still cracks me up: [Benny the Bull takes over a cooking show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4sZ6IBreZc)   Can confirm they don't work in Seattle either.    Haven't you heard of the large farticle collider?   Am I misreading? Or does this keep tissues from aging as quickly, as opposed to actually reversing damage?   Source?!?   How did you find a place on the planet Mercury?   I've never seen or heard of any truckers doing this either, and I know a lot from where I grew up. I think it's completely false information. To a trucker, a ticket should be avoided at pretty much any cost, and additionally no long haul trucking company would allow their drivers to do this. The potential damage to the tires alone would make it ridiculous.   Got it. Sorry if my response seemed terse. Protecting one's hearing should be an absolute priority regardless of tinnitus causes.   In older age, would the nerves be able to make much sense of the information? As this only replaces the lenses, the nerves would still be in their natural state, and it's my understanding that one significant cause of poor vision in the elderly is natural nerve degradation.   Many cases of tinnitus are idiopathic (unknown cause). Hearing damage due to loud noises is not always to blame.   Military spending in China has exploded in recent years as have capabilities. You can still have a massive military buildup without a massive increase in the number of soldiers. If anything it seems that the weaker the military tech, the more soldiers a country has.   Someone once told me "I'm amazed at how far you've gone with your life", but it was said in such a condescending way. I'm still not entirely sure if they were trying to get on my nerves, or if they actually meant well.    "The US Bureau of Labor Statistics lists that 915,000 people are employed in motor vehicles and parts manufacturing. Truck, bus, delivery, and taxi drivers account for nearly 6 million professional driving jobs. **Virtually all of these jobs will be eliminated within 10-15 years, and this list is by no means exhaustive.**"  This seems incredibly unlikely. Even if fully automated cars/trucks are commonly available by them, the switch is still going to be very gradual. A lot of people will still want their own cars even if they're automated, and it will likely take decades to transition there. Delivery companies don't have unlimited capital, and there are a lot of small companies out there, they aren't going to just switch the moment automated trucks become available.  I look forward to automated cars/trucks, but let's be realistic about it.   This is something I'd probably join a protest for, and I'm mostly against a lot of today's protests (not necessarily because of the ideas, but the lack of usefulness and structure).  Civil forfeiture has been used by the government as theft, plain and simple. For all of the publicized cases, just imagine how many unpublicized cases are sitting in the dark.   That's in reference to the upgrade from Win Phone 8.1 to Windows 10. Carriers choose when to push that update to existing users, but after that they are no longer in such control.   I'd love to see dedicated and potentially elevated bike routes developed in cities like Seattle. I'm an avid biker, and love riding on the weekends on trails, but even still there is no way I'd feel confident enough to get on one of the existing 'bike lanes' along the busy road. I'm sure if cities developed bike routes where riders didn't have to worry about crossing and riding alongside car traffic, the number of riders biking to and from work would explode.   Shit. I hope I never accidentally puncture my Comcast router.   Looks awesome.   Will you be using the storage tanks for drinking water too? If so you may want to check with the feed store, they look like poly tanks. While growing up out in the country years ago, we had a neighbor who wanted to setup poly tanks from the feed store for drinking water, but was told they are unsafe because chemicals leak out and they are often treated with fire retardants. It's probably fine, but you may wish to dig for a little more info about the tanks.  Edit: I should mention they did eventually setup poly tanks, but they had to get tanks that were certified to be safe for drinking water.    Unfortunately a lot of bacterial diseases are headed in this direction. The effective antibiotics left to treat them usually come with super high cost and very unwelcome side effects. Additionally there is a rather scary scenario where a previously antibiotic resistant infection responds to a different class of antibiotic, but by then it results in an opportunistic infection with resistant c. diff. bacteria. C.Diff bacteria is now highly resistant to antibiotics and kills more than 30,000 people each year in the US alone.   And here I am happy with myself if I can make it to the front door with all the grocery bags in one trip.   The title is poor, I clicked through expecting it to be some article related to general business through the internet.   ICANN is out of control and actually destroying the open nature of the web in my opinion, and it's making TLDs a joke. Google for example bought ALL the rights to .app domains. Nobody else can use them because ICANN is preferring big business over individuals. It's a step in the wrong direction and now everything is a mess.   It's going to get a whole lot worse too. The condo/apartment construction boom is far out pacing the growth of traffic capacity.  I moved to the Seattle area 10 years ago and it used to be smooth flowing traffic on the Eastside for the most part. Now it's a crawl. In Newcastle they are building a 900 unit condo/apartment complex without any major road modifications. 5 years from now we will likely look back on today's traffic with fondness =(   -Floyd Mayweather.      It's the truth. The last time I committed a random murder I got away because I did all these things! Nobody even knows I committed...  ^Shit.   Even if this misleading stat were true, it's a lot easier to expand an existing college campus than it is to expand a prison. Creating an entirely new university due to saturated capacities makes much less economical/administration sense than creating new prisons when they reach capacity.  For the most part, college campuses are continuing to expand across the country.   I grew up on a farm and was told by the chemical reps that Roundup was perfectly safe, so as a kid I was sent down into the canyons near our farm to spray out Canadian Thistles with a backpack sprayer full of roundup. Sometimes I'd come back soaked with it from blowback that came from the nozzle. I now have a lot of health issues, and it's clear Roundup is not as safe as Monsanto claims... but I had extremely heavy exposure as did my siblings and neighbors, and there were no acute effects from it. I find many cases of children dying from being near sprayed coca plantations in Columbia unlikely. If it's true children are dying near the sprayed coca, it must either be from something else besides Roundup, or they are being exposed to heavy quantities of Roundup in some other way. Getting caught in the spray from a helicopter/plane is not that much exposure.   Maybe she likes what she does? If she worked 60 years as an operating room nurse and didn't make any major financial mistakes I'm sure she'd be wealthy enough to retire. Thankfully nurses and those in healthcare get paid quite well, especially those in the operating/emergency departments.   Keeping the mind busy and feeling like you're contributing something seems to have a major impact on longevity and health.    Aging sucks =\   Jesus. Everybody in the initial situation lacked street smarts. If you see people fighting/arguing without many other bystanders around, standing in the middle of the street and recording them, and then being somewhat verbally combative with them is not a smart move. It's likely only going to escalate the situation.  It seems pretty common for people to get into arguments near  bars when I'm in Idaho, and when that happens I'll just chill inconspicuously nearby either alone or with friends. In almost all cases either the argument burns out, or the cops come... But if I were to stand in the street obviously filming them when they were already running on adrenaline, nothing good is going to come of it.  Hopefully this guy now knows he shouldn't try the 'in your face' type filming he does with police; with ordinary people already distressed... without expecting escalation.   No luck for me. Was your tinnitus associated with loud noises? Mine is related to brain damage and the drumming didn't seem to cause any change.      I tend to work late hours, so most of my 'free time' is at the end of the day.  I was also moving between high population areas, so I preferred to drive the U-Haul truck at night when traffic was almost non-existent.   I'm not a cop, but a few years ago when I was moving into a house I was doing most of my moving late at night. The nosy old couple across the street kept calling the cops and reporting suspicious activity.  The first time the cops showed up they were prepared for a criminal (hands on guns, flashlights in my eyes). But by the 4th time they just BSed with me and finally told the couple to stop calling the police.  I'm not sure what made the couple think burglars would bring stuff into the house instead of taking it out.   If you look up specs for your SSD you'll see the data retention rate in the spec. For consumer level drives it is typically 3 months. For example here is a spec for Seagate drives: http://www.seagate.com/www-content/product-content/ssd-fam/600-pro-ssd/en-us/docs/100727924b.pdf . Section 2.1 lists the data retention rate.  As far as how the data is lost, assuming manufacturing quality is generally consistent across the drive... you'll theoretically lose the cells with the most write cycles first. Most consumer drives store 2 bits per cell, so you'll be losing 2 bits at the lowest level, but depending on how the flash controller is designed you'll likely be losing larger blocks of data once you hit the data retention threshold under the right conditions.  Most people will likely be able to store the data for years without problems. The data retention period is basically what the manufacturer is guaranteeing with their spec before they see any risk.   **Edit:** I looked up a Sandisk whitepaper about a controller  (http://www.sandisk.com/assets/docs/NetApp%20Write-Intensive%20SSD%20White%20Paper.pdf) and it has a good write-up about data retention:   We work closely with OEM partners to provide needed device-replacement guidance, as well as information related to expected data retention (that is, how long the flash media can retain data before it becomes unreliable). It is important to be aware that there is a limited data retention period once SSDs have been removed from service (that is, powered off). Retention is also dependent on operating and storage temperatures and the endurance remaining on the device when it was taken out of service. Although the data retention period for some HDDs can be measured in years, SSD retention is more typically measured in weeks or days once the device is powered off. The Lightning Write-Intensive SAS SSDs are capable data retention of 90 days at end of life   They still have some lesser-known hurdles to overcome, most consumer drives have a relatively low data retention period of ~3 months. What is a "data retention period" for SSDs? It's the length of time the manufacture claims you can have an SSD powered off before it'll begin to lose data.  Unlike mechanical magnetic hard-drives, today's SSDs need to be periodically powered on or else they will begin to lose data. I don't think many people realize this, even those using them in enterprise solutions. So mechanical hard drives won't be able to be replaced by SSDs at the consumer level for all scenarios, until consumer SSDs data retention rates improve, even if SSDs are eventually cheaper. For this reason, we probably won't be seeing any trustworthy external backup drives using SSDs for a long while.   My only other option is satellite, and due to the high latency that'd really limit what I can do. I like Comcast service when they aren't being so snakey.   They are the devil when it comes to making money without caring about individual customers. They charged me $50 for a "tech visit" when the cable to the house wasn't working. The line to my lot had been physically disconnected and it wasn't my issue, but they charged me for it. When I called I spent almost an hour talking with support to get it removed, and finally after saying no repeatedly they said they'd drop $20 off the charge like they were doing me a huge favor.  Fuck Comcast.   Win2k8 is Vista Kernel, Win2k8 R2 is Win7.   Being stood up on a first date. I've had a lot of very successful dates, but just thinking about the two times I got stood up makes me feel awful. Even if they claim the next day that they fell asleep, it's still a piercing dagger through the heart of self-esteem.   It's the same maneuver he pulls at the office when somebody is about to take the last cup of coffee.   Not really, it wasn't a very serious relationship so I wasn't very tied to it. When we went out she wasn't hitting on other guys, so there was little for me to be insecure about. As far as the money goes, sure she may have made more in a short period of time, but my career has continued to grow and I have my sights set on launching a startup company. Feeling emasculated by comparing my income to hers wouldn't be reasonable considering we were both going down different paths.   haha. No she didn't, she just danced I'm pretty sure.    I'm friends with a girl who cammed, and she probably made more than me, and I'm making a very decent living. We dated/hung out for a while and I helped her get her own website up where she'd direct viewers from her cam shows... Some days she'd spend an entire afternoon/evening cam'ing and make several thousand dollars.  Eventually she stopped because she wanted to be a good role model for her young daughter (though it's not like her kid was around when she was on the cam), but I'm sure she made well over two hundred thousand in a relatively short period of time, because she bought a condo in downtown Seattle. It was crazy. It was also awkward at times, because here I was working my career and saving for a house, and she was pretty much getting more money thrown at her for talking and dancing at home... But I don't hate on it, it's a much much safer way for a girl to make quick money than some of the alternatives, especially if they are smart about it.   The most powerful tyrant would be able to convince the people to vote out his foes.   I still have a very diversified "portfolio" outside of MSFT, and from my perspective if MSFT suddenly tanks then there is probably something very significant happening with the economy and it's unlikely I'd be any safer in other dividend stocks.   I may be bias because I'm an employee, but MSFT is my go to dividend stock, followed by Johnson   Johnson.  Growth is all about timing, so I don't really have a favorite.  I don't like taking major risk, so my 'growth' stocks may not be viewed as such by everyone. But lately I've had a lot of stock in Disney for growth, though it's slowing down and I'm looking at energy related stocks as replacements.   Not seen are the plug-ups of frustrating despair. That soil and dampness is just about perfect in the gif.    In their early/mid 20s I think people still believe they can get super rich by putting in great day-to-day work at a very well established corporation. By their late 20s and early 30s it begins to become clear that those dreams are rarely reached unless you're willing to work there until your 40s or 50s. When that realization is hit I think most people will either quit to create/join a startup, or de-emphasize work and focus on their personal lives instead.      Whichever nation first begins to successfully tweak genes prior to birth will likely be the forefathers of Earth's future dominant species.      There are a lot of illnesses out there that attack the nerves and can cause temporary paralysis, one of the most well known being "Guillain-Barre Syndrome". People with GBS can be fine one week and paralyzed the next, only to recover days or weeks later.   Unfortunately however, neurology is still a very young field and there are many unknowns still out there. I was partially paralyzed in 2012 after having a year of slowly progressing neurological issues and spent a month in the hospital. The paralysis went away but the other issues continue. Tests were run daily, experts from universities came in, yet nobody was able to determine the exact cause. It's crazy.   The impact of this could be huge. Nearly a million people are estimated to die from HBV each year, and many many more likely undergo chronic suffering related to the havoc it wreaks on the body. A cure would give so many people their lives back.      Far more people have died in the Mexico drug war in the last 8 years, than people have died in the Afghanistan war in the last 14. It really puts things into perspective about just how bad things are in Mexico.   Somewhere in one of those buildings, someone is sitting in a bathroom having the worst shit of their lives.      If it's a formal declaration, I'd first sell all my stocks and transfer all my cash to the same bank. Then I'd go to that bank, take out a significant amount of cash and buy silver as a hedge against the possibility of a future financial system collapse. After hauling it to a secure location, I'd load up on food staples with long shelf lives to increase my chances of survival in the event of severe food disruptions.  I'd talk to my parents who live on a farm and work with them to provide long-lasting food supplies as well. Then I'd buy a motorcycle and extra gas for if I need to get out of the city and make it to my parents' farm.  I wouldn't really be worried about a nuclear attack, but I'd be worried about disruption of already fragile systems (power, food   fuel supply).  After increasing the chances of my survival for a future disturbance, I'd seek out individuals/companies/the government in search of war projects that I could assist with... Because I find it doubtful that a war with Russia would require a massive draft, yet I'd like to help where I can.      Is it really original content if it's based on someone else's graph that happened to have some flaws?    The major loss of functions and capabilities with age. If you were to take the effects of aging to even 55 and put them into a 20 year old, it'd be considered a horrendous disease that causes incredible suffering.    This year the top of Snoqualmie Pass has experienced less than half the snowfall of the previous *60 year* low record. It's quite extreme.  The good news is that Washington is still getting a lot of precipitation, so if those managing the reservoirs make smart decisions to hold back more water earlier than usual, there probably won't be a catastrophic water shortage.      It's just so much mass though.    Maybe he was next in line.   This statistic can also be misleading. Just because you are in debt does not necessarily mean you are poor.   You monster.      Have you set it up as an LLC or other official business entity? And are you prepared to properly handle the taxes?   This thread is also full of a lot of negative jealousy. Good for you op, and don't let the haters bring you down. If this endeavour is successful then that's awesome! If it's not successful, then you'll learn something from it, and that's pretty awesome too.   This thread is full of a lot of negative jealousy.

 He was responding to a post where the other guy (in response to me) said:  You're probably not black.   So /u/Not_the_brightest followed up by stating he was black.  Why?  Likely so the guy who was so concerned about skin color knew what "direction" it was coming from.   1,507  That's the number of people polled.  Let's not put too much emphasis into those stats.   Where'd I say that?   Exactly. It's like a footnote in time already. And once again, this country's obsession with symbols is what's important.    Well, I certainly can't think of any flags that teach people an ideology.  Only people can do that, along with giving seemingly unimportant things "meaning."    but this specific issue is simple to understand  And the reason why I believe people are so focused on it.  To look at and attempt to solve the real problem is not simple.   and where could someone learn about an ideology that believes black people are inferior?  Other people.     All of Reddit thanks you for this update.  It's sure to grab everyone's attention as it sits buried amongst the other 900+ comments for this article.   The more I read about the crap this guy says, the more I'm convinced that he still aligns himself as a Democrat (2001-2009) and is actually trying to sink the GOP in the next election.

It's the ideology/mental health that is the problem.  On a side note, the first thing I think of when I see the flag is the Dukes of Hazzard and the General Lee.     Relevant text:  Bass is also famous in Japan for the "Curse of the Colonel". Following the 1985 Series victory, revelers celebrated by calling off the names of team members one by one. At each name, a fan who looked like that player would jump into the filthy Dotonbori canal. For Bass, someone threw a life-sized model of Colonel Sanders, the mascot of Kentucky Fried Chicken and the only close-at-hand likeness of a bearded American, into the river. The statue disappeared and is said to have caused the subsequent decade-long dismal performance in the Central League.  In an attempt to remove the curse, fans made repeated attempts to find the model, making offerings to the statues of the Colonel for forgiveness. In 2003, when the Tigers returned to the Japan Series after 18 years with one of the worst records in the Central League, many KFC outlets in Kbe and saka moved their Colonel Sanders statues inside until the series was over to protect them from rabid Tigers fans. The newly replaced Colonel Sanders statue in the Dotonbori KFC branch was bolted down to prevent a repeat of the incident.  On March 10, 2009, the top half of the statue (minus hands and legs) originally thrown into the Dotonbori River was recovered during construction of a walkway. A diver said that he had thought he had found a large barrel, but was surprised when it turned out to be the upper body of the Colonel. The statue's legs and right hand were recovered the following day. The statue is still missing its glasses and left hand. The statue of Colonel Sanders is currently in a KFC franchise across the street from Koshien Stadium.

He was involved with the Declaration of Independence but abstained hoping for a reconciliation with Britain.      Relevant text:  As a boy, John Wilkes Booth was athletic and popular, becoming skilled at horsemanship and fencing. A sometimes indifferent student, he attended the Bel Air Academy (now Bel Air High School), where the headmaster described him as "[n]ot deficient in intelligence, but disinclined to take advantage of the educational opportunities offered him. Each day he rode back and forth from farm to school, taking more interest in what happened along the way than in reaching his classes on time". In 18501851, he attended the Quaker-run Milton Boarding School for Boys located in Sparks, Maryland, and later St. Timothy's Hall, an Episcopal military academy in Catonsville, Maryland, beginning when he was 13 years old. At the Milton school, students recited such classical works as those by Herodotus, Cicero, and Tacitus. Students at St. Timothy's wore military uniforms and were subject to a regimen of daily formation drills and strict discipline. Booth left school at 14, after his father's death.  While attending the Milton Boarding School, Booth met a Gypsy fortune-teller who read his palm and pronounced a grim destiny, telling Booth that he would have a grand but short life, doomed to die young and "meeting a bad end". His sister recalled that Booth wrote down the palm-reader's prediction and showed it to his family and others, often discussing its portents in moments of melancholy in later years.      doing my part for reddit   Funny you claim to be doing your part for reddit.

Information concerning this illness was cloaked in a climate of fear and denial. Over 75,000 people died each year of cancer in just the United States. The top item on the founders agenda was to raise awareness of cancer, before any other progress could be made in funding research. Therefore a frenetic writing campaign was undertaken to educate doctors, nurses, patients and family members about cancer. Articles were written for popular magazines and professional journals. The ASCC undertook to publish their own journal, Campaign Notes, which was a monthly bulletin with information about cancer. They began recruiting doctors from all over the United States to help educate the public about cancer.

After an initially positive reaction, Reddit users began to become suspicious of Matt's intentions, and suggested that he was keeping the donations for himself. Users telephoned his home and he received death threats. Matt eventually proved that he was genuine by uploading his doctor's records.      Relevant text:   The Boondock Saints is a 1999 American crime film written and directed by Troy Duffy. The film stars Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as fraternal twins, Connor and Murphy MacManus, who become vigilantes after killing two members of the Russian Mafia in self-defense. After both experience an epiphany, the brothers, together with their friend "Funny Man" (David Della Rocco), set out to rid their home city of Boston, Massachusetts of crime and evil, all while being pursued by FBI Agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe).  Duffy indicates that the screenplay was inspired by personal experience, while living in Los Angeles. Initially regarded as one of the hottest scripts in Hollywood, the movie had a troubled production and was finally given a limited theatrical release of only five theaters for one week due to the Columbine High School massacre. It was met with poor critical reviews; however, the film ultimately grossed about $50 million in domestic video sales and developed a large cult following.       Relevant text:   While Sega was seeking a flagship series to compete with Nintendo's Mario series with a character to replace Alex Kidd as the company's mascot, several character designs were submitted by its Sega AM8 research and development department. Many results came forth from their experiments with character design, including an armadillo (who was later developed into Mighty the Armadillo), a dog, a Theodore Roosevelt look-alike in pajamas (who would later be the basis of Dr. Robotnik/Eggman's design), and a rabbit (who would use its extendable ears to collect objects, an aspect later incorporated in Ristar).  Eventually, Naoto Ohshima's spiky teal hedgehog, initially codenamed "Mr. Needlemouse",was chosen as the new mascot. Sonic's blue pigmentation was chosen to match Sega's cobalt blue logo, and his shoes evolved from a design inspired by Michael Jackson's boots with the addition of the color red, which was inspired by both Santa Claus and the contrast of those colors on Jackson's 1987 album Bad; his personality was based on Bill Clinton's "Get it done" attitude.       Relevant text:   Christopher Lloyd was cast as Doc Brown after the first choice, John Lithgow, became unavailable. Having worked with Lloyd on The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai (1984), producer Neil Canton suggested him for the part. Lloyd originally turned down the role, but changed his mind after reading the script and at the persistence of his wife. He improvised some of his scenes, taking inspiration from Albert Einstein and conductor Leopold Stokowski. Brown pronounces gigawatts as "jigawatts", which was the way a physicist said the word when he met with Zemeckis and Gale as they researched the script, rather than with an initial hard "g", although both pronunciations are acceptable. Doc Brown's notable hunch came about because at 6'1" Lloyd was considerably taller than Fox at 5'5", and they needed to look closer in height.       Relevant text:   Tom Scholz was born in Toledo, Ohio and raised in the suburb of Ottawa Hills. His father, Don Scholz, was a homebuilder who garnered considerable wealth from his designs of prefabricated luxury houses and founded Scholz Design, the forerunner of Scholz Homes Inc.  His mother Olive was valedictorian of her class, and went on to become an architectural designer and a landscape architect.  As a child, Scholz studied classical piano. He also had a penchant for tinkering with everything from go-carts to model airplanes and was always building or designing. A top student and a member of the varsity basketball team, he graduated from Ottawa Hills High School in 1965. Prior to his musical career, Scholz received both a bachelor's degree (1969) and a master's degree (1970) in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and worked for Polaroid Corporation as a senior product design engineer. Scholz would then reside in Boston.       Relevant text:   In 1998, the tabloid newspaper The Globe reported that Malone had been a defendant in paternity lawsuits, filed shortly after Malone began his professional basketball career in the late 1980s, which alleged that he was the father of three children by two women from his hometown of Summerfield, Louisiana: Demetress Bell and twins Daryl and Cheryl Ford. Malone was 17 when the Ford twins were born to Bonita Ford, who was approximately the same age. However, Malone was a 20-year old college sophomore when Gloria Bell, at age 13, gave birth to Demetress. In the aftermath of the Globe story, Malone met with the Ford twins for the first time since visiting them in the hospital after they were born. Malone did not meet with Bell at that time, and Malone's attorney insisted that Malone had settled the lawsuits prior to any conclusive establishment of paternity, and thus still did not know whether he was truly the father of any of the children.  The Tribune confirmed that the judge in the Bell lawsuit ruled Malone to be the father, not based on presented evidence, but rather because Malone did not respond to the suit. However, the paper also examined court documents detailing the evidence that was to have been presented had Malone responded and a trial ensued. One of the items listed was a laboratory blood test which concluded with over 99 percent certainty that Bell's father was either Malone or a brother of Malone. The paper also reported that applying that same blood sample to the Ford twins resulted in a similarly high probability of paternity by Malone. According to the Tribune, Malone challenged the court's ruling with regard to Bell, claiming that the judgment holding him responsible for $125 per week in child support, plus past and future medical expenses, was excessive. Before Malone's appeal was adjudicated, the lawsuit was settled on confidential terms. In the case regarding the Ford twins, Malone was ruled to be their father when he violated a court order by refusing to reveal his assets or submit to a DNA test. Thereafter, another out-of-court settlement was reached.  By the fall of 1998, Malone accepted his paternity of the Ford twins, and Kay Malone spoke publicly of the twins being members of the Malone family. Since that time, Karl Malone has maintained a relationship with the twins, each of whom later played college basketball at his alma mater of Louisiana Tech University. Cheryl Ford went on to a professional basketball career with the Detroit Shock of the Women's National Basketball Association.  To date, Malone has made no public comment with regard to Bell, who is now an offensive lineman for the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League. In 2008, The Buffalo News reported that Bell's first and only meeting with Malone came shortly after Bell graduated from high school. According to Bell, Malone told him at that time that it was "too late" for them to have a father-son relationship.       Relevant text:  A Brazilian woman has confessed to trying to kill her husband by putting poison in her vagina and urging him to have oral sex with her, a news agency claims.  The bizarre murder plot, dubbed "cunning cunnilingus" by one commentator, took place in the city of Sao de Jose Rio Preto. The intended victim, a 43-year-old man who has not been named, says his wife tried to lure him into bed and encouraged him to perform oral sex on her. His suspicions were aroused when he noticed an unusual odour emanating from her private parts and, fearing she was unwell, took her to hospital, Brazil's Tvi24 reports. Medical tests revealed she had doused her vagina with enough of the unspecified toxin to kill both her husband and herself.  Confronted with the test results the woman reportedly confessed to her crime. It is believed she hatched the bizarre plot after asking her husband for a divorce, a request he now seems rather more likely to acquiesce to. Tvi24 says the woman has received medical treatment and sources claim her husband plans to sue her for attempted murder.       say that you like anal sex  After the show, Pat Robertson had a train run on him by a large group of male farm animals.

He received the Medal of Honor for leading an attack on a German machine gun nest, taking 32 machine guns, killing 20 German soldiers, and capturing 132 others. This action occurred during the United States-led portion of the broader Meuse-Argonne Offensive in France masterminded by Marshal Ferdinand Foch to breach the Hindenburg line and make the opposing German forces surrender.       Relevant text:   Unable to support himself, on May 27, 1827, Poe enlisted in the United States Army as a private. Using the name "Edgar A. Perry", he claimed he was 22 years old even though he was 18. He first served at Fort Independence in Boston Harbor for five dollars a month. That same year, he released his first book, a 40-page collection of poetry, Tamerlane and Other Poems, attributed with the byline "by a Bostonian". Only 50 copies were printed, and the book received virtually no attention. Poe's regiment was posted to Fort Moultrie in Charleston, South Carolina and traveled by ship on the brig Waltham on November 8, 1827. Poe was promoted to "artificer", an enlisted tradesman who prepared shells for artillery, and had his monthly pay doubled. After serving for two years and attaining the rank of Sergeant Major for Artillery (the highest rank a noncommissioned officer can achieve), Poe sought to end his five-year enlistment early. He revealed his real name and his circumstances to his commanding officer, Lieutenant Howard. Howard would only allow Poe to be discharged if he reconciled with John Allan and wrote a letter to Allan, who was unsympathetic. Several months passed and pleas to Allan were ignored; Allan may not have written to Poe even to make him aware of his foster mother's illness. Frances Allan died on February 28, 1829, and Poe visited the day after her burial. Perhaps softened by his wife's death, John Allan agreed to support Poe's attempt to be discharged in order to receive an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point.  Poe finally was discharged on April 15, 1829, after securing a replacement to finish his enlisted term for him. Before entering West Point, Poe moved back to Baltimore for a time, to stay with his widowed aunt Maria Clemm, her daughter, Virginia Eliza Clemm (Poe's first cousin), his brother Henry, and his invalid grandmother Elizabeth Cairnes Poe. Meanwhile, Poe published his second book, Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems, in Baltimore in 1829.  Poe traveled to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830. In October 1830, John Allan married his second wife, Louisa Patterson. The marriage, and bitter quarrels with Poe over the children born to Allan out of affairs, led to the foster father finally disowning Poe. Poe decided to leave West Point by purposely getting court-martialed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church. Poe tactically pled not guilty to induce dismissal, knowing he would be found guilty.       Relevant text:  Elmo is self-described as three-and-a-half years old and his birthday is on February 3. Elmo characteristically avoids pronouns, referring to himself in the third person (e.g. "Elmo wants this" instead of, "I want this").

Relevant text:  Bologna sausage, sometimes phonetically spelled as baloney, boloney or polony, is a sausage derived from the Italian mortadella, a similar looking finely ground pork sausage containing cubes of lard, originally from the Italian city of Bologna.  U.S. Government regulations require American bologna to be finely ground  and without visible pieces of lard. Bologna can alternatively be made out of chicken, turkey, beef, pork, venison or soy protein. Unlike the mortadella, bologna sausage is not an Italian product and there are several differences among process and ingredients. Typical seasoning for bologna includes black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, celery seed, coriander, and like mortadella, myrtle berries give it its distinctive flavor.

It was to be the first time in history that 14 cities were connected in real time for a press conference via telephone lines. Chevrolet general manager Pete Estes started the news conference stating that all attendees of the conference were charter members of the Society for the Elimination of Panthers from the Automotive World and that this would be the first and last meeting of SEPAW. Estes then announced a new car line, project designation XP-836, with a name that Chevrolet chose in keeping with other car names beginning with the letter C such as the Corvair, Chevelle, Chevy II, and Corvette. He claimed the name, suggests the comradeship of good friends as a personal car should be to its owner and that to us, the name means just what we think the car will do... go. The Camaro name was then unveiled. Automotive press asked Chevrolet product managers, what is a Camaro? and were told it was a small, vicious animal that eats Mustangs.

A co-owner of the Satellite Restaurant at that time - along with his brother, Nick Panopoulos - Sam and his brother were business partners for approximately 50 years. The brothers would later build on the popularity of the Hawaiian Pizza and begin serving their next creation - the Hawaiian Burger.          Relevant text:   Bridget Driscoll (1851  17 August 1896) was the first pedestrian victim of an automobile collision in the United Kingdom. As she and her teenage daughter May and her friend Elizabeth Murphy crossed Dolphin Terrace in the grounds of the Crystal Palace in London, Driscoll was struck by an automobile belonging to the Anglo-French Motor Carriage Company that was being used to give demonstration rides. One witness described the car as travelling at "a reckless pace, in fact, like a fire engine".  Although the car's maximum speed was 8 miles per hour (13 km/h) it had been limited deliberately to 4 miles per hour (6.4 km/h), the speed at which the driver, Arthur James Edsall of Upper Norwood, claimed to have been travelling. His passenger, Alice Standing of Forest Hill, alleged he modified the engine to allow the car to go faster, but another taxicab driver examined the car and said it was incapable of exceeding 4.5 miles per hour (7.2 km/h) because of a low-speed engine belt. The accident happened just a few weeks after a new Act of Parliament had increased the speed limit for cars to 14 miles per hour (23 km/h), from 2 miles per hour in towns and 4 miles per hour in the countryside.

Relevant text:  In East Asia, same-sex love has been referred to since the earliest recorded history. Homosexuality in China, known as the passions of the cut peach and various other euphemisms has been recorded since approximately 600 BCE. Homosexuality was mentioned in many famous works of Chinese literature. The instances of same-sex affection and sexual interactions described in the classical novel Dream of the Red Chamber seem as familiar to observers in the present as do equivalent stories of romances between heterosexual people during the same period. Confucianism, being primarily a social and political philosophy, focused little on sexuality, whether homosexual or heterosexual. Ming Dynasty literature, such as Bian Er Chai (/), portray homosexual relationships between men as more enjoyable and more "harmonious" than heterosexual relationships. Writings from the Liu Song Dynasty by Wang Shunu claimed that homosexuality was as common as heterosexuality in the late 3rd century.  Opposition to homosexuality in China originates in the medieval Tang Dynasty (618907), attributed to the rising influence of Christian and Islamic values, but did not become fully established until the Westernization efforts of the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China.

Bradbury graduated from Los Angeles High School, where he took poetry classes with Snow Longley Housh, and short story writing courses taught by Jeannet Johnson. The teachers recognized his talent and furthered his interest in writing, but he did not attend college. Instead, he sold newspapers at the corner of South Norton Avenue and Olympic Boulevard. In regard to his education, Bradbury said:  Libraries raised me. I don't believe in colleges and universities. I believe in libraries because most students don't have any money. When I graduated from high school, it was during the Depression and we had no money. I couldn't go to college, so I went to the library three days a week for 10 years.

 First, thank you for your time. Eating non-processed foods, there is usually a higher ratio of potassium to sodium than what is normally eaten by modern people (modern diets tend to be extremely sodium heavy with minimal potassium as you know). There was a small but growing body of research a few years ago that restoring this ratio such that potassium intake is higher than sodium intake had a slew of health benefits - reducing hypertension, heart attack and stroke risk, even if the actual amount of sodium consumed didn't decrease. Essentially boosting potassium intake above sodium negated most of the negative health impacts of a sodium heavy diet.  Has there been more research about this? Was it a fluke?   Is it a spoiler when the book has been out for 5 years?   We actually had a couple where it had migrated. It was usually near the area, but sometimes off to the side a bit. The eggs may not have been super fresh, and as they age they tend to dehydrate (so the air bubble gets a bit larger and can move a tiny bit), so that could be a reason for that.   This is almost exactly what we did! The hard part was figuring out where the air bubble was, because that was the best place to start. Luckily if you put them in water, the air bubble usually was the place pointing upwards. Once we found that we could do exactly what you said. The ones where we couldn't find the air bubble got a little more gouged up.   Hey folks. We are usually base camping or car camping. My old first aid kit is almost entirely expired, and most of the useful stuff has been used up by this point, so it is time to get a new one.  What I am looking for is a good first aid kit that has really good coverage. One built for camping. I'd really like it if the kit has a snake bite kit (PA is known for being super rocky, and we see a lot of snakes on trail). Ideally it should be small or flexible enough to put in a hydration pack.  Anyone have any favorites that they can recommend?   Or am I just better off assembling it myself and spending a tiny bit more cash?   I thought good samaritan laws were in place at a federal level?   Was it cake? Please let it be cake. I like cake.   Whoa, did reddit just get real?    Did... did she tell you to say that? It's ok, we're just reddit, you can tell us. She can't hurt you here \*brohug\*   Anything with an edge can cut you.  True story: when I was in elementary school, while I was in the lunch line with my tray and my milk, a friend snuck up on me. He jumped out to spook me and I dropped my tray. The tray hit the ground and the milk carton bounced off of it. I had leaned down to try and grab it, and the milk carton hit my face. A lunchlady came over and ordered me to go to the nurse immediately. I didnt know why... then I saw the blood dripping. The wax sealing the carton shut had sliced clean through my eyelid, requiring 3 stitches.  My buddy still gives me shit about getting my ass kicked by a milk carton. I could totally see a plastic cup being a deadly weapon :P   I seriously just showed the pic to my wife specifically because of the letter :)   Glad we could help! When we were trying to remove the yolks we actually found that just trusting the white not to tear worked the best.  Shelling them was a PITA, but not too horrid.

So, by your definition people who have no political control over the place where they live do not have their own country. This is by your assertion:  They just didn't have political control over the territory, i.e. "their own country".  So, would you say that North Koreans, who have no political control over their territory as a people, do not have a country?  You also should be careful before you start guessing about what people do and don't know when you don't know who they are or where they've lived and served.   The way this is decribed makes me think of the game Asteroids. It makes me wonder if all of those little organizations are going to start vying for power - in which case this could only get worse.   And usually leading to social issues to show that it doesn't actually help. Raj is portrayed as a jerk when he drinks. Sheldon took off his pants and told off a panel of judges. They don't paint alcohol "just" as a good thing.   About 3 dollars at a Chinese market. They're tiny, so you get about 2 dozen.   I really dislike the logic that "they didn't have a country to give up." That's the same bullshit people said when they made my family walk in the trail of tears. Because some old white man didn't draw lines around it, it's not a country? How fucking presumptuous and ethnocentric can a human being be? Just because your country, specifically rich people in your country, don't recognize what they live in as a country doesn't mean that to them it isn't a country.   Well, to be fair, the US and UK created Israel in the 1950's after Britain realized it couldn't control Zionist terrorist organizations that eventually went on to become the Israeli government. It conveniently coincided time-wise with the end of the WWI mandates over massive portions of the region, and provided a great way to keep military bases, and thus influence, in the region. Since we created Israel, we kind of have a right to discuss it.  And before you try to correct me that there weren't Zionist terrorist organizations, google "King David Hotel bombing" and "Irgun."

There's a way higher yolk:white ratio so they're much richer   We had leftover quail eggs after attempting to replicate the guanciale, chorizo, potato and quail egg pizza from Pizza Rock in Las Vegas. The pizza was kind of a bust, but the leftover quail eggs just so happened to make tiny bite sized deviled eggs!  They're way richer than normal deviled eggs, but they taste great!      LOL, I am looking at getting a PS4 as is, so I figured if it resolved the issue I'd just pick it up a little ahead of schedule :) Does the PS4 come with a SSD? Or is it a traditional hard disk? (if you know)   Honestly, the lag time to do much of anything in Destiny is really getting to me. Starting up the game? Wait 5 minutes. Go to orbit? Wait 2 minutes. Going to the tower? Wait 3 minutes. Trying to pop a synth? Wait 20 seconds for the inventory screen to load up.  I was never sure if it was the game system, or if it was because it had to talk back and forth with the server.  Does upgrading to PS4 help resolve the ridiculous load times?   This is awesome, I will definitely check it out!   Got it, in that case, I think the law makes sense. I mean, if you knowingly destroy something that someone else benefits from, you should have some amount of liability.   Oh I entirely agree with you! And I honestly think that there are some very good uses for algorithms, especially when it comes to keeping the various exchanges in sync using arbitrage! I'd venture to say that they're serving a vital purpose in that capacity.   I agree that they're dealing with different entities, and the levels may not be the same.   My main point is that regulators capitulating to the entities they are supposed to regulate absolutely has precedents, especially when money is involved. This happens in the financial industry, in the oil industry, in the mining industry, telecom, etc - every industry. While I agree it may not be to a comparable level, I find the assertion that it doesn't happen at all to be suspect given the precedents.  Your original statement was: If his book details actual cheating then why aren't they being prosecuted? **Do you think regulators just willingly turn a blind eye to this? Why would they do that?**  Like I said, there are precedents that greed or regulatory culture would motivate regulators to turn a blind eye to malfeasance. That was the statement I was responding to with the example to show that it does happen. The entities are less important than the fact that regulators can and do ignore things that they should be stopping.   There is an excellent article you should check out about secret recordings between the Fed, Goldman, and regulators. Essentially, the regulators do whatever the banks tell them to, and don't question it. I'm not saying it isn't a conspiracy theory, but it has some teeth and evidence to support it.  http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/536/the-secret-recordings-of-carmen-segarra   So the bouyant effect would be as follows:  HFT firm X sees an order coming in on BATS for 10000 shares of stock Y at 50. Only 50 shares are available on BATS. X sees the order come in, and immediately purchases all available shares at 50 that aren't on BATS, and relists them immediately at 50.05 before shares can be purchased from other exchanges. The market price is now effectively 50.05.   Another order comes in to BATS at 50.05, and the same thing happens, except relisting at 50.09.  Thus creating a bouyant effect on the market.  I am by no means an expert, so this is probably a gross simplification. But it's the way I understood it and I think it illustrates my concern. Suppose that is 85% of trade volume (ignoring shorting for now)... you could see how that could have a ballooning effect over time. Given the meteoric recovery of the stock market after the recession, it made me curious.   You know, I didnt even think about shorting. Great point!   If HFT traders make their money by buying low and selling high with methods like front running, and that is 85 percent of all trade volume - doesn't that mean that 85% of trade volume does nothing more than artificially lift the market price of securities? It creates a constant upward pressure in the market.  If HFT disappeared tomorrow and 85% of trades went away, and 85% of the buying low and selling high went away, without that upward pressure, wouldn't those artificially high prices crash?   I haven't done business with them since they spent 4 months sitting on an order, and when it finally shipped, it was the wrong parts (sent a 1ghz amd chip instead of an intel chip, and sent the wrong mobo).   Yup. But just because they have no fault doesn't mean all divorces are no fault. If you cheat, are abusive, do drugs, are an alcoholic, or (in some states) refuse to have sex your spouse can still get an at-fault divorce.  No fault is for when both parties agree to call it quits. Maybe theyre fighting, the magic is gone, they got married in vegas, whatever. Any amicable reason.  Whether the divorce is at fault or no fault can influence things like alimony payments, triggered clauses in prenups, etc.   Please do!! I'm interested to see how they turn out!   Burger purists will disagree with me, but I usually make a panade. For every 4 burgers worth of meat - I like ground chuck - take 1 piece of grocery store sandwich bread mixed with a tablespoon of milk and mash together to make a paste. Work this into the meat. It will help you retain moisture so you don't end up with dry burgers for folks who like them well done.  Shape the patties the day before you're going to use them, and put some dalmatian seasoning on them (coarse salt, fresh cracked black pepper), and let them rest for a day in the fridge.  Get your grill blistering hot, and do about 2 minutes on each side. That should give you a medium well burger. Go shorter if you prefer rarer burgers, but remember unless you're grinding it yourself, ground meat from the store isn't the safest thing to work with. If you grind it yourself, you could do about 1min on each side for a medium rare burger.   So would that be the key difference between nebulae and gas giants? The solid core causes the gasses to coalesce and gather together, and eventually they are dense/hot enough that the core can melt away and they stay stable?   Ahhhh ok, so different Selmer than Conn-Selmer :) That explains why I hadn't seen them before!  Darn, I was hoping she could dangle some promise of business for a discount :-P   Yeah, I caught that. I was more saying that at least some punitive measures have precedent. It doesn't feel like a huge stretch that punitive measures could be placed on the 3rd party if they were aware that they were in fact the 3rd party.   If the 3rd just met someone at a bar who held themselves out as single, then it's kind of screwed up to hit them with those measures. But if they were aware, it actually would make logical sense because that person knowingly damaged the marriage, and is causing the affected partner to be deprived of marital benefits.  I could really see it being argued both ways I guess.   Wow, that's beautiful!  I honestly never knew Selmer made guitars... I'll have to ask my wife to check it out when she visits there later this year (they're running a bootcamp on instrument repair/sales dog and pony show for music educators).   How the heck did you fit in that potbelly pig costume!? It's so lifelike!   Took mushrooms. Complete and utter lack of giant mutant turtles. Very dissapointing.   killykilly-killysmallgirl killykilly-killysmallgirl killykilly-killysmallgirl... what the Stannis did   In most cases in the US, if adultery is committed it is automatically an at-fault divorce. While not all states would let you sue, you're basically guaranteed alimony because of the at-fault status. Basically the court realizes you got screwed over and will back you up.   That is absolutely awesome advice! Thank you! :)   Thanks so much for the suggested subreddits! We have told my wife's parents, but not mine (personality wise, its best to go that route in our opinion).  In a previous relationship, my ex-fiancee had a miscarriage after we had told everyone in the 1st trimester, so I am planning to hold off on telling anyone until we are sure it is sticking around. Good point though - I will talk to my wife about it to make sure we are on the same page about it.   Hey! Thanks for commenting even though the mods removed the post. She is going to start taking them in the next week or two, with the plan for us to start trying in august.   First, I hope this is the right sub. I haven't gotten a response posting this on /r/AskReddit, so I figured I'd give this a shot. I am just wondering what I am doing wrong or right. I also want to know if there is anything in my plans that I'm not considering.  My wife and I are planning to "start trying" near the end of this summer. My wife has started taking prenatal vitamins at the recommendation of her OBGYN, and she'll be going off BC in late july. I know that timing things can be difficult, but she is a teacher and if we could aim for a due date around the end of may/early june, that would be fantastic because it would maximize her time at home.  We are setting aside a half year's take home pay for her now while we have it, so the money can just sit there and earn interest until it is needed so she can take a leave of absence for half the year, possibly the full year.  I am trying to plan for everything that would be needed, whether or not we are successful. My wife has some thyroid issues, so not having success is absolutely a possibility. We have made a promise to ourselves that we will not seek out any fertility treatments if they are necessary, and we will instead adopt.  We have set up physicals for each of us next month to ensure we are in good health, and that neither of us has an unknown health issue that could impact our decision to proceed.  Thankfully we both have insurance and stable jobs, so that is good.  We'll be redoing our guest bedroom to turn into a nursury/kid's bedroom.  Once I have the ability I want to open a upromise and a 529 account, but I think we have to wait until the kid has arrived before that's possible.  Basically - am I overthinking this? Am I doing things just right? Are there any big considerations I am missing? Are there any moms out there who had bad thyroid issues but were still able to conceive? What kinds of difficulties might we encounter that someone who hasn't been through this before would never think to expect?   My first guitar was a $1k Kremona classical. I totally felt unworthy of it, and still kind of do. Hearing a professional classical guitarist make it sing, and then knowing my clumsy hands can't come anywhere close right now, I feel like I'm limiting the guitar. I know I will grow into it though.   Hm, this may be a perfect candidate for the small hydro setup I am putting in our basement then. It lets me keep a good eye on everything. Thanks!!      I had had a cultivar called "Gypsy Bell" awhile ago which was similar, but not nearly as sweet or as small as these little guys. I wish I could figure out what the exact cultivar is.  Any idea which one you have been using? Or is it just "mini bells"?   Hey everyone. My wife and I have been picking up bags of mini sweet bell peppers at our grocery store.  This is what they look like: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_s--n1TR94Vs/TTxjcyzOLzI/AAAAAAAAQ-E/kgWZaTBznHU/s1600/sweet-mini-peppers-400x400-kalynskitchen.jpg  They're sweet, and super snackable. They also come with a couple seeds in each, and I was considering trying to grow them.   However I haven't been able to find much information about them. Has anyone else tried growing them from seed? Are the seeds viable? Are they a hybrid? Would I just end up with a normal bell pepper?  I don't know much about the base cultivar so any help would be very much appreciated.   I'm waiting for the tread watch to come out. Yeah the price sucks, but the time savings for me makes it worthwhile.  At work I am constantly moving between buildings doing server work, and I almost always forget one tool that I need, which leads to 30-60 minutes of moving back and forth between buildings to get the tool I need. Always having it on my wrist would be more or less priceless for me. Sadly a normal multitool isn't allowed (have to walk through multiple metal detectors and they count them as a knife).  I just wish you could get the band without the timepiece, because I'd pick up something I like a bit more than the timepiece they include in the watch.      I have always promosed myself that if my kid comes out to me, my reaction will be "so what? Why do i care where you mash your naughty bits. Lets go get tacos."  Also, I really fucking love tacos.   This is weird. I work at a telecom, and I handle a lot of the records folks like the NSA are interested in. Everything is in UTC always, specifically to prevent timezone crap from popping up.   This is true, with one exception (to my knowledge). The executor can take a salary out of the estate before any creditors (they have to be paid for their time as they are providing a service, and without that service no one gets paid, not even the creditors).

Most of these describe him to a T - except he and is wife are quite happy, and he doesn't drink or do drugs. Not entirely sure how he pulled it off during some of the recent projects.

Basically, you'd be the guy from Office Space who has "People Skills"!   Can you provide any good info sources for building a trading strategy? Just a link or book name would rock.   Hey, thanks for the response to OP. I am in the "book lernin before jumpin in" stage right now. Can you provide a bit more information about the pattern day trader rule?   Sales engineers are usually paired with an actual salesman. Basically you interface directly with a customer alongside the salesman, and formulate a design to meet the customer's needs. Additionally, you prevent the sales guy from selling things that don't exist, which they sometimes do just to close the sale. Anyone who has worked as an engineer knows what I'm talking about ("Sure our product can do x!" "Uh, hey engineers, we need you to make the product do x by friday because we told the client we could do it.")  So, suppose I need a SAN for my company, but I'm not really familiar with SAN hardware. I'd talk to the sales guy and say "Hey, I need to talk to one of your storage guys so I can figure out exactly what I need." At which point the sales engineer pops up. He would figure out exactly what I was looking to accomplish, what my needs were, and then design a solution for me that meets those needs. That designed solution is what I would purchase from the vendor then. Often the sales engineer may also be my first step for fielding minor questions about support on that solution (usually for one off questions, not anything major that would require tracking).  The same thing would happen with software development, or any type of contracted engineering really. It's engineering, but with a sales spin to it.   You should go into sales engineering. Twice the profit, half the work.   I heard in this addition the speaker will actually tell you about all the things he could tell you about!   A lot of beef's cheapness depends entirely on how close you are to a processing plant. For instance, in my area, beef is absurdly expensive compared to poultry and pork. Most of it gets shipped in from the western half of the country, so it tends towards ridiculously high prices. For instance, a beef chuck in our area averages about $5.99/lb (USD) and up.  I can get a pork boston butt for about $2.99/lb.   Especially since, given a lot of the newer details, this was a free pool party that had flyers printed up advertising it and placed around town. The black kids appear to have been getting harassed by some suburban white folks who were angry about them being there, telling them to "go back to their section 8 housing."  So, asshole cop would have realized he was victimizing victims if he would have bothered to investigate. Not that he gives a damn, he got to beat up some negro kids. I'm sure the Fraternal Order of Police will try to give him a medal and ensure he goes back to work with full backpay, and all of those "good cops" that everyone claims exist will of course just continue to happily pay their union dues instead of saying "fuck that, this guy needs to be fired if you want to see another cent from me you won't try meddling in due process." Because maintaining professionalism only matters on paper.   And this is the golden reason why the police and the military are separate professions, and why you don't ever want to mix the two. Soldiers are trained to kill the enemy - that's their job, follow orders, and kill whoever the rich people say are the bad guys.  Police are public servants. Their job is literally to serve and protect. The only time they are supposed to kill or threaten to kill is when it is necessary to serve and protect the public.  When you start treating police like they are soldiers, equipping them like soldiers, and telling them that the public is the enemy, you have a big damn problem.   I think it's a mix. He grew up in an environment where every single person around him has aims to ascend to the throne, and they don't care if they kill everyone else in the family. So, he knows he has to be a nasty sonuvabitch to keep the dogs from running him down. I don't know if it is so much that he is a nasty person, or that he has to act like a nasty person to stay alive himself. The whole thing is farked up.   Thanks! I ended up talking with the receptionist and they basically said they'll have me fill out a questionnaire to get an overview of my medical history, and then just start a new patient file.  Thank you again!   Hey everyone. I'm completely new to using purse.io. I am looking to purchase a 600$ item and was hoping for a 20% discount. It is saying it will be filled in 48 hours and shipping will take 4-5 days.  Does that mean it will absolutely be filled within 48 hours? Or does it mean that if someone takes the offer they will have to purchase the item within 48 hours?   Hey everyone, as mentioned, my last checkup was about 13 years ago before I started college. My wife and I are discussing having a kid, and as a pre-step I wanted both of us to go in for a checkup to make sure there's nothing negative we need to be aware of.  The problem is, in the years since my last checkup my old PCP has retired and his office closed. I know when you move to a new PCP you usually have your medical records transferred over, but in this case I have no idea who owns my medical records now to have them get transferred over.  What should I do? If I go to the new doctor, can they just start new medical records for me?   I live near a large University. The rich kids who go there buy tons of stuff during the school year, and then at the end of the year throw it all out so they didn't have to lug it back home.  This ended up attracting shittons of scavengers, myself included. Everything you could imagine - TV's, tables, coffee machines, bongs, kitchen equipment, bicycles, video game systems, and more. Hell, one year we found a wheelchair.  The one of the college profs saw what was going on and decided to work with the city to make an event out of it and it's basically a massive yard sale now. It took care of it on a wide scale.   Dude, big props to you.   So how does this service know your address? Do they ask you the first time you place an order? His orders all omit that.   http://i.imgur.com/BbgL7x3.gif   In Philadelphia there is a bar called "12 Steps Down" which is, cooincidentally, under street level and requires you to go down 12 steps.

I've never crated a dog, even when our labs were in the puppy chewing stage (we just did our best to puppy proof). I think folks rely on it too much. I'll probably get rated down for posting that (this sub seems to be obsessed with crates sometimes).  Unless they're making a mess, "leaving presents," or chewing I just wouldn't worry about it. Just do your best to keep the dog on a schedule to help avoid most of those things.   Still waiting for evidence that they were bred solely for bloodsports. Considering bloodsports were almost entirely in the south, good luck.  You're the one trying to prove a negative here, not me.   Why not skip the crate? Has he performed any behaviors that show one is required?   If you have a teacher, you may want to check out the book series "sight reading for classical guitar". The books are built around learning how to read all of the nuanced symbols of classical guitar music.

Show some citations or stfu.   Reread what I wrote. Per the ASPCA:   As the "sport" of dog fighting developed, enthusiasts bred a lighter, more athletic canine. These dogs made their way to North America, the ancestors of today's pit bulls. Pit bulls that were not used for fighting were considered ideal family petsaffectionate, loyal and gentle with children.  https://www.aspca.org/fight-cruelty/dog-fighting/pit-bull-cruelty   Maybe you could find gainful employment as an Imperial Trooper?   They were bred for bear baiting, not dog fighting. Still bloodsports though, so your point stands.  Interestingly enough they were also bred to be nanny dogs, but idiot breeders have kinda screwed the pooch on that one.   It may not help much, but the vast majority, 94%, of reported pitbull attacks come from unneutered males.

I provide cited evidence for what I say and I still get downvoted.    Honestly they are just as lazy when they're young (when they're pups they are spazzy though). They have the same physical build and mannerisms as cheetahs and run almost as fast.  Both of them sleep 20+ hours a day to reserve all of their energy for the one or two times they need to run down prey. They can burn an absurd number of calories in 1 minute because of how fine tuned their bodies are.  We love our hounds - such amazing dogs. They're so mild mannered and calm... great family dogs so long as you dont have one that was on the track too long (crate and food agrression can be issues).   I personally like Pumping Nylon. My fretting hand especially benefitted. Just be careful to take it slow because it will make your hand sore if you do too much at once.  Plus it has a ton of Andrew York pieces which I really enjoy.  I am also looking at picking up "Sight Reading for Classical Guitar" but I have been told to only use it with a teacher.      Luckily we have the cash on hand to make the purchase without too much hesitation. It's not "nothing" but it's also not enough to make us uncomfortable. Hooray for agressive budgeting!

As of last night I am lvl 31, and with Xr, I could be higher by the end of the weekend (hoping to get both the saint 14 helm, and if I get super lucky collecting strange coins, the MIDA multi tool).  I have just been playing by doing daily bounties and strike playlists. Since I broke lvl 30 I started receiving constant messages from other players about raids, but I don't have any experience so I'm hesitant to say yes.  So, what do I do next? I'd rather play with a dedicated group of people, but none of my friends are playing on PS3. I've tried joining guilds on the Bungie site, but it's not really clear how to interact with them once you've joined. I've felt uncomfortable using destinyLFG because I really don't like playing with folks I don't know or at least have some connection with (like being in the same guild). Plus the stories on here about people there screwing over others really don't make me want to check it out. I'm from the MMO world where I could usually hook up with a guild and just roll with them through end game content.  I've been scraping together whatever gear I could to level as a striker titan, though if I can get that helm I'm probably going to switch to defender. Once I get geared up I'll start focusing on tweaking to my playstyle.  Any help would really be appreciated.    REI Kingdom 6  How do you like it? That was one of the other models we were looking at, but my big concern was the lack of ventilation.   Ban high capacity assault knives!   Sadly my wife packs heavy. My concern is a lot of 4 person tents simply don't fit 4 people along with gear. For this trip we will be strictly car camping, however future trips will not. Also, we usually are out with groups of friends, so it isn't uncommon to have 1 or 2 guests in the tent with us.   Hey everyone. My wife and I are going to be spending 2 weeks car camping around the finger lakes next month. We have a cheapo 60$ 4 person tent from walmart that has lasted me for a few years. After several rainstorms I am finding I have to waterproof the tent constantly, which has the side effect of coating us in a puddle of water by the time we wake up in the AM due to lack of ventilation. The wife is justifiably concerned about spending that much time in the tent given we will need more "stuff" for that duration of a trip - it could get kinda cramped. We are also looking at having a kid soon, so we'll need a better tent that can better deal with the haphazard abuse of a child. So, we are looking at getting a new tent.  I started looking around at 6 person tents, and all of them on the low price end seemed to have some big gotchas - lack of ventilation, lack of space, flimsiness, collecting water, easily torn, etc. After looking at a number of the big brands I found the Big Agnes Flying Diamond 6, and the reviews are unanimously positive. But the $600 pricetag has my wife in a fit.   I'm hearing things like "we should have stayed in a hotel room, it would be cheaper." I'm trying to explain that we could theoretically use this thing hundreds of times whereas the hotel room would be a once and done thing, but she's just getting huffy and saying "well, fine, get whatever you want." You married guys know that that means: "DO NOT GET WHATEVER YOU WANT!"  We go camping 2-3x a year, usually I go on one or two additional trips she doesn't because I enjoy the outdoors more. We are in PA, so we have a rather temperate climate and it isn't uncommon for an 80 degree day to yield to a 40 degree night.  It seems like on the low end you have tents that cost 100-200$ but then the price immediately jumps up to 400+ without a ton of middle ground. Since she and I have always gotten cheap tents in the past, we aren't really sure if there is a fitting jump in quality.  She wants to spend at max $200, but my concern is if we are ultimately going to get a higher quality tent (either as an upgrade or to replace one of the cheapos), I'd rather not spend the cash on a low/intermediate quality tent and just jump right to the higher end because it ultimately saves money.  Given the amount of time we spend camping, am I over-preparing? Is this "too much" tent for us? Or is she just fixated on being thrifty in a way that will bite us on the ass later? What sort of difference do you see in tents before and after that price gap?   Really? Thanks for the heads up about this.

A family member of mine has been running campaign after campaign on gofundme, stating that they can't afford their bills, that their medical expenses can't be covered, that they can't afford insurance for their kids, etc. These things are all true.  However, after the last one was run, I started seeing notices that the same family member who was so broke was spending a bunch of cash on kickstarter despite supposedly having -$200 in their checking account. Apparently the same individual has also purchased a brand new laptop, and been buying things like crazy on amazon.  If the people who supported them found out about this, what would the legal consequences be? Would this be fraud, or would it be a civil problem?   Yup, hence the hesitation. Either way, thank you.   Appreciate it, but it sadly isn't an option as they live in my parents' home, and are quickly bankrupting the larger family. And I am my parents' power of attorney.  I can't avoid the issue so easily.   Appreciate it, but it sadly isn't an option as they live in my parents' home, and are quickly bankrupting the larger family. I can't avoid the issue.   Apologies, I didn't see it buried under rule 10. I'll delete the post.   Another friend just pointed this out to me, and I'll be adding both of my library accounts (hometown library and then a state-wide library) to it and see what it looks like! Thanks for the suggestion!!!   In our area that would be a very bad idea. Pennsylvania is notorious for destroying boots, feet, and ankles because of how rocky it is. I'd rather have my full wits about me than try splitting my attention.  I *HAVE* listened when I was just walking on a maintained path, like a canal trail or something though.   Hey everyone. I know recommendations aren't allowed, but I was pretty sure that that only applies to books. So, I'm taking a chance and asking this.  I am considering getting an audible.com membership. I have about 5 hours a day that I spend commuting, 2.5hrs each way) and for years I have been using librivox (for those who haven't heard, it is public domain audiobooks). However at this point it is getting frustrating because I can never seem to find decent narrators.  I was curious what /r/books thought of it. Has it been worth it for you?   FYI, pot is capable of causing latent psychological issues to express themselves. It is acute, and once the effects wear off so do psychological issues.  Seeing someone with undiagnosed schizophrenia get high was one of the most uncomfortable stoner moments of my life.  Ultimately I would recommend OP find a sitter for their first time just to be safe. Even if psych issues weren't in play, I've seen people have major panic attacks from getting high the first time, to the point where they had to go to the ER because they thought they were having a heart attack. I personally also sometimes get bouts where my body feels flush and my heart starts to race - at which point I have to stop whatever I'm doing and focus on my breathing to calm my heart back down. If I wasn't as experienced as I am that could easily cause some major problems.  I'm not saying pot is unsafe, but these things do have remote chances of happening. And Im saying that as someone who has been a regular user for well over a decade. For a completely new smoker, it's better to be safe than sorry. Just have a sitter.  Not like OP will get high their first time anyway (unless they go the edible route) :)   How would this work if there is a dog in the car? Dogs are considered property.  Serious question.    I'm not sure if OP is looking for equivalent phrases (ones which contain every letter of the alphabet/syllabary) or if OP is looking for the exact phrase translated into several languages.   Just opened a ticket! Not sure if it is something geographic or what the deal could be, but i'd be happy to help you guys figure it out.   Kegels for men agogo!   I've noticed that everything I play with pandora, prime, or tunein plays really well. iHeartRadio plays just fine when I initially kick off a station, but after an hour it starts playing extremely choppy, as if it is buffering every few seconds. It makes the station unlistenable. Is anyone else encountering this??  Edit: Seriously, wtf is with the ratedowns in this sub?   Hey everyone. My wife and I are discussing becoming parents, and we have a rough timeline we would love to follow (we are planning for 1 year of trying, and if that fails, adopting). My wife currently brings home about $2600 a month, and we would like her to be able to be a stay at home mom for at least 4.5 months (half of her working year), up to one year.  We currently have the cash on hand to afford this, and want to set the money aside now when we don't need it in an illiquid account to lock it up for at least 1 year. Then, after she takes her FMLA + uses all of her sick time, it should come available to act as a replacement for her paycheck during her leave of absence.  Right now if we were to put it in a savings account at our bank (Capital One 360) we could earn .75% on that money. I have thought of putting it into a 12 month bond, or a 12 month COD. I would really prefer it be illiquid during this time, both for higher interest but to also ensure that we keep our paws off of it in an emergency (we have a normal emergency fund).  So, are there any other options /r/personalfinance can recommend for locking up this cash for 12 months, and garnering a nice helping of interest? Any help would be really appreciated.   Also not good at paying off the right people. A little "gold or death" goes a long way.   Well, one will literally rot your limbs off. The other only has a slight chance of rotting limbs off. Probably better to go with the one that is less likely to rot your limbs off.   Hey everyone. I am still rather new to guitar - I've been playing for about 1 year, and I want to start learning to improvise at least a little bit.  I know most improvising is built off of scales, and the recommendations I've read have suggested either starting with minor pentatonic scales, or blues scales.  Is one better than the other to start with? Are there any really good exercises or books I could check out?   I have a LXME which is essentially the same as the LX1E, except the 1 has a spruce top and the ME is all laminate. It is a nice sounding little guitar! Big sound in a little body. I wanted all laminate so I could take it camping, vacationing, throw it around a car, have a toddler knock it over, and leave it sitting out in the open in our den, ALL without having to worry about humidity or temperature impacting the instrument. It has done swimmingly at all of that. Also, I LOVE the stock tuning machines. They're very tight and responsive, almost too responsive. It's very different from my classical.  The biggest cons I have found:  * Switching back and forth between a classical guitar and the 3:4 little martin is trying, especially with pudgy fingers. I have a hell of a time going back and forth. If you are used to playing full sized guitars, especially classicals where your fingers have a little room on the fretboard, you may want to try out the little martin first. So, be prepared to always sound a little folksy :) * The built in tuner is off by about 30 cents (about 1/3rd of a semitone), and I have no idea how to recalibrate it. The electronics came with no documentation. It's essentially unusable currently. This is easily fixed by a $8 snark tuner, so it isn't huge. I haven't tried the pickups yet so I have no idea how well it sounds amplified. * I really wish they manufactured them at their Nazareth location. I live about 10 minutes away from their HQ, and would love to see them employing even more locals. On the upside, it keeps my friends who work in their custom shop well employed I guess :) * Compared to my full sized classical, it weighs a ton. It's surprisingly heavy for its size.  I'll echo everyone else - go into a store where you can try a bunch of guitars out. If you really love the little Martins, you want to try playing both the LX1E, the LXME, and the LXK2 (I think that's what the Koa one is called). Surprisingly I think the LXME sounds the best out of all of them despite being plastic.  I have heard a lot of really negative talk about the Ed Sheeran signature sounding very thin, so I would especially play before you'd pick up that one.   Little martins are just fine for campfire playing, actually :) I'd avoid Martin backpackers at all cost though. Even though they're both made outside the US and they're both fantastic plastic, the backpacker just sounds bad.   I know about 10 years ago Catty had a lot of petty crime problems. Has that improved? I haven't heard anything negative for a few years so it would be great news if it has gotten better.   FYI, at least in PA, having a job doesn't have any bearing on whether or not you have to pay support. This loophole was closed a very long time ago because a deadbeat parent could quit their job and then claim that they aren't bringing in any money, so they shouldn't be liable for support. Obviously, this was an easily exploited problem.  So now your support obligation is based off of your employable worth, not whether or not you are currently earning it. So, if you have a job earning 65k, and then lose it or quit, your support obligation will still be based off of that 65k because at least in theory you could get another job earning a similar wage. While it sucks if you lose your job, at the same time, your kid doesn't stop needing support just because you are now jobless.  Again, this is valid for Pennsylvania as of about 8 years ago, so it may vary by state.   Sadly Bungie doesn't do very much to stop it.   I opened a ticket about an hour ago after I noticed some weirdness. I asked Alexa to play my "BB King station on Pandora". It then tried t find a pandora station for "R B for Kings and Queens," and then apparently found a matching station on iHeartRadio. Destiny's Child started playing, and the thrill was gone for me.  I checked the app and verified that it heard me say "BB King" in the app. It just seemed like after the request was made, somehow on the backend it wasn't processed correctly. So, I opened a support ticket just to let them know.  About 5 minutes ago I got a response that Amazon had received my ticket, they had already tested it on one of their test units and verified that there is an issue, and it the developers were notified of the issue.  All within 1 hour.  Holy hell, I work in product R D and we can't manage that kind of turnaround time for our customers.  	145

 No, but I've been meaning to try it out. I've heard it's a really good time.    I never imagined that this happened in other places.   Here is the newspaper archive from the day the lot collapsed :   http://newspaperarchives.vassar.edu/cgi-bin/vassar?a=d d=miscellany20070223-01.2.4   I try and post some things that I happen to come in contact with while living here. Like you said, I never see anything from the area!   SERIOUSLY. I realize now that I probably should have at least stepped outside of my vehicle and took a picture before posting it on reddit with such shit quality.   It gets worse and worse every year, yet everyone still parks there (including myself). Its actually one of the busiest parking lots at the galleria.   I was hoping someone would recognize it, I honestly didn't think anyone would.   Yeah I could understand that. Unfortunately, as I stated, it has already caved in once. It gets worse and worse over the years. Yet people, like myself, still park on the roof.    Sorry for the quality, it's supposed to be the degradation of the parking lot on top of a parking garage. The entire lot has multiple points where it is sinking    Same!!   Hahahah me too! That and Fun Central that used to be down Route 9, I used to get free tokens all the time. It was great.   Bahahahaha you mean that spot in the food court which literally every store that has been there has ceased to exist? Maybe they are bitter assholes because they lost their business!  	11

That means that there are other teams just as hungry as we are that have gone through the same thing and are finally making it to the top  (hawks, grizz, warriors, etc). It takes years to make it,  some teams don't even make it.  Let's appreciate we at least have a classy organization that prides itself on winning and resiliency. We were a 15 win season not to long ago then won a couple titles afterwards. Our job is to support our team despite the record.  Period.

Listen to Mac Demarco. Do it. Do it. Do it.      That is exactly how I reacted.   oh another thing i wanted to say about For the Kids is that the letterboxing really adds to the cinematic feel. Looks great! I think I want to do that on my next film instead of the basic ass 16x9.   I'm not sure of the exact model, but our cinematography used a camera slider for most of the better looking shots. Google it, there are even some cheap DIY builds. Also a shoulder mount    ay, thanks dude. worked hard on it :-)   Check out the film I posted on here, Simplicity, when you have time. It's not quite as funny though. Or at all. In fact it's rather depressing.   Haha this was awesome. Love the twisted sense of humor.      Yo, this is a pretty dope shirt! Where did you get them if you didn't make it?   "You're history."  man i hope that line is in jurassic world.   Contact is my favorite alien film!! :-)   It's not *that* far out, but Hitler and the Occult is a pretty interesting short documentary that talks about Hitlers religious beliefs. It's kinda cool. It gives you the impression that Hitler truly thought that he was a messiah of some sort.   Sorry. I didn't know my opinion would get downvoted. I just get the feeling that Kanye cringes every time he hears that song. It's a product of its time.    RAMPAGE EDITION   Ahh! The one on the left was one of my favorite toys growing up! Oh man, the nostalgia is hitting so hard. Thanks OP   Came here to post these exact words. You're cool.   Ah man, that reminds me that I'm actually banned from fat people hate.   I seriously hate Stronger. It's the only Kanye song that I really dislike. Sadly, it's the only Kanye song that I ever seem to hear on the radio and it drives me crazy.   Damn, that was beautiful.  	27

The gas station by my house where I usually get gas was $3.19 a gallon last week. Now it is $3.89.   Didn't see it was in Canada. In the US they are cruel scams to trap poor people in  never-ending cycle of debt.   As I see gas prices rise 50 cents a gallon overnight, I have to ask who is controlling this crap? What excuse are they using now?   Refinery problems? Employee strike? Or some other lame excuse that they pull out of their ass.   Edit: Must just be in So Cal. No matter what problems we have had in the past, never have they risen  50 cents overnight.

No.   https://imgflip.com/i/o5mem          You mean especially redditors can be fooled.   15 years ago that would have been true.

 Tom Cruise in Collateral (2004)   The Last Of US.      Cafe Kino on Gloucester Road.   Plus the companies who they attacked will probably sue them for causing their servers to go offline.....or hire them.   Thank god someone mentioned this, such a terrific film with a really interesting script and intriguing characters despite most of them not being visible.  We had the producer come and introduce it to us at uni and told us some fun facts about the film. Apparently the script was wrote between Boxing Day and New Years and was pretty much the final draft. It was also a 5 day shoot that entailed Tom driving around the same intersection with a camera strapped to the bonnet of the car. The other actors spoke to him whilst sat in a hotel reading through their lines.    I really hope David Batista only speaks literally throughout his challenge.   These are great....however I do not want to see his interpretation of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe.   I see the Kill Bill saga Tarantino's homage to Asian films. The first one features about 50 direct references to other films that inspired him across his career while Volume 2 is the western influence of these films. It is all shown in this video that shows these references. https://vimeo.com/19469447 Tarantino has always said he is more of a film lover then a film maker which I respect from him and adds more context to this film as it is often seen as one of his most misunderstood films.    *"This is a stick-up"*  	10
 Thanks so much everyone!   I'm working on a shoot in August that has a pretty intense pool scene and Post guy and I thought it might be cool to capture some underwater sounds. That being said, I have no idea what that might sound like, or how I would go about capturing it. I did some research, but I thought I'd ask some of the Pros. What do you all think?   DMP looks awesome! Thanks for the suggestion!   Could you post the code or the program you made? That is awesome!  	4
 I guess you got me there...^^   red sauce (on the beef) : i made caramel and deglazed it with vinegar and worcestersauce added some ketchup and let it cook briefly and season with green pepper.   the white sauce (for the salad) : just mix mayonaise,   rough-textured mustard, salt, vinegar, white pepper.     yeah but hey i made the bun !  	3
 There is a sample of each on the Fallout wiki.  Edit: Source ~ http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Gary_%28clone%29   Found under notable quotes.

Edit: Source ~ https://youtu.be/DqQqeEgWb7Q?t=8m45s   I'd also recommend playing Fallout 3 as supposedly there will be references from Fallout 3 placed into Fallout 4.   People have been complaining that they can't get a Pipboy Edition because scalpers have been buying them up and then selling them for at least double their original price; some going for around $300.

After my many hours on Payday: The Heist and Payday 2 I've be conditioned to keep my eye out in buildings for the security guards and cameras.   I got to the point where there were roughly a thousand+ misc items outside the entrance to Whiterun. If you looked directly at it, your game would crash.   Though I enjoyed it, I found it to be too linear and restricting, you don't have to work out different ways to solve puzzles, but have to do that one specific thing.   Fallout 4 trailer just came out.... hype is real.   Yet less cars.   These are some really cool ideas, I love em'.   I recently stopped playing DayZ and have been thinking of getting back into it, but I just find the lack of goals to be boring. What do you guys do to stop yourself from getting bored, aside from playing with friends.   Warlords?   Depends on the game, but in some games e.g. Battlefield, you should never reload prematurely unless you are 100% sure it's safe, because you could always walk into somebody whilst reloading.   Why is it, that a person's hair/facial hair can go grey, but their eyebrows tend not to? Or is it just the people I've seen and they do normally go grey?    Sorry I chose that wording, I was playing LoL at the time so I didn't double check it etc.   Or they could encourage donations and support through that, instead of making me pay $2+ for a minigame that let's me go fishing....  	18
 doh!   So this duck walks into a drugstore and gets a pack of gum.  The cashier says, "That'll be $1."  The duck says, "Just put it on my bill."  The next day, the duck comes back and gets a pack of condoms.  The cashier says, "That'll be $5.  I suppose you want me to put them on your bill."  The duck says, "No thanks, I'm not that kind of duck."      Bless her heart!   I see what you did there.            So Captain America is left-handed?         21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.  22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.  23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.  24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

Still, quite an interesting read, piqued my curiosity and now lots more research to do. :D   I'd much prefer to date a fellow ace, purely personal preference, but if I did fall for someone, I wouldn't turn them down or cut off my own love just because they were sexual.  My libido is very low, to the point where I could honestly go the rest of my life without sex and probably not really care.   (Sorry I took so long replying! - Had to go pick my sister up from the pub)  Congrats! I know a few Trans people, and they're looking forward to the OK on the HRT.  I've had a few "Eh?" and "Seriously? Isn't that the self reproduction thing?" and my sister said "Oh, so you're just not into relationships at all then?"  But nothing hostile, and when I went to a Brony meet a few months ago and the topic of sexualities came up in the post-meet-pissup, the fellow I was talking to was quite.. excited to meet an Asexual person, as he'd never met any before! Which was quite refreshing   Sexuality is a fluid thing - for all any of us know, in a few years, we could be sexual  But, to answer your question - maybe. HRT is a hormonal crazy time, are you currently going through the treatment?   I'd heard the term "Asexual" before, but I didn't think much of it - mostly in biology classes - Asexual reproduction. Of course when I saw people referring themselves as Asexual, I just waved it of as internet craziness.  Then I saw Jenni's BBC article - which is the Asexuality we refer to ourselves as, and I was pretty much ".. Damn, that sounds like me"   Yes, most definitely. Nothing better than being curled up on the sofa with the one you love, just chilling the night away, talking about whatever and just taking pleasure in each other's company.  An ideal relationship for me..  Hard to imagine.. For me, someone to come home to, tell them about my day, share a meal, talk a bit more, snuggle in bed.. I can't ask for any more than that!   For me, I was at work - I used to work checkouts at a clothes store - I had some other colleagues working with me, and every time an attractive woman walked past, they always checked out "dat ass"  Maybe I just wasn't into women, I thought. Was I gay without realising? A few more weeks passed. Nothing. I felt nothing for anyone..   But then I met my girlfriend, fell for her after a few months of knowing her as a good friend. We lasted a year before the distance killed it, but all the time - even when we met - I never once thought "I want to do the horizontal dance right now".. I was quite content to just sit on the sofa with her, cuddle, kiss and watch TV.  Cut to last year, I'm lurking on the BBC news site, and I see Jenni and Tim's article. "Hey, that sounds a bit like me.."   Evening!  I'm train_subject8542, Demiromantic and based in the UK (It's midnight here!) I'll be here all night, I hope, and while "new" to the Asexual scene, I've been Asexual most of my life.   I got my typin' mode on!   Damn! And I just sent my phone back for repair.. :(  But yeah, I used to work shipping/receiving and it was always nice opening a box with a little baggie of skittles or something attached.  Even if you don't get anything extra back, it's always nice to brighten up someone's day.   Oh, neat. I just started a trial account the other day. I'ma come lurk on chat before I head to bed..   Bolton's a bit shit, not much goes on here. Half the town is shut, and it's a bit scary walking down Manchester road at night.  I think the only thing interesting about the place is this little tidbit:  In 1651 the Earl of Derby was executed for his part in the Bolton Massacre outside the Man and Scythe  Also, another fun fact: I live 2 minutes down th' road from The "Phoenix Club", which I promptly clip people around th' lug'oles, and say "It's the St Gregory's club, you prick."  But I do quite like our accent.   You didn't even capitalize the I either.  You're a monster!    What's done is done, the past can't be changed. Let it flow under the bridge and let's hope both parties learn from the experience.  That's how I do with life.      23 year old Male, Demiromantic.  Up for it! Depends on time though, I'm free 9pm GMT up until about 3am GMT.   Yeah, I remember it now. Proper pain in the arse. Wakka, Lulu and Yuna's summons were my best friends in that fight.  Also, Haste.   Was that the giant undead version of the boss, or just the normal?  IIRC, you could just use Yuna and cast Life, or chuck a Phoenix Down at him   Too Human.  I spent 5 hours playing that game.. Every time I died, the resurrection animation took at least 2 minutes. When you're getting pissed off with a boss and that god damned fucking angel comes from the sky to grab you, then drop you off a 5 minute run away, you get frustrated every time that bitch comes down from the sky  Otherwise, I thought it was quite fun, I just couldn't stand the delay of getting knocked out of the fight, before being able to take control of your character again.   I was the same.   Went from Fox, to Dragon, to a different dragon, to another different dragon, back to the first dragon, and now I'm a Lynx. Give it a few years and I'll probably be a Dragon again or something.  Go with the flow, do whatever! :D   While not the same, I went to a similar convention with no plans whatsoever. It was a first-time con, but it had still sold out.   I did a lot of milling about, hugging suiters and just chilling with beers and watching panels.  Don't worry about it. Go in, do whatever. That's what they're for!   The only two I've done are the /r/snackexchange and the /r/mylittlepony ones (2011 and 2012 respectively)  Neither giftee seemed to give me a hard time over where I posted.. All depends on the person you get! Heck, you could even get a fellow fur!   Aiight.  [Lynx attack go!](http://puu.sh/239p9)   The worst I personally encountered was on a friend's stag-do  We booked the field with an events company who run open days there. We had about 30 people with us, so we had the place to ourselves - it's a woodland.  Anyway, we're playing, and everyone's having a laugh, but repeatedly, we'd been telling one of the guys to "Take your damn hits" - At one point, I was stood next to the guy and I could hear the bbs bouncing off his gear.  I'd had it - but the Stag's brother got to him before I did. He snuck up closer and closer, peppering him on full auto with a G36.  He only shouted "Hit!" after a solid minute of being peppered. He was wearing goggles - his face had a few cuts.  He was being a dick through the entire day. Not taking hits, aiming for the head and generally not giving a shit for his or anyone else's safety.   Also, there's ConFuzzled this year which is in Leicestershire, which isn't too bad for me, but Northern Scotland might be a bit of a trek.. There's never much in the way of UK fur stuff, maybe apart from local meets.   Alas, just a few hundred miles to the south of you. :(   Nice to find a fellow UK fur though! :D   Yeah, was jus' gonna say myself. Go look at "___ Goes to the Dentist" vids on youtube. Some of the inane babble some of them talk is _really_ funny.   Bit late, but this is my favourite when I hit the motorway:  [Blue Stahli - Let's Go](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lREZy9LBsKI)   Poop jokes are hilarious (Englishman on late shift. :D)   You get laughed at? Damn.. Whenever I tell people, I just get "Huh, interesting. Well, whatever."  I have had the odd giggle, but what can they do about it?   To be fair though, I stopped caring years ago. I have ponies sat on top of my monitor, I have the asexual flag on the back of my car. I am what I am and I ain't changing for no-one, nor am I hiding it.  It's hard to "Let go", but it's probably the best thing I did. Heck, if you don't make a big deal of it, no-one cares. If the topic comes up, mention it. People are more likely to take it in stride and roll with it.   Yeah.. I always say Asexual first to let them know I'm not just a weirdo - it's a legit orientation!  Then I say I'd rather be hugging on the sofa or playing laser quest or walking in the park with people.  [](/octshrug)   Oh, neat!  It still wigs me out a little when people post about Asexuality when they're not Ace themselves. Everyone else I've ever tried to explain it to were like "what-sexual?"   [](/spitfuck)   You just beat me to it, fellow ace! :D   It's the granite top, there's glittery parts in there.       There's one game I've conjured up so far for my fictional race, the Feln: Coinsies  Based on an old schoolyard game I used to play back when I went to school.  **Coinsies**  A target is drawn on the floor, close to a wall. This game can be played with as many people as you like, as long as you can find your coin amongst the mess!  Competitors take turns flicking a coin at the wall, trying to get it to land in the centre of the target by bouncing it off the wall. Best of 3 wins the round, and a game normally lasts for 5 rounds  Its origins were back in the Lon empire, in the early 2100 years.. It's very much hard to play is the present day, mostly due to coins being taken out of circulation and digital currency being used globally. People still hold onto old coins, or make their own - just to play the game.  --  (Still early days yet, so this is the only one I have so far)   I've known for a while - since I was 18? maybe 17 - I've only recently heard of Asexuality.. I'm 23 in a few days  Until then, I thought there was something up with me, or my friends were greatly exaggerating their desires.   Add me if you want - though I'm not very talkative. Talk to me otherwise I'll be sat there on your contact list doing nothing :  train_subject8542   You're all stealing my cat!  Give me my cat back! [](/vswhathefuck)   We are almost Birthday buddies!

Luckily, the department I'm in now has 2 of us who are pretty handy with technicals.   But how do you break a memory slot? Yeesh - I thought the RAM stick itself would break before the slot would.   Selling seems a bit extreme to me. If people asked nicely, I used to mock up quick character designs for them based on a personality or a race they wanted.   Sometimes, no matter how hard people try, trying to create a character just completely eludes them     Same. I was trying to work towards opening one last year, but I just couldn't drum up interest, investors nor funds.   No idea, unfortunately.   Mine's pretty much the lowest it can be, I'm guessing. I was getting refused for even Tesco credit cards. It probably can't get much lower than that.   I'm in my "repayment year" - I've dubbed it. Chances are, I won't be applying for credit, rent or anything for a year or two yet. (Still at home)  I'm going to pay off this Payday loan, then clear off my credit card. then slowly start building up some savings. I was stupid in my teens and kept digging too deep buying gadgets and useless stuff.   They've frozen interest, but if I can't keep up with repayments (which I can) and I tick over 2 days of agreed dates, I have to pay the rest with interest.   Nah, I got on that slippery slope and last month, I finally tipped over the edge of not earning enough to pay what I owe them.  Rang up and said "Guys, can't afford this shit. Repayment plan?" "Sure thing"  Got it set up, and I'll be clear by May.   I'm stuck in it now.. Few months and I'll be out.  Luckily Wonga are nice enough to set me on a repayment plan without any arguments!

       Enjoyin' a good paid poop in the work restroom. From the sound of his voice, probably a gay, black man starts pooping in the stall next to mine and starts asking me the most awkward series of questions in the most awkward situation imaginable. "Sooooo how are you?" "How old are you?" "Are you a virgin?" "Are you gay?" Noped out of there as quickly as possible.    Weirdly tangential story. I was friends with the animator for Waterman early on in the series run. We had both gone to school overseas since we were both Navy kids. My friend went off too college back in the states and I was a senior in high school a few months from leaving myself. One day I get an AIM message from Bryan Waterman, who I was a big fan of at the time along with other flash shows like Tomorrow's Nobodies, asking me to go to my friend's house to retrieve flash files for the DVD release of those episodes and some files that were going to be used on a movie he was working on. I didn't have a car at the time so I had to bike a couple miles to my friends place, then walk back with entire desktop PC precariously balanced on my bike because my friend's house didn't have Internet at the time and I had to email them to Waterman. This was back in 2005, so quite some time ago. What a weird saga that turned out to be.    Can't have it any other way.

 Too many variables at play to be anything other than coincidence, in my opinion...but i also imagine that the rate of conjoined births is so low, and the factors you are asking about are so subjective, that there is no way to tell for certain.   Anecdotally, that's the mantra, right? Or "Beer before liquor, never sicker"?    Usual causes of hangovers are dehydration, low blood sugar and stomach irritation. I think we can split hairs over the presence of congeners or other "impurities" in gin vs. vodka vs. brown liquor vs. wine vs. beer, but -- by and large -- the key is HOW MUCH you drink...not WHAT.   That is to say, if mixing it up means you drink more high-alcohol content drinks in the same time period, then yes -- you'd probably have a worse headache than if you just stuck to beer. For the most part, though, that's due to the fact that you drank a bunch more alcohol -- not due to the fact you mixed up the types.   Judging by the concentration-response curves I could find with a cursory PubMed search, I would say diphenhydramine is a competitive antagonist at the H1 histamine receptor. It causes a parallel rightward shift in the curve, which is pretty typical of the pharmacodynamics of competitive antagonists. Thus, it seems to interact with the receptor in a similar way to histamine.  That being said, I did find other information that suggests diphenhydramine is actually an inverse agonist: that is to say, it blocks constitutive activity of the H1 receptor (activity present in even in the absence of histamine). So, I imagine that the description as a competitive inverse agonist may be apt here. Or, some allosteric modulation is also happening -- but that is PURE speculation on my part.   My best guess without doing a lot of digging is the relative metabolic demand of the tissues as compared with the blood volume. There is less blood to be pumped (and a much smaller heart to do it), and that creates the issue. For some small animals, a pretty high metabolic demand is present for many tissues. Same reason your heart rate goes up during exercise: think of a chipmunk, bouncing around all the time -- it takes a lot of energy to do that, and thus a high heart rate.   Thus, I imagine the high HR is related to high metabolic demand of the animal's organs and tissues, and the small volume of blood present to carry nutrients to meet that demand...even when docile.  	4

He continually reread the bible while, get this, mapping Hell!    In the literal sense as if was a real place like London or Disney World.    Individual Scientist often believe some strange shit.  What matters is what the Scientific Community on the whole espouses. And in the case of Climate Change, more than 97% believe it's real.    Of the remaining 3%, what you need to ask is how many are crazy outside their field of expertise and how many are paid to believe something else?             /u/nallen is one of the best mods of Reddit.   He knows how to swing the ban hammer when it comes to people who deny scientific facts.    If you deny climate change, evolution or the the germ theory of disease, the mods of /r/Science will jettison you from their subreddit.   They do it because facts are facts.  If you want to make up your own bullshit, then you don't get to play in their sandbox.   It's a great policy for them to have.                 And again, the admins took action.   But by default you want to assume everyone, probably including yourself, is secretly involved in a conspiracy.     And if you are confessing to something, then I think you should get to your confession.    You do a great job at /r/Help.  Thank you very much.     I heard he once killed and ate a jogger.      See, I don't think they are that well spoken.   And they are covered in drool.      It would be helpful if the admins read and responded to things in all the various mod and help-based subreddits.  Including /r/Help, /r/Modhelp, /r/Bugs, /r/ideasfortheadmins, /r/modclub, /r/Modtalk, /r/DefaultMods, and /r/ModSupport.   Plus any I am sure I missed.     For the record, SolInvictus was shadow banned by the admins for breaking the rules of Reddit.  He was removed for being a spammer.   It was clearly not a secret conspiracy or anything.    We should all just thank the Lords of Kobol that the admins used their deep fat frier on him.     Oy vey.  Really, anyone who wants to talk about the greatness of  voat, should just leave for that place.     Yes, there is a discrepancy.    Other than an abstract "what's the way it works", you aren't going to get much more.      From what I understand, same with vote manipulation and brigade detection as well.          In general, based on my personal observations, down votes don't count after about -15.   And there are cases where down votes count for positive comment karma as well.  The day I got more than -3000 down votes on one comment I net earned about 250 comment karma.  There were no corresponding comments that earned +3000 either.                               Ah yes, the various witch hunt threads that never even included half the real story.   You link to a bunch of stuff that is wrong about a whole bunch of things and you don't care about basic facts either.   For example, I didn't get kicked out at /r/Technology, [I quit and told the world why I quit](https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/23p696/meet_the_reddit_power_user_who_helped_bring_down/cgz8ecm?context=3)  As to /r/Europe.... [I said this](https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c0m0a/why_reurope_went_private/csrbiaw?context=3) a few days ago.   Mod leaks showing I was doing the right thing.   The same thing the remaining mods there are continuing to do currently.  Like that guy I am sure basic facts are outside your purview and I'm not going to waste any more of my time talking to you.     I like how you see good supporters of you as people who uses usernames with K.K.K. in them.  [Look at what he mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoonTown/about/moderators).   Which tells the world everything they need to know about you and your so-called friends.  You don't know anything you are taking about.  If you said the sky was blue I would 100% know it wasn't.    I have to say, I'm very disappointed you joined a gang with Qgyh2.   We might need to evict you from the /r/History gang for that.  :-)   Come on, /u/Creesch.   It's obviously that the cabal is ruining the world.   Who is in the cabal?  I'm not exactly sure.     Nobody really ever seems to know what the secret cabal is up too.  From what I can gather I think it has something to do with controlling the coffee futures market.          There is a very simple way to make sure you never get reddit gold, even by accident.   Don't use Reddit.  If you have an account, you can always [delete](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/delete/) it.     I would take credit, but I was only doing what was right.      All Hail the one true DZNeill!   He died and then was risen for all Reddit sins remembered.             Dzneill singlehandedly ran the help-based subreddits for years.   Everything in /r/Help, /r/Modhelp, /r/ideasfortheadmins, etc. was answered by him.    He stopped doing it at one point because.... well, basically back in the day he never got attention from the admins when it was needed.      They just ignored all the good work he was doing for them.   I am still very disappointed in how they treated DZ back then.        I know and have modded with /u/solidwhetstone a bit.  And he isn't the type of person who flexes is e-peen a lot.    He may disagree with fellow mods a lot, but never in a non-productive way.   He has never appeared to be disingenuous to me.    I would be surprised if he reverses himself on this issue.     The Wehrmacht willing joined in committing war crimes and genocide though.    See these AH threads:  * https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1bspmo/how_correct_is_the_notion_of_clean_wehrmacht/ * https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1bidsr/why_wasnt_the_wehrmacht_represented_at_the_wansee/c96yjjp  They're hands were not clean.      Well, it's a [standard thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbsMZecRgbI) I am once again forced to link too.      I used to suggest that Reddit hire you.   You did a lot of great work for this site back in the day.   I still think they should.   But they aren't that smart.     Sorry, but no.     Most of the subreddits that went private are public again.    /r/History, /r/Science, /r/IAMA, /r/AskReddit, /r/Gaming, /r/Art, etc.   That said, you can check out the list of the subreddits you are subscribed to here:  * https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/mine/  You can remove subreddits that may be private from the list on that page.             I removed a shit load of spam.   Things that still need to be removed for being spam.  I do that same thing now at /r/GetMotivated, /r/History, /r/Bestof, /r/Food, etc.   Spam is not a small problem and spam is still spam.    I had done more than 120K spam reports in my time on Reddit.   That's the second most of any mod ever on Reddit.   Only /u/Kylde has done more spam reports.        Considering I didn't remove the threads in question that you complained about before, that should tell you something right now.  But then, as I already pointed out.... you like to ignore actual facts.   In short, they are still being removed; you just choose to ignore it.    Good day to you.      You're still cooler than she is.     Not true.   I was the mod who took /r/History private.   /u/Creesch later put it back online a few hours after /u/Nallen made /r/Science public again.   They were made public again because /u/kn0thing made threads in /r/Modtalk and /r/Defaultmods and seems to be addressing the issues.   Getting his direct attention was the goal.      OF course, the fact that it took several hours to get the attention is still a bit whacked.    People want to make crap up.   But then, they often like to do that because some people are just crazy.     I was removing racist bullshit from here.   Things I continue to remove from other subreddits I mod to this day.   Heck, the thread you guys complained because you thought I remove was **NOT even removed by me**.   It was removed by another mod of /r/Europe who is **still** a mod here.    But I stood by his removal and continue to stand by it.    Removal of that thread was the correct action.  It's still removed at this time.  The current mod team here continues to remove similar threads every day.   Not that you care really, because facts are actually unimportant to you.    Racism and hate are a major problem on Reddit.  We know this because the Users of /r/Europe have said it was a problem. See these threads from /r/Europe on the storm front problem:  * https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1w3fnr/seems_we_are_important_enough_for_stormfront_to/ * https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y0tbb/headsup_popular_neonazi_site_daily_stormer_is/  And it's a problem faced by all of Reddit.   For example, the definitive /r/History comment statement on the problem.    * https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2puapu/alfred_hitchcocks_memory_of_the_camps_very_nsfw/cn0a25e?context=3  The history-based subreddits of /r/History, /r/HistoryPorn, /r/AskHistorians, /r/BadHistory, etc. all ban users for racist and hate-filled opinions every day.  Be they racism, holocaust denial, NeoNazis, NeoConfederates, Pro-Slavery or simple history-fact denial.    World War Two happened, denying it will get you banned for that alone.   And no, the mod teams don't care if you agree with how we mod the subreddits.   If you don't like it, then you are free to unsubscribe at your earliest opportunity.    Back to the issue of subreddits going private, /r/History was taken private after a long discussion among the mod team.  We were the fourth default subreddit to go private.  Only a few minutes after /r/Movies did so.   I was the one who made the setting change to take it private.     We then made it available again after the Admins had made statements in various backroom mod-only subreddits.   /r/Science had already decided that it was time to come back, and we followed suit because the admins will giving the stated mod-issues the required attention.     Others links that explain what was happening follow:  * [OutoftheLoop thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/) * [Subreddit Drama thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bwgjf/riama_set_to_private_over_mod_firing/) * [Bestof Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/3bw7ms/top_mod_of_riama_explains_why_its_been_set_to/)  In short, mods doing their jobs are important for Reddit.   Mod tools have not been updated in several years.   Tools like /r/Toolbox which were created by people like /u/Creesch and /u/Agentlame are stop gap measures that they themselves have asked for the admins to copy their work for the benefit of all communities on Reddit.      I could continue to go on here, but you won't read it and aren't really interested in what I am saying.  But somebody else might be interested in the actual facts, and so I post this answer for them.                  Several default subreddits have gone private at this time.   [This list](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bxjyu/list_of_subreddits_suddenly_going_private/) is being maintained by some people.    So far /r/AskReddit, /r/IAMA, /r/science, /r/History, /r/Movies, /r/videos, /r/Art, /r/listentothis, and a few others have gone private.   Others links that explain what is happening are here:  * [OutoftheLoop thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/) * [Subreddit Drama thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bwgjf/riama_set_to_private_over_mod_firing/) * [Bestof Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/3bw7ms/top_mod_of_riama_explains_why_its_been_set_to/)   Just to make a bit of a public statement about /r/History.     The mod team held a discussion and a super majority of the mod-team was in favor of going private in solidarity with /r/IAMA, /r/Science and the other subreddits.    We are hoping the admins get the message and that this is resolved in a way that we can all live with going forward.     There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .   I've been around for a long time.   But there is the [Team Page](https://np.reddit.com/about/team/) that lists them all.    True dat.    /r/IAMA and /r/Science have both gone dark so far.   Both taken there by their mod-teams.  I am not sure what to do myself, but there isn't much else mods can do other than post a "were really upset by this decision" sticky that would get ignored.     Ignored so well that you wouldn't even know if the admins were aware of it or just not reading their PMs.     When you going to write your "When I was a Reddit admin" book?     /u/karmanaut knows that it's been set to private.     /u/ocrasorm is cool too.     I just tune those people out.   But yeah, that can be stupid.     The reason I have difficulty believing you here is that you have always had a problem in responding to people.  Mods often ask for input from Reddit, and rarely get it.   And this one is a problem that is going to be spread out across dozens of subreddits.     I didn't know he left /r/games or /r/gaming.    I"m sure it was because he thought he didn't have the time to mod them and wanted to let others have the sidebar display space.   Cause he's an upstanding person.     Please, let's not actually go crazy.   Bad decision is just a bad decision.       Well, there are a few others we like.   /u/deimorz and /u/krispykrackers are well liked.    But there are not a lot of admins that regularly talk to users.     Firing may be the wrong word here.   Laid off or let go may be a nicer way to describe it.   I wouldn't want to say she was fired, as that often carries the implication that the person deserved it.   And /u/chooter didn't deserve to be let go.     It wasn't a mod that was fired.  Reddit as a company let an admin  go:  /u/chooter  / Victoria.   She helped set up most of the highly visible AMA threads.   Not just at /r/IAMA but also at /r/Books, /r/Science, /r/Food, etc.     She was a great admin.     Edit:  /r/History has gone private in solidarity with /r/IAMA, /r/Science, /r/Movies and other subreddits now.    Edit2:  /r/AskReddit, /r/Art, /r/Videos, /r/listentothis, and others as well.     Victoria setup several AMA's at /r/Food several times as well.  She was doing a lot of good work for Reddit.                 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH3-Gt7mgyM   Invited.    Well, if anyone wants to volunteer, they should let me know.           Really, the place could use some moderators.   I would be willing to add some people to keep an eye on it and try and do something with it.     I was invited there at one point.   I just do mod mail there.   That said, the top-mod there doesn't do much.  I could add some mods there to keep an eye on things.   I could draft you and /u/Quouar if you wish.                                                                                                     Well, this is new the definitive reddit-link/work on the subject.     The only thing I would add is a quote from former Confederate General James Longstreet, responding to a question asking him what he thought the cause of the Civil War was: "If it wasn't about slavery, then I don't know what else it was about".    But then, Neoconfederate apologists don't care about actual facts.                             I really wish the mods of /r/IAMA would shut crap like that down.    Correct.   Some images of Jesse Jackson with Dr. King [here](http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/01/76/11/516702/5/628x471.jpg) and [here](https://davidmandre.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/martin-luther-king_t3002.jpg).   That would be great.    I would love to see that happen.   Get rid of /r/Coontown, /r/GreatApes, /r/Holocaust, and other racist-hate filled scumreddits.     My sister, who is big into Facebook has never heard of Reddit.   Well, except from when I occasionally mention it while she is going on about how great Facebook is.  The vast majority of Americans just don't care.   That said, there is a semi-important marketing demographic some advertisers like.   Too many Redditors think that makes them important, when in reality it just makes them a target demographic to mine for money.   People still don't really care about them at all.                       You wouldn't have contradicted me if I had worked in a Battlestar Galactica reference.  :-)   Genocide Olympics:  The only winning move is not to play.           	150
 These things are awesome. I find myself using it for a lot more than just my case and keyboard. Blowing crumbs out from appliances in your kitchen... No problem! Lint stuck in your lint trap... No problem! Etc, etc...  Also, the actual DataVac is crazy awesome   It also comes with attachments not shown here. One of which is a ~10" flexible straw that can easily get into the crevices and heatsink fins.  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16896367002    but... that Adam's apple...   A main difference: Surface Pro 3 ships with 8.1 Pro. Surface 3 ships with 8.1.  Pro = Pro   The original Surface DID come bundled with a keyboard, but that ran into some issues. One problem is too many packages for retailers to easily carry. There are 5 different flavors of the Surface Pro 3 and 5 different keyboard colors. That means each retailer would have to carry 25 SKU's instead of 10.   Also, people like choice. I work for Microsoft (disclaimer: all opinions are my own and do not represent Microsoft's stance) and there are many people perfectly content using it without a keyboard as they prefer the pen. It's not like they would have just given the keyboard for free, the whole "package" would have been more expensive anyways, this method just allows users to customize the device to their needs rather than forcing you to purchase items you may not otherwise use.   Go to Office.com and try the Office Online apps. Its 100% Free and 100% compatible with Office. Google Docs was super awesome when it launched as nothing was even similar, but there are several choices now. Plus, Office is now free for iOS and Android.   The Surface Pro 3 and the Surface 3 both use N-Trig instead of Wacom. The button on the back of the pen will instantly launch a new OneNote page, even if the Surface is locked for super quick note-taking.  The actual writing experience between the N-Trig and Wacom is very similar, although the newer pens feel much nicer than the SP1 and SP2 pens.   I have no sources to base this off of, but I believe much of the ivory goes to China and other Asian countries. Most of the campaigns I see are directly marketed towards Western (America, Europe, etc.) Cultures as it is already highly illegal to traffic and there is FAR less demand than there is in certain Asian countries. For all we know, there ARE a lot of anti-ivory, anti-poaching campaigns in Asia.   Mine automatically showed up when I was checking out with a Pantry Box. I'm unaware of a location to actually view your credits.   I believe they expired yesterday :/   I recently went to purchase an item using my Prime membership and noticed that I now had an option of no-rush shipping and in return I got a $5.99 credit towards a Prime Pantry order. I had never heard of Prime Pantry before, so I looked it up, thought it was cool and selected the no-rush option. The next day, I ordered two more items, and selected the $5.99 for each of these items as well.  I now figured I would have ~$18 towards grocery items, so I loaded up a Pantry box and went to check out, just to find that even Prime members still get charged a flat rate of $5.99 per box (either 4 cubit feet or 45lbs) and can only use a single credit towards the order, letting me get free shipping. What's even more frustrating, is each $5.99 credit is only good for a few days and there's no way I'm making 3 separate Pantry orders in the span of a week.   As others have posted, [tablet forms of these are available on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/mberry-Miracle-Fruit-Tablets-10-Count/dp/B001LXYA5Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1427490106 sr=8-1 keywords=miracle+berry)  I've actually thrown "Miracle Berry" parties several times and it's a lot of fun! Just walk around a grocery store and try to think of everything that tastes sour and buy it! Some tips from my experiences... Each tablet will last you about 15-60 minutes (generally about 30 before effects diminish), not ALL the sourness goes away (lemons do not taste like pure sugar), thoroughly dissolve the tablet in your mouth (3-5 minutes) and then wait a couple more for the full effect, and lastly, bitterness is NOT the same as sourness. Eating the lemon peel will still be incredibly bitter.  **Lemons/limes:** Taste like the best lemonade/limeade ever  **Pineapple:** Incredibly delicious, but almost TOO sweet for some people  **Oranges/orange juice:**  Really depends on the kind, but can substantially change the flavor  **Hot Sauce:** Vinegar almost tastes sugary, so it is both sweet and spicy  **Pickled items:** Again, vinegar becomes rather sweet  **Cheese:** Some cheeses taste like "dessert" cheese, especially sharp cheeses, cream cheese, cottage cheese, and goat cheese. Some people don't seem to be as effected by the cheeses as other though.  **Beer/Wine:** Not as profound as citrus, but definitely changes the flavor profile   *Random note of caution: You'll end up wanting to eat a TON of citrus foods. This will give you an upset stomach if you don't moderate.*    TL;DR: Daughters name is "My" and SQL means "Structured Query Language".   You literally just reposted this from /r/videos...     Yea same here. I'm blowing up instantly on all servers, including self hosted servers with just me.   Awesome! Thanks for the review! Ive been looking at the casebudi XL   I'm looking for a hardcase for my K7XX's. There are only 3 cases I've seen on Amazon that are verified to fit them, but I'm wondering what other people use.   I would use these for daily travel (I'm not looking for a locking pelican case or anything) and I'm looking to spend about $20-$40.     As a chinchilla owner... This setup is soo awesome! Looks clean, well made, and super fun for the rats! Great job!  It's too bad my chins would chew through that container in 5 minutes :/   Ohh! Thanks for this! I hadn't even thought to check Amazon :)   You put up with it well... Hopefully the light will come to him!   You may even want to point him to /r/buildapc or similar and see if he can actually learn something :P   I purposely save all silica packets I get specifically for this. I have a shoebox sized Rubbermaid that I spill the little beads into... this has saved many a cell phone.    Why downvotes?! He actually has a "dickbutt" logo on his drill press if you look closely...   Couple of questions: 1. I always choose Quick Match, but there are seldom people on... Is there a different server I could be using? 2. The other day, as soon as I spawned, my plane exploded. Not sure if the server was at its limit, this was a bug or something else.   It seems like everyone is trying to create a Xbone/PS4 clone which includes a Blu-ray drive. Sure, add a cheap HDMI cable ($3) and a controller ($40 on sale). You could go with Linux instead of Windows and then the OS is free!   Also, if you wanna get REALLY nit picky, Xbone actually runs 3 different OS's concurrently and there's no way I'm paying for 3 copies! ;)   It's all good :) Type on Brother!   You could start a full size mechanical keyboard poll... That's the beauty of Massdrop :)  EDIT: Here you go :) https://www.massdrop.com/vote/full-size-with-10-key-numpad-mechanical-keyboard   I completely agree with you?! I was referring to /u/GoPlayTagPro who was inferring that the keyboards weren't that expensive at $125.  I have a Ducky Shine and I used to have a Model M I picked up at an estate sale. There's no way in hell I'd pay for a Datamancer as you're primarily paying for aesthetics, not performance. Also, LONG LIVE THE TENKEYS!    I don't know if you actually looked through the site, but a majority of the keyboards are between [$1000-$2000](http://www.datamancer.com/cart/the-seafarer-keyboard-p-220.html). The link for $125 was for the keycaps only.   The dickbutt on your drill press is a nice addition :)   Super late to the party, but some of the pros and cons you listed aren't exactly accurate.  **Frequency Response:** Yes, the v2 has a much wider range as far as frequency response goes. That said, a human with almost perfect hearing can only hear ~20Hz-20kHz, so the added range on the v2 is kinda useless. Most people can't even distinguish over 12-15kHz.   **Cable Length**: You listed shorter cable length as a bad thing, but for many people, having an unnecessarily long cable can be annoying. You can always [extend a shorter cable](http://www.amazon.com/Tripp-Lite-Microphones-Headphones-P311-006/dp/B0091F8G38/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8 qid=1426514185 sr=8-4 keywords=3.5mm+extension+cable), but coiling/wrapping a longer cable can be frustrating and even bad for the cable.  **Mic Freq. Response:** If you consider that a humans talking voice covers a range of about 85Hz-300Hz (a high pitched female scream can reach ~3000Hz), the difference between a mic that goes from 10,000Hz to 16,000Hz is useless in a headset. Since the v2 goes down to 50Hz (vs the v3's 100Hz) that is a tangible difference, although only for men with lower voices.  **Mic Sensitivity:** The v2 has higher sensitivity and will provide more gain, although a 4dB difference isn't huge.  **Headphone Impedance:** Without opening a huge can of worms, there is no ideal impedance for headphones. The relationship that impedance has on sound quality is much more complex, and from a PC gaming standpoint, has more to do with what's driving the headphones (motherboard, sound card, amp, DAC, etc). Also, a 3 Ohm difference is fairly negligible and both headsets can easily be driven my any PC without the need for further amplification.     Of course!  The 2015 Edition is essentially the pinnacle of a DIY NAS. The CPU, motherboard, RAM, hard drives, and even the case were all designed specifically for small format server use. This option will give you amazing performance and expandability down the road. The 2014 version is also excellent and for all intents and purposes you probably wont notice a huge difference between the two. Unfortunately, its not as expandable (mostly RAM and hard drives) although you may not want to expand past its already hefty limits. Another huge factor is price... 2015 was $1650 and 2014 was about $1000.  For what you're trying to do with it (media and file server) either are a fantastic option.   Acquiring a hard drive...?   Try Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, Kmart, or literally any other place that would sell a computer. Or the internet.  That said, you'd probably be buying a 3TB drive at best and those on sale are about $100.

 Went to a wedding of an extremely religious couple. About halfway through the ceremony, the bride starts washing her husband's feet like Jesus did for the disciples. I have no idea what it had to do with getting married, but it was very uncomfortable watching a woman bent down scrubbing her almost-husband's feet in front of a silent crowd.   I'm bi. I'm haven't really come out to anyone, but kind of my mom. My father is extremely homophobic and I'm guessing he isn't okay with bisexuality either.   I'm not planning on coming out to anyone I know unless I get a girlfriend who I'm serious about. I don't know how my friends would react and pretty much my entire family is very conservative. However, when I make new friends I'm pretty open about my sexuality.    Minnesota: Has beautiful lakes and a great place to raise a family (very safe, good schools).  Minnesota: Terribly cold, long winters. And it's boring.    Beautiful pictures! It's sometimes easy to forget how amazing some areas in the US are.  	4
 Dan "Hold her tighter, she's a fighter" Schneider   I'm not sure who he is, but I'm fairly certain I know how he died. I believe the woman who came forward in 2002 was telling the truth. That her mother bought the boy, and he was kept in the house, sexually and physically abused. She claims she was with her mother when the body was dumped, and details from her story match other confidential testimony. The reason no one puts much stock into her confession is because she's mentally ill. That just strengthens it in my mind though. If she was in a bad situation at home where horrors like that we're occurring, it would have undoubtedly messed with her mind. Coupling that with the time period, psychiatry being looked down on in general, and women being expected to be perfect, prim, and proper. Her mental illness became exponentially worse, making people think she's just another lunatic.   The boy in the box.   He's gotten so fat he's collapsing into himself, like a neutron star!   1.

Thank you :)   Age - 24  Sex - M  Race - Caucasian  This concerns the right side of my jaw. For years its made a clicking sound when I eat certain things, like tootsie rolls and stuff like that. When I was younger I could kind of move my lower jaw to the right and I could make the sound at will. I haven't done that in years but I've noticed from time to time it feels like the right side of my jaw is going to lock up. It's uncomfortable and lately it has been feeling more uncomfortable, to the point I'm careful when I eat because it feels like going to fast or anything might cause it to lock up.   *"Be gentle, theirs not mushroom."*   I throw my hand's up in the air sometimes.

 What's a matre'd by the way?    Chef here, I've spent entire nights dreaming about being in the kitchen after coming home from a particularly long/busy service. Also... dreamed a lot about Call of Duty in a period where I played quite obsessively.    I think I can spot Leo DiCaprio in there    I can't even... Just can't...    Unfuckingfortunately yes, it is   Edit : Downvote me all you want, I just don't see him in the role of Deadshot. His persona is just too well established and to me it's not a good fit for a movie like this.    Relevant username   	6
 Sounds awesome! Can you post that in the doc? I would, but I'm not sure of where you want the line breaks and that can obviously be a pretty important factor in poetry.

It's a good idea for sure. Just throwing my 2 cents in. Also fuck GroupMe.   I like the gift card thing. But I guess I just don't get the point of DaddyLeagues when all of those things can be done on the EA Madden page (as far as I know) and we can just twitch everything.   As someone with a pretty huge fear of death, I was mesmerized by this book. I was obviously horrified sometimes, what with the really stark and detailed description of the dying process. With that said, I absolutely agree that it is a must read book. Tolstoy's writing is obviously incredible, but the character does not at all reflect any sort of "carpe diem" mentality (at least from what I remember), which makes the book's themes even more appropriate.  Thanks for bringing this up because it often gets overlooked, understandably, amongst Tolstoy's other work. Also, it's a short novella, which makes it a pretty good starting point for Tolstoy's style if you're intimidated by the length of his other works.   Not the greatest movie, but the trailer for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was cut beautifully. Also, using Saint-Saens "Carnival of the Animals" was perfect. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAYtpZgelAM  	7
 I'm excited for you! :)    If you've seen all the Jurassic Park movies, how would you rate it out of all the movies?    Did you notice much product placement?    How was the third act, is it as good as people are saying? You don't have to spoil anything about it.    It got a little too real for me at the end when they started talking about all these real world problems. It took me out of the movie and made me think about how shitty the world can be.   It also didn't take place in Tomorrowland. We saw Tomorrowland for maybe 5 minutes and the rest the film was elsewhere. I was kindof looking for an escape and that certainly wasn't it.    I'm looking forward to reading some reviews tomorrow about it. I keep watching the trailers and TV spots. I'm just looking forward to the movie and seeing whether it's good or mediocre, I don't see it as being a horrible flop. What are people thinking about it now since it's only a couple days away? For those opposing it, if the reviews are good, would that change your mind about seeing it? For those excited about it, are you seeing it Thursday or over the weekend?    Titanic The Village Storm of the Century   James Cameron   Just wondering.    Okay but can we agree the visuals are extraordinary?    I know it's clich, and I know the story isn't very strong. But the visuals and story still hold up. I'm wondering is the movie as bad as everyone says it is?    Anyone know of a website that tells when trailers are going to be released?    Kate Winslet   Reign of Fire (2002), Below (2002), Knowing (2009), Identity (2003), Don't Say A Word (2001)    New Line Cinema and WB   Fox and the Hound    Titanic    Of Monsters and Men   The Killers   What movie do you absolutely love seeing places. For me it's Lord of the Rings.    I want something with tons of good special effects and aliens. Help me out.    Titanic and Lord of the Rings      Is there a website that allows you to stream torrents through your browser?    I'm so excited!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready.   Titanic is my favorite movie.   	27
 Great question! i have a few theories  I think a big factor is that homeless people sort of ask for money. This makes us feel uncomfortable as we get more or less forced into the idea of giving the money. When a homeless person asks you for money. On the other hand when we donate money to a celeb we feel less forced in to it. You created that idea yourself and that makes for a stronger desicion to actually go trough with the action.  A Second possible explanation could be that when you see your favourite celebrity you feel happy and you are inclined to show that you like them and donate to their lives. A homeless person doesn't look happy and doesn't give us the same happiness. We are more generous when we are happy (or less when we are not) thus you are less inclined to give away your money.   Last but not least, a celebrity we tend to donate to most of the time creates a "free" product / enternainment. So when we donate to them we tend to feel like we get worth for our money. When giving money to a homeless person we can only guess what happens with the money. And because of our prejudices about homeless people our guesses aren't that positive, hence we again feel less inclined to support to that cause.  **TL;DR its all about how it makes us feel**   I'm not trying to be rude but that's some pretty shitty expression of love.   If that had a build in speaker with the soundtrack playing i would be swinging that allll day.   From the Awolnation song Kill your heroes: "never let your fear decide your faith"  New stuff can be pretty scary but take the jump. Look at the positive side of things and don't get scared of by the negative/unknown.       TL;DR: Don't Panic   Finally found the source of [this gif](http://i.minus.com/ibuyoHSHzzGC3G.gif)   "Fear cuts deeper than swords"   Prince at Sziget 2011 (or 2012 im not sure). Im not a prince fan, but that show was so amazingly thight, professionally played. But the best point was it didn't feel like that because of the really fun, natural interaction he had with the crowd. Allround amazing performance.  Second best was The Naked And Famous this year. Sounds even better live than their records.   The speed trap is actually on the top of radillion. So that explains why RIC has the top speed (OP Redbull earo) and the top speed is "only" 309km/h. At the end of kemmel straight they go around 335 km/h   Meedoen is belangrijker dan winnen!   Targeting about 1h 45m. I'm used to that pace (about 5min/km) on 10+km runs now but i haven't had a practice run on full distance yet. We will see! But just completing the run will be satisfactory for me :)   Hey im running the 1/2 marathon too this year, first ever race. What is your target time?   Post it to /r/photoshopbattles they know what to do   [The Williams fw19](http://stolentshirts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/f1-1997-sanmarino-villeneuve-williams-fw19-renault.jpg).

 Maybe not the best, but my favorite. Frostfire - SOCOM 2    NSFW - fap material  It is called NSFW for that specific reason. Perhaps you should create a new tag called SFF (Safe for Fapping)    This might be off topic, but sometimes it is what someone doesn't say that hurts the most. For example, when someone that you care about a lot (and has told you that the feelings are mutual) hurts you in a way that you would not expect from them, a lot of times a simple recognition of the fact that they fucked up would be enough for closure. The lack of this can lead you to question everything leading up to this point, and whether they ever cared about to at all (or enough to avoid hurting your feelings).   I am on reddit at work for the same reason that you are on reddit at school/home/etc: if I have time to browse the internet, I am going to go to whatever sites I want to, provided they are appropriate (hence NSFW tags).    Some people need to realize that NSFW doesn't mean things that can't be shown on cable TV. Many companies do not mind if there employees browse the web from time to time, but they do not want them looking at camel toe and side boob.    Half-Life 3 confirmed   I had a lady come in today complaining that she was unable to print to the network printer down the hall from her office, so I went down to her office to see what the problem was. When I asked her to try again with myself present, she began spamming the "Paste" button over and over again saying, "See? Nothings happening!". Once I moved her mouse over to File - Print (effectively showing her how to print) she then proceeded to print out the same one page 40 times due to the fact that the kept hitting the paste button instead of print.    Too bad you're not Catholic   The entire game is set in a post-apocalyptic world that has been taken over by machines. Also, the ending.    Enslaved: Odyssey to the West. More people need to play this game.    Thank you for reminding me of how awesome this game was. Easily the best RPG of the DC/PS2/GC era.    Do you mean Dredd? Props if you do; that movie is fucking awesome.    1.) Aside from your more well known movies, what is one film that you thought should have gotten more attention, or didn't do as well in the box office as it should have?  2.) Tupac or Biggie?   Shipping is ridiculous. Shirt.woot.com is having the same deal with free shipping.    My friend was driving coming home from wedding reception. Lost control of truck around bend, clipped a telephone pole (went right through the side of it) and smacked into a tree doing roughly 50-60 MPH. I did not have a seatbelt on and all I can remember thinking was, "Please don't die."   Ended up smashing my face off of the windshield and messing up my arm but overall made it through relatively unharmed. Helped put a lot of things in perspective.    I can't be the only person that thought you were a dude in the first picture.   saving   I know I was supposed to be enjoying the pictures, but I couldn't take my eyes off of that soul patch.   I have ran quite a few times, mostly for harmless stuff, but the best was when hid under a fake Christmas tree in my friends basement.    Black Ops. Even though I still play MW3 to this day, I can't get past the shitty matchmaking and continual lag comp issues. If this isn't fixed for BO2, I will probably wright off the CoD franchise.       Only if it's Rockband.   Klein is small if I am not mistaken   I think it boils down to the fact that whether or not it disappoints you, **there is** a lack of endgame content to keep some people playing. Now for some people, this is not a problem as they will make new characters and enjoy exploring the world. For others, who like to continue to progress their character after they hit the level cap (whether through new rewards or just more content) GW2 will likely grow stale for them shortly after reaching max level.   Speaking for myself, I will most likely play a little PvP and WvW until I get bored and then stop. While GW2 doesn't have mechanics in the game that keep myself and many others coming back for more, I still had a lot of fun playing the game and think it was worth the $60 I spent.   If I could pick one thing that ANet should do in order to retain players, I think it would be to release new content or update zones based on player level ranges in an attempt to keep things fresh for people who have finished the game. Maybe have a few NPCs that will dole out weekly quests that are basically events that continue to fill out the world, while not necessarily putting a carrot on a stick. I don't think it would be that much to ask to reskin a few baddies, and put together 3-quest dynamic event or something.    All I can say is...wow. That is basically impossible to get, unless you spend a shit ton of money on gems and gold.    Strike that last comment then.    Lag compensation. After putting a lot of my time into MW and MW2, MW3 was unplayable for the first 6 months I owned the game. I just recently started playing again.    But relationships like that do exist in nature. The pilot fish and shark is one example, and the Goby fish and shrimp is another. Also, I think you underestimate the relationship between humans and animals, considering in most cases we do feed them and provide shelter.     I understand what you are trying to say, but there are already quite a few examples of animals in the wild that rely on other species for survival. What makes dogs evolution any different than that?   Just send invite if you want to play.   Anyone willing to hop on and play some CoD with someone who doesn't have any map packs? Used to play all the time during MW/MW2 but haven't gotten the itch until recently.   GT: CenTz01   Normally I would say to boost score since it's Kill Confirmed, but it looks like he doesn't have any points either.    [Spoiler](#s "Especially that episode about the Doctor's Daugher....wait. ")   I can't help but think the reason there is a crate at Tali's feet is because the artist could not draw her lower legs properly.    Edit: I understand this isn't the reason. Just saying.    You get what you pay for.   Nah. I don't think enough people will notice to care. To me, they look pretty stylish for being video game themed.    I may be a cheap-ass but am I the only one who thinks $18 + SH is a tad too much for a coffee mug? Don't get me wrong because I would use the shit out of this if I had one, but that's just too damn much.    This is the first time I have thought of it like this. If it plays out either way you described, I'll be one very happy reader.    You just put my thoughts into a coherent statement. Actually, after watching this movie, it made me appreciate Batman Begins and The Dark Knight more.    A few things that I will admit to doing:  * Putting innards of broken 360 into new 360 and returning to *******. * Amazon Prime Student for free. Graduated from college 3 years ago.    Let Me In was actually a pretty damn good movie.    I watched Grey's Anatomy. More than once.    1900 x 1200? Please? Pretty please?   Have they fixed the netcode yet? Just curious.    Just figured I'd put this up here as most of the members of this sub-reddit are fans of Sean Bean. Was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this movie.   	45
 Well my husband never buys me flowers, so it was about time someone did!   I didn't know I had any of them! It is a new house and I hadn't done much gardening. Then, just today I found all those and was so happy       I popped some of mine in a [pot](http://imgur.com/SHsHUTn) with a hyacinth and now they are filling my kitchen with fragrance. Love it!!!   I moved here 9 months ago and I am still in that phase.   Just this afternoon I had a minor joyous meltdown in my front garden because some random plants I had turned out to be daffodils...my favourite flower. Daffodils don't grow in QLD.  I love it here and I am glad you do too         In my experience, 3year olds are worse than 2year olds. Sure it might be the terrible twos, but have you ever had to deal with a threenager? A 3yo with the attitude of a 15yo! My niece has 5 older siblings and she is the worst of them all. So.much sass!   I just can't wrap my head around that many people being in one place at one time. I guess that is why it distracts itself with questions like, what if you needed to pee? Or, how would everyone get home after?   I am really open to donating my eggs as I see it that even though the child will have my DNA, I won't be it's mum. Good on you for giving that joy to someone else! What was the process like?   I get that this is hardly a flattering shot of her and it is a little scandalous because she spent her teenage years directly appealing to children...but honestly, how is this any worse than some of the stuff Madonna or even Cher has done?  Does no one remember [this](https://mumdujour.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/cherkini.jpg)?   It's easy with Regular show. All you have to do is replace their sodas with beers   The Erotic Adventures of Bendydick Cumbersnatch   Oh god...now I am imagining twigs and rocks getting all up in your cumbersnatch *shudder*   Z looks like he just dissed someone hard   I am going to go against the tide here and agree with you. I like a lot of people I have chatted to on here. Sure you get the occasional douchenozzle but I still have a positive experience   Eww cheap rip offs.   Yeah, any US stuff over here would be at least 3-4 bucks a bar   If you actually challenged a 7 yo with the topic of inequality you would be surprised with what they think.   My niece asked my sister a little while ago "why those two men were kissing". My sister told her because they loved eachother. She was ok with that.  Fast forward a few weeks when the SCOTUS ruling came out and she asked me what all the rainbows were in my Facebook. I explained that some people don't like it when two men or two women kiss and want to stop them getting married. The rainbows are put there to show that we don't want to stop them getting married.  She asked me, without prompting, why they can't get married and I told her that because people don't agree with it and don't think they should.  "But they aren't doing anything wrong! They love eachother and people in love get married!"  Even 7 year olds can understand the basics of equality. Give them a little credit.   Ugh. ~~One~~ Once you get your momentum up the water starts rocking with you. More and more and more until it is spilling out over the edge.    Shit, this kind of stuff just kills me. I need to know that this dog is hugged and kissed every day of his new life   You don't get Cherry Ripes or Milo over there?!  I'm so sorry.   Ha ha ok! I am going to feel like such a drug traffiker! Make sure you get a trenchcoat so we can make the exchange look as dodgy as fuck.  Edit: Wait...will your customs let me through? I don't want to end up on airport security   Caramel is great. Put them in the fridge for a while and the gooey caramel bit in the centre goes chewy and it is awesome.  The black forest and dark chocolate ones are also very good because dark chocolate just works with the biscuit.  The white I am not fond of.  But overall, I just can't go past original. Bite both ends a little to expose the biscuit then shove one end in a hot chocolate and suck on it like a straw. Heaven!   Cool, thanks!   My husband is a big beer man. And he loves US beer.   I have been introduced to most of the American sodas through my old work, actually. My favs are cherry doctor pepper and cherry coke. Anything cherry, really!  We will be in LA, Vegas, NYC, Boston and DC   DC   Ohh they sound good!   I wish, but no time :(   If you ever get the chance, do NOT use more than a light smear on heavily buttered white toast. It is an acquired taste and anyone who just dives right in and lays it on thick instantly regrets it.   Glee!   At first I thought the girl didn't know how to dance and was just being included so she could learn.  But those hips don't lie, girl got skills!   I know :(  Next time   Baker Street   Weeee! Can't wait :D   You like it?   Chowder is the top of my list for Boston!   LA, Vegas, NYC, Boston, DC   Which flavour?  Caramel, white, dark, double dipped, black forest, red velvet, peanut butter or normal?   You have no idea how many times I double-checked my name before using it. I wouldn't be caught dead with such a grammatical error unless I was trying to be ironic   We fly out the day before unfortunately :(  Halloween is a cheap gimmicky thing here. Shitty costumes and an excuse to get drunk.  Some kids come knocking but.most people wont have anything to give them   Chicago is not in the itinerary unfortunately   Flights are all booked unfortunately. Well, we had planned to train it but figured flying was easier. Ahh well...we shall see.  And Vegas was always on the cards. I really want to get all up in it's cheesy trashiness. There is nothing like it in Aus   Aww :(   I solomly swear I will go to Quincey Market!   Great! Thanks!   Cool, well thanks for that info. I will be sure to eat vegetables when I can. Much like I do now, I guess   It hasn't been mentioned yet. I do feel like my life is missing some chicken and waffles right now   Yeah I know. We want to do so much but travel time is such a bitch. We will come back in a few years but now it is the super sampler of the US.   What is domestic plane travel like? In Australia we can turn up an hour beforehand and it'll be sweet. Do I need to allocate more time?   It is a once in a lifetime trip for us and my husband would be devastated if Brady retired and he never got to see him play   What about chowder? I love chowder.  We will be in town for only a few days, mostly just my husband can see the Pats play on the 25th (he is a massive fan)   Yumm   Oh yes. All flights are booked, not trying to road trip it!   OoooOoh yes! My husband is a massive carnivore so we will definitely be hitting up BBQ joints   Wow awesome! Great info!  Australia actually has a fair few Max Brenner's now, so I can maybe give that one a miss. I prefer San Churro anyway    It'll just be myself and my husband and while we aren't rolling in cash we have some good $$$ to spend and would prefer a good hotel. We are mid 20's and like normal stuff, but mostly interested in the major sights and tastes due to only being in NYC for 5 days   No idea yet. Still haven't booked hotels   Sorry, DC   LA, Vagas, NYC, Boston and Washington DC. Mostly tourist trap type places.   LA, Vagas, NYC, Boston and Washington DC. Mostly tourist trap type places.   LA, Vagas, NYC, Boston and Washington. Mostly tourist trap type places. I woulf love to see the South but time is a restriction   I LOVE Mexican food. I will be trying as many different places as possible.   I am there for 3 weeks...I will likely eat actual food at some point   Oh, really? I do love mint slices, so I will still try some but I was hoping for something *more* amazing than them   Awesome! What else should I try while I am over there? I am pretty familiar with American candy (I used to work in a lolly shop that had an American section) but there are probably lots of other things I would like.  I know I want to try all the sugary cereals like Cap'n Crunch and Cinnamon Toast.  Edit: Holy cow I have a lot of food I need to try. You guys are gonna make me fat!  Edit edit: All of you are so nice. I am so excited to visit!   As an Australian planning to visit the US in October for 3 weeks, how might I obtain a box of these mythical Girl Scout Mints? They recieve so much hype that I figure I need to try them      Oh it's you again!   You know!   (Vet) Science!   3=====D  Got ya covered!      I just booked my holiday to go there and other parts of the USA in October!  I am from Australia, so I am super excited to see this crazy, fun country you people keeps going on about!   While it might have some truth to it for other people, this thing was definitely wrong for me.  It just told me I couldn't buy a house in Maroondah when I just did   This falls flat when they start rattling off names and you suddenly realise you can't remember any of their names   Sauce: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-30/adelaide-zoo-transfer-orphaned-joey-surrogate-wallaby-mother/6583042   Sauce: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-30/adelaide-zoo-transfer-orphaned-joey-surrogate-wallaby-mother/6583042         They are pretty cool. I wish suits of armour were still relevant and not restricted to medieval-fair going geeks who say m'lady in everyday sentences   These are just a sample of some of the amazing pieces from the Museum of Wearable Art in New Zealand that I happened to see when it visited Townsville, QLD on it's tour. A really wonderful display to see , with so much creativity!   The colourful piece with the horned helmet came first place in a competition they held.      Expressing sympathy. It's not like I don't *care*, I just hate all the empty words that peope say to try and make the pain easier.  I would prefer to just hug the person and leave it at that   As an Australian I could only *dream* of having a leader like Obama. Swapsies?   I'll just save all my links in a convenient place then!   For sure! Everyone knows what a rainbow stands for these days, especially Christians. But show them an athiest symbol and most won't recognise it.    But I suppose the argument Christian folk have against the LGBT and their rainbow isn't a new one, but it has been picked up again with all this new talk    A few posts on Facebook have popped up of Christian folk condemning the use of rainbows in the LGBT movement.   I couldn't help but laugh and comment with a variety of links pointing out the many times Christianity has commendeered Pagan and other symbols for their own use.  Needless to say my comments were deleted fairly quickly.   And you have such impeccable social skills that will surely help you through yours.   Cheer up   Righto. Thanks. Linking it up would be amazing. It would solve a lot of traffic woes IMO   Oh, I didn't realise it was unfinished. Where was it supposed to end?   Ha ha aww. Well, you tried :)   I don't get it   Those streets seem woefully unsuited to such high traffic. I would hate to live anywhere near them. A tunnel really seems like the only option though, unless they wanted to put thousands of people out of their homes   Brisbane has a Dakabin. It is about as classy as it sounds   I'm relatively new to the city and don't know much about the EWL, but would I have been able to use it if I were trying to get from Ringwood to the Hume highway? It seems like there should be a better way than through the suburban streets of Heidelburg and onto the Greensborough      |:( This is uncomfortable  :/ Ok this is better, I guess  Lick   Sometimes I wonder and dwell on the fragility of life, how the smallest thing can kill a man...and then I see stuff like this and can't help but marvel at the strength and endurance of humanity. These people are almost literally skeletons with skin...and yet hey *survive*. It is amazing.   My dog used to do this all the time. He loved it!   Redditors are a sour bunch. Quick to assume the worst.   I agree with you. They look like they are having a great time   See that's the secret....no lives actually matter   So many apostrophes   Ugh no it's not. But you are welcome to it   The humidity...oh god the humidity.  You could be naked, lying in your house under a fan and still be baking in your own skin. The humidity is like a steam room. It is everywhere and no matter what you do, it makes you hot and sticky.    Melbourne's daylight savings more than makes up for that hour lost. I love it!   We will be in NYC for 5 days beforehand   Have you spent any long periods of time in QLD? The hot is nice...for a while. Then it becomes insufferable. When it is literally too hot to go to the beach it is horrible.   You get that in QLD too though   Honestly, coming from QLD, the weather ain't so bad.  Sure, winter is cold and a little wet but summer is gorgeous! Mild, dry days and warm nights with sunlight stretching to 9pm.  QLD winters are chilly, like a Melbourne Spring but Summers SUCK! Hot, sticky days where the only relief is a summer storm that has a large chance of just fucking your shit up! And when it rains down here, it rains a little then it gets bored and leaves. In  QLD it rains for *days* and *days* you can't escape the hot dampness of it and just when you think it can't rain any more...it rains some more and then floods fuck your shit up!  10/10 would move to Melbourne again   Being from Queensland, I cannot refute this   [Hell yeah](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110807170741/disney/images/f/fa/Roxanne_in_Max's_dream.png)   This is not a dating site.   I always pictured Ginny that the redhead girl from A Goofy Movie   Awesome info. Thanks!   Also, hi!   Yeah you are probably right   No, it really doesn't. I can drive 15 hours at home!   Hmm...unfortunately I think we have come to the conclusion that the Falls may have to be missed. Flying up there just wouldn't fit into our schedule. Also, you might not have meant to, but I am starting to think that missing them wont be the end of the world. There seems to be an awful lot more I can enjoy in Boston   I would like to tailgate, but I don't think people would appreciate two random foreigners coming up and eating their food and drinking their booze :/   Cool, that looks great!  But I love mooses...meece?...moose. I hear they are super cuddly and love being apprached ;D   Well, I am a bit of a geek, so I like history, architecture and museums but we are going to Washington and the Smithsonian after Boston, so I don't want to wear myself out on too many museums.  My husband is a little more energetic. He likes sports, fishing and cars. We both like technology and the beauty of nature, and we both really like food.  That help you narrow it down? :P   This is not a place for advertising.    Ha ha well okay then! Thanks :D  And footy = Australian Rules Football   The worst race of all!   Something like this happened to me, cept I was the crazy animal lady.  Hear me out!  A few years ago, I got a new puppy. A tiny little foxihuahua no bigger than a coke can. After having him for only 1 day I quickly found that my yard had a big design flaw that he exploited easily, and escaped from. So, I had to go to the shops to buy a some items to fix it...but I couldn't leave him home alone or he would just escape. So my only obvious choice was to take him along.   After walking around the centre for a little bit, I quickly realised that every man, woman and child was going to stop me every 10metres to squee at my puppy, so I safely showed him in my big tote bag, bundled up in my jumper, where he promptly fell asleep.   Jump ahead to me exiting a store without making a purchase and the attendant stopping me to check my bag (regular thing, he wasn't suspicious). I didn't really know what to say so I just nodded and opened the bag revealing my tiny, sleeping puppy.  The man paused, took a moment to comprehend what he was seeing, and then asked if that was a puppy in my bag. I said yes, he let out a little squee and then let me leave.  Moral of the story is, if you want to commit petty theft, bring a puppy along. It will distract security from the stolen items hiding in your pockets.     So was Voldy....  Coincidence?   Seems to me the whole thing  ould be planned a bit better :/  I went to the footy in my city the other day and on top it costing me $30, the stadium is right next to a major train hub, so if you missed your train it wasn't a problem...there would be another in 10mins   Like what? Share your local knowledge with me!!   Oh dang. Thanks for the info!!!   I am wary of renting a car, but if we caught the train and headed in hours earlier, would that be safe?   Cool. Time is not too much of a problem if it does change. We have nothing else on that day, except the game. We thoughy we might head in early, no matter the time and soak in the atmosphere   My ex-Army husband would like that very much!   Thanks! It looks like I have definitely underestimated the distance   We will be in NYC for 5 days before Boston, but I was figuring that Niagara Falls was more accessible from Boston. Oh well, I guess I can live without seeing them :(  Also, money isn't really the limiting factors for us for Pats tix. I am expecting $500+ and for a one-off event, I am OK with that   First, Pats tickets. My husband is a MASSIVE Pats fan and he is desperate to go to the Pats vs Jets game on the 25th. Are we dreaming, or can we easily get some tix?  Second, if we had a spare day-and-a-half, are we mad to try and duck out to Niagara and see the Falls? They are on my list but we only have a small window. I know the drive is a long one but what about a train?  Thanks :)   (   )   Cool  	137
 ** 6 people. There was the first person who is unrelated to the whole DEA kerfuffle. Then there were the two people you're talking about. The second one was living with three other SR dealers and DPR OK'd a hit on them because it made it easier to get the one guy.   They weren't dropped. There's a pending trial in maryland regarding the murder charges. The sentencing does have something to do with that as the attempted murder charges are what the law likes to call sentencing aggravators.   not instant   .   Damn you're really desperate to believe that this guy is innocent. Nobody persuaded DPR to use a hitman. Nobody even suggested it or alluded to it until he did, ergo nobody entrapped him into committing conspiracy to commit attempted murder in the first-degree. Furthermore, they were blackmailing him by threatening to reveal the identities of SR users which is not illegal, especially because SR at its core is an illegal operation. None of the circumstances would be considered an attempt at entrapment. On top of that none of these guys have been confirmed to be DEA agents, the whole theory that they are DEA agents was created by DPR's supporters. From a legal standpoint if the people he attempted to hit are in fact DEA agents it still wouldn't be considered entrapment because having them murdered was his idea and his idea only. At one point the person he was talking to in that chat log asked if there's another way to resolve the problem because murder draws too much attention and DPR maintained that murder was the only solution.   Uh huh? Here's the conclusion of that hit. He's asking for pictures at the end. Still sound like role playing?  **Dread Pirate Roberts 3/31/2013 17:00:** Thank you R W. Ive only ever commissioned the one other hit, so Im still learning this market. I have no problem putting my faith in you and I am sure you will do a good job. The exchange rate is above 90 right now, so at $90/btc, $150k is about 1670 btc. If the market tanks in the next few days, I will send more. Here are some random numbers for a picture: 83746102 Here is the transaction # for 1670 btc to 1MwvS1idEevZ5gd428TjL3hB2kHaBH9WTL4a0a5b6036c0da84c3eb9c2a884b6ad72416d1758470e19fb1d2fa2a145b5601 Good luck and be safe, DPR  **Redandwhite 3/31/2013 23:02:** I received the payment. I appreciate the offer if bitcoins lower in value. We know where he is. Hell be grabbed tonight. Ill update you.  **Redandwhite 4/1/2013 22:06:** Your problem has been taken care of. They seized a bunch of stuff he had with him at the time as well. They said he had a couple laptops and a bunch of usb sticks. Is there anything of that, that belongs to you? They questioned him and he spilled everything he knew. He said that he and Xin were actually working together on this scheme to blackmail you and that they were brought in by a 3rd guy who has been selling on here for a couple years who is a scam artist. Apparently he makes selling accounts, sells for a while and then pulls a big scam and he just keeps creating new accounts after he does his scams. They got that guys name also , I will give that to you free of charge when I meet them to get the picture and computer hardware they got. Rest easy though, because he wont be blackmailing anyone again. Ever.  **Dread Pirate Roberts 4/2/2013 00:55:** Excellent work. Please send any info you can get on this third party along with the picture. The picture can be uploaded here: ------I've removed the link for the sake of the reddit post but it's still in the transcript------ I have no need for any of his possessions, so you can do what you want with that stuff. Thank you again for your assistance, DPR    He was talking about using a hitman before anyone was threatening his safety. Have you read the [transcripts](http://www.wired.com/2015/02/read-transcript-silk-roads-boss-ordering-5-assassinations/)? He doesn't come across as someone that's being coerced, in fact he was the one that suggested using a hitman.  **Dread Pirate Roberts 3/27/2013 23:38:** In my eyes, FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldnt mind if he was executed, but then youd be out your $700k. I dont think he is going to come up with the money because he seems very desperate.  Then later when they're negotiating the price he mentions that he has already used a hitman before  **Dread Pirate Roberts 3/31/2013 8:59 :** Dont want to be a pain here, but the price seems high. Not long ago, I had a clean hit done for $80k. Are the prices you quoted the best you can do?  He's not someone that I feel particularly sorry for.   First degree murder carries a minimum of life in prison under federal jurisdiction. The people that are serving X years to life with the possibility of parole were convicted of second degree murder which is murder without premeditation. Six counts of attempted first degree murder is definitely enough to warrant life in prison.   Legally it should have bearing on his sentencing. It's called extenuating circumstances or aggravating factors depending on the jurisdiction.   Entrapment is different than what you appear to believe it to be. Entrapment requires the officer to persuade the suspect into doing something that they otherwise wouldn't do, IE if an undercover cop came up to you and asked you to sell them drugs and you said yes that's not entrapment, but if the continued pressing until you eventually agree then that is entrapment. Creating a problem and then stepping in when he decides that he needs a very violent solution is not entrapment.   I think it's the murder/attepmpted murder that really did him in but ok   I mean he went to CSU Northridge so it's sort of a moot point. There are two world class universities in his city and a whole bunch of slightly above average schools. Dude has a ton of competition that's probably more qualified.   Who is she?   It can burn some good spots if the police/anti longboard dbag/whatever in your area learns of them   You're supposed to do it with your wallet anyways because regularly sitting on it is bad for your spine.   .   It comes with 10" reverse kingpin 50 degree caliber 50s. how do those compare do you think?   Thoughts on the arbor mindstate? I've already got a shirt little commuter board so I really want something longer that's good for flat/small hill carving. Maybe eventually learning to carve.   https://mobile.twitter.com/JenSelter/status/568546878062768128/photo/1   Brah  https://mobile.twitter.com/JenSelter/status/568546878062768128/photo/1   According to urban dictionary it's an 18" long joint made with 12 rolling papers   That particular booty belongs to an instagram fitness model named Jen Selter who's basically squatting 24/7   That's not what's happening here. She didn't consent to the circumcision per say, the contract was a custody agreement with a stipulation that effectively gave the ex-husband sole guardianship when making this decision. She's not backing out of a circumcision contract, she's reneging on her custody agreement.   That's not what's happening here though. The contract didn't say "my son will undergo circumcision," the contract was a custody agreement with a stipulation that gave her ex-husband the power to decide whether or not to get the son circumcised.   She didn't sign a contract that forced the son to undergo circumcision, she signed a custody contract that gave her husband authority to decide whether or not to go through with circumcision.    In-n-out is great and 5 guys is good in a greasy kinda way. Burgerville is just... eh...    JP Morgan is admitting civil wrongdoing in the letter that OP linked. None of those acts are criminal.    good luck bro   Eh anyone that's ever watched baseball knows the risk of going to a game. Foul balls fly into the stands all the time. My guess is that a disclaimer is printed on the ticket.   The overwhelming odds were that they would get a nice pay check and go home with a cool story about being on TV. I doubt they had even really considered the possibility of actually being brothers.   I wish my roommate was as reasonable as you. His dota addiction had him going until 4 or 5 because he just gave up on school. He decided he needed a mechanical keyboard and he refused to leave the room when I was trying to sleep. Managed to get through the year without punching the shit out of him and now I never have to see his sorry ass again.   Luckily no marine mammals have been found to be oiled yet, and most of the oil did not make it into the ocean, but if anyone knows of a good charity that helps with oil spills to donate to let me know.   The kind of people that are executives of fortune 500 companies have an ungodly work ethic, are near geniuses, and can somehow work 15-20 hours a day 7 days a week without going insane or burning out. You can replace a cashier, a customer service rep, a salesman in an instant, you can replace an IT guy in a day, a middle manager in a week, a wall st broker in two weeks, but finding someone that has the education, intelligence, work ethic, experience, and mental fortitude that it takes to run a fortune 500 company is damn near impossible. It's easy to find someone with one of those traits, but probably one in a million people have all of them. The job market is all about supply and demand. The supply of unskilled laborers far outweighs the demand, the supply of college educated laborers slightly outweighs the demand. The demand for someone qualified to run a fortune 500 company far far far outweighs the supply so they are very expensive.   A lot of the CEOs that run fortune 500 companies didn't start the company so that's a bit of an odd way to look at it.      live with friends not randos and you'll be fine.    Stepping on someone's hand isn't assault.... Assault requires intent to commit battery, she did not commit assault, he did.   Yeah just the deck. The complete was 100 something    Have any of you heard of "ztuntz" skateboards? Apparently they make officially licensed uni skateboards and when I was in the bookstore today I saw one of their pintails and it has a pretty fire graphic. $62 for the deck - 44" 7 ply not sure what the wood was. I kinda want to get it and toss some carving trucks on but I dont want to spend that kind of money on a crap deck.    I mean Garoppolo is obviously no Brady but I don't think not having Brady will be absolutely devestating to their ability to effectively move the ball.   I don't remember that. Did it make the news or was it kept on the DL?   It is and there's like only one dude that posts there and mods it but he posts updates like it has a large subscription base   The audiophile did a blind test survey with multiple songs. Each song was divided into quarters, one playing lossless, one playing 192kbs,  one playing 320kbs, and the final quarter playing another quality. Iirc the results were pretty random and most of them couldn't discern the difference between 192, lossless, and 320   Sauce?      The dna mom wanted child support from the other lesbian after they split up but kansas is backwards and refuses to acknowledge homosexuality so the state is going after the father for child support    The average cost of raising a child from birth to 18 is $245k BEFORE college is factored in. Infants can easily cost $50 a week for diapers and formula alone. It's not that only the rich should procreate, but you should make sure you're financially secure before having a kid. Especially if it's through a method as calculated as artificial insemination.   He says to the 19 year old   Is there such thing as a "longboarders knee?" I've been experiencing a soreness on the inside of my knee on my pumping leg. I haven't taken a spill or anything but there's a visible bruise on the knee.   Everyone dreams you just don't remember them   That assumes that the city owns the signs      Sector 9 chamber or fractal, maestro mini, landyachtz 35 battle axe, arbor genesis 38?   5'9 and my pants length is usually 30   Hey what's a good carvy drop thru cruiser setup? I was originally thinking of getting a board from sector 9's sidewinder series but now I'm not so sure because I've heard the twin pins make them ride kind of high and I'd like a low board this time. Definitely want something shorter than 38" because I need to commute with it on campus. How's the Arbor Mindset? Bustin surf cruiser 36?    Shoulda bashed his nuts more    Unless you have a grade A Mike Tyson level knockout punch boxing has a lot more to do with strategy than brute force. It's all about landing jabs and getting points.   Jesus you weren't kidding that was brutal. The moment they had access to the back of their opponent's head they just started wailing on them.   Not really best of worthy   So I mentioned to my dad that I'm planning on selling my single speed road bike before I come home from college and he asked me not to because he wants to start cycling casually to go to work and get in better shape. The problem is the guy is getting up there and I think the geometry of my bike might be a bit too aggressive for his back. I was thinking I should get him a comfort style bike and I was originally looking at the Giant Cypress but it's just a bit too far out of my price range. If I need to I'll shell out the extra $50 but if there's anything I can get in the sub three hundred price range that's better I'd like to know.   Are any of these good?  http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/comfort_bikes.htm   Yeah but he's a fucking retard and a half......   COPY CAT! GUYS I FOUND A COPY CAT!    no they're not in the same situation. She's effectively OPs landlord and as OP stated, the rent he paid is reasonable for the area. It's capitalistic, not immoral.    The lawyer would destroy them and get the kid an obscene amount of settlement money   It is hilarious!   I could see that. You can do the most sadistic twisted shit to someone but as long as they come through it alive you're not going on death row. Level IV is probably where all the rapists and gangsters are.   did she teleport back to the 70s?   Bro anything can work to lose weight as long as you cut calories. I've lost 50lbs from a diet consisting mostly of burritos burgers and sandwiches. The key is to find the best way to spread the calories out over the course of the day that won't leave you snacking. For me I can't do the whole three 500 calorie meals thing because it leaves me feeling hungry when I try to sleep, so what I do is have maybe a snack around lunch and then I eat a 1000-1300 calorie dinner.   but is she hot op   When your back is against the wall you don't need a criminal lawyer, you need a *criminal* lawyer.   That is patently false. Attorney-client privilege does not protect prior knowledge of a crime and it certainly does not allow the attorney to assist their client by preparing an alibi      What footstops are you guys using? I find that my foot slowly slides forward when I transition from foot forward while pumping to foot sideways while riding.   I don't think that's how it works   I believe so   Why two BAs?   Open top vehicle, lax secret service security at the time, etc etc etc. There's nothing "ridiculous" about it. Anyone can fire three shots at a slow moving vehicle. It doesn't require special training.   I mean there have been 6 line of duty deaths caused by gunfire so far this year and 259 since 2010 so it does happen...  https://www.odmp.org/search?name= agency= state= from=2010 to=2015 cause=Gunfire filter=nok9  https://www.odmp.org/search?cause=Gunfire from=2015 to=2015   Eh dongs seem to be the one part of the human body that's not consistent. I've seen some pretty startling dongs in locker rooms. plus when people fart you might see a bit of cheek flappage and that's never good.   Yeah the whole stadium state championship thing makes more sense in the south.    Why does the FB team wholly own Autzen but the baseball team is sharing PK park with the ems?   I think the 2014 hs championship was held there   You ever been to Venice, CA? Culture won't be a problem.   It's not an NFL franchise. It's a new league. Basically minor league football.      You're making 3000 below federal minimum wage for a full time worker so you should take that up with your boss, but cost of living increases as wage increases because people that make more money tend to begin buying higher end foods, renting better apartments, getting better phone and internet plans etc. Even with all that it doesnt mean it's enough to never feel unhappy or inadequate again.   Money, battery life, data storage. Gopros are good at a lot of things but being an all day police body cam is not one of them.   How well does the silent alarm work for you?   I was going to get the fitbit flex but the jawbone up2 cane out the other day so now I'm trying ti decide between tge two. What do you guys have? How are you liking them?   How well does the silent alarm work?   The HR monitor on the UP3 lets it do more in depth sleep tracking.   Ah Vince; have you met my favorite realtors Vic Vinegar and Hugh Honey?   Are we soing D D references? Never played it.   JERKY!!! I know it has an obscene amount of sodium but a whole bag of jack links is like 180-210 calories depending on the flavor and it's super filling so that's my go to late night snack.   Eh I wouldn't call it lawful as they occasionally break their own laws. I'd say chaotic evil v predictable evil   I thought it was already supposed to do that      Cycling addy, ritalin, and modafinil may prevent the tolerance build up.   I don't think so. The three strike law is for habitual offenders so I'm pretty sure the felonies can't be from the same incident.   Can't even imagine how fucked up her and her brother's kids are.    Not rich people, obscenely rich people that wield more economic and trade power than many countries.   Eh I would start with cycling or distance walking. Running at your weight is going to give you some gnarly shin splints at the very least and that will only serve to give you an excuse to take 2 week breaks so they can recover. If you have a bike then just map out a path for you to take that has more uphill than downhil. Even cycling on a 1% incline is going to burn some calories. If you don't have a bike then just start walking, then speed walking, and eventually jogging.   four weeks? The app I downloaded is 8 or 9 weeks   But then it would just be a regular ninkasi brew      sweet thanks   How?   Same thing happened to me. Not liking lollipop at all.... Wish I could go back somehow.   I'm working a new fitness regimen that involves C25k. It's essentially just C25k with lifting on the rest days. With C25k did it ever feel like it was moving too fast for you? I've never been a very fast runner and I've never been good with distance running either, even when I was a kid, so I'm kinda wondering if I should improve my running a bit on my own before I attempt it because I don't want to get discouraged and give up.   Have you ever slept through it?   The silent alarm is one of the most appealing things about the fitbit for me. I always wake up feeling groggy if I'm using an alarm and I usually have to have 4 alarms at 15 minute intervals to actually wake me up. If this will actually wake me up feeling more refreshed then I'm buying one right now.   Graduated last year, can say with certainty that people don't go up there to make out, or atleast that it's not a "designated make out spot." They do go up there for instagram and prom pics though.   What really got me is that the orb things look really far away but there's no change in their appearance at all when they dip behind a cloud. Not even a little bit of light filtering.   Key word there is trade. It's probably not illegal to possess as long as there is no intent to sell.   Yall are some stingy motherfuckers    Who here has tried out the new fitness bands that jawbone released the other day? I've been eyeing the UP2 but there aren't enough reviews yet for me to decide    Nah there's a lot of new age "science" (same stuff that gave us gluten free people and antivaxxers) that says formula is better for the kid.   football is dank though   Maybe idk for sure though. If that's the case then you guys are getting shafted by your lawyers which really sucks because they're supposed to help you.   That's not how it works. The gross settlement was 3mil but the net settlement (settlement after expert witness fees, copy costs, other expenses) was probably closer to 1.5mil, maybe less. The lawyer fees are then 30-50% of the net settlement. The majority of the money goes to pay for the testimonies, private investigative work, and paperwork that actually won you the case. The lawyers are really taking no more than ~25% of the gross settlement.   It is not a doctorate in any sense of the word. It is not considered a doctorate by any governing body of academia. That is why it is called a Doctor of PT degree and not a **doctorate** of physical therapy.    They do but they recently raised the tax rate on dividends and short term capital gains from 15% to 20% so he's not actually saving himself that much, certainly not 930k in savings.   I mean maybe but you can't actually get capital gains until you sell an asset. Their wiki says that the company is wholly owned by the CEO and his brother so I doubt he'll be selling his share soon.   It's not a real doctorate. The "doctor of physical therapy" degree isn't an actual PhD or MD program. It's a 3-4 yr professional degree that requires no residency to complete. Here's the USC curriculum for DPT, as you can see it's honestly not that rigorous of a curriculum, just time consuming:  http://pt.usc.edu/Education/Programs/PhysicalTherapy/DPT/Curriculum/   Bro PT degrees are the quintessential former athlete degree. I've got tons of buddies that are or were doing PT. You can get by doing some fairly easy classes. Depending on the school the math requirement is almost nonexistent and you just need to reach 200 level biology courses. It's the anatomy classes that get you, but even then it's not too hard. Most schools don't have cadaver labs....   As far as I can tell this is a private company so he has no shareholders to impress. Cutting your salary by 930k, from 7 figures to 5 figures, so that you can pay your employees more is absolutely not capitalistic. If it's a publicity stint it's way overkill. There's no way this will lead to enough new customers that he can make up the 970k a year.   I mean that's solid advice but if this guy might not pull 30k with his major and he doesn't care about the subject then he should change it. If he loves the subject them good for him. I'm lucky because I'm interested in finance and macroeconomics and luckily both econ and finance tend to pay pretty well.   It's an interesting move for sure.... and it defies basically every concept of  capitalism. I'll be watching this one to see how it plays out.   Daaaaaamn op you rich    change majors homie. Even if you're not super smart, physical therapy/exercise physiology/kinesiology majors are basically guaranteed 60k+ if they go into physical therapy.   I sorted your comments by top. Literally took less than 30 seconds of my life away   nah it doesn't if some of my opinions line up with yours then were chilling   I had a suspicion so I did a cursory check of your post history. Found the rp posts in a minute.   She's on the wrong side of the spectrum for that to be true.   I don't consider myself a feminist. I don't go to feminist rallies. I don't read feminist literature. I consider myself someone that uses common sense to form opinions, and I tend to examine both sides before settling on a position. I have liberal opinions, I have conservative opinions. I support some parts of feminism, and I condemn some parts of feminism. By no means have I been brainwashed by feminists. I will say that the redpill does have some cult like tendencies and it is by no means a moderate position. You guys are to mens rights as the women that advocate chastidy belts and therapy for every man are to feminism.     Alright well lets pick apart this video.  1) Right off the bat the lady in the video starts describing why boys have trouble in school. She says that they are "Boys tend to be disorganized and restless, some have even been known to be noisy and hard to manage."   Now her description of what a "typical boy" is like is a bit weird, idk where you went to school but I had friends that were guys that were completely organized, and I had friends that were a bit messy. Same goes for girls, but the interesting part is the "some can even be noisy and hard to manage" bit. What she's describing there sounds like ADHD, not "typical boy" behaviour. Boys are [three times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD compared to girls](http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/childhood-adhd/features/adhd-symptoms-in-girls-and-boys).   2) Then she quotes a psychologist, Michael Thompson, he says "Girl behaviour is the gold standard in school, boys are treated like defective girls." Now I tried to google this Michael Thompson, after a bit of effort I found his website. He has a PhD in... something, I'm assuming psychology. The problem is that in the bio section of his website he makes no mention of where he got his undergrad, where he got his phd, etc. According to his website hes really more of an author because he has never been involved in clinical psychology, and he references no studies to back up his claim, effectively making it an unfounded opinion.  3) She then goes on to explain that boys score lower than girls on national reading exams. I have a serious problem with this claim because she provides no source to back it up and after 15 minutes of googling I can't find anything to support it.  4) She then goes on to cite isolated incidents regarding zero tolerance in schools ~ irrelevent.  5) Every following argument is rooted in broad generalizations about boys.  This video makes a lot of big claims without backing a single thing up with evidence.   My guess is that if I looked through your post history I would find posts in /r/mensrights and /r/theredpill. Those are both what psychologists like to call, [echo chambers](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_%28media%29), and they are very unhealthy things to spend extended periods of time in without examining opposing view points and comparing them to your own beliefs.  In the words of the philosopher and mathematician William K. Clifford:  If a man, holding a belief which he was taught in childhood or persuaded of afterwards, keeps down and pushes away any doubts which arise about it in his mind, purposely avoids the reading of books and the company of men that call into question or discuss it, and regards as impious those questions which cannot easily be asked without disturbing it -- the life of that man is one long sin against mankind   If you took even 5 minutes to Google Camille Paglia you would  see that she's incredibly controversial in the feminist world, and that most prominent feminists oppose her and view her as an extremist. You would also see that Paglia herself views mainstream feminism itself as a problem, labeling it stalinist and repressive to women   This is 100% certified bullshit. - Male college student.   What sort of clothing should I pack?   A SEAL team arrives late in the night at the camp where these scumbags live. They slowly make their way through the camp slitting the throats of the guards and the sleeping soldiers. As they grow closer to the scumbags they go loud so that the fear and the anxiety grows within them as the SEALs inch closer. Gunfire and shouting is all they hear as it dawns on them that some of the most elite fighters in the world are coming for them. The SEAL team finally reaches them and forces them to look at the bloodshed around them. The scumbags flinch everytime one of the SEALs moves their gun. But to the SEALs death is too humane of a way to go for these men, as is anything that the US government would permit them to do, and that's saying something. The SEALs decide to hand them off to one of our more... controversial allies. The Israelis. The Israelis in turn give them to Mossad telling them to do what they wish. After Mossad is done extracting information from them in the most inhumane and excruciating ways possible they decide it's time to kill them. No ordinary execution is enough though. Mossad decides to shackle each of their limbs to a 100lb cement block and leave them in the desert near the Israeli-Palestinian border, but before leaving them there they attach a large saline drip to each of them so that they'll survive the dehydration, at least for awhile. The men then spend their last days wondering what will finally kill them, the sun? a scorpion? A stray Hamas rocket? Starvation? Will they outlast the saline drip and spend their last hours in a state of dehydration induced delirium? Who knows, but it will be a slow death and that is fine by the rest of the world.

I was just pointing out that having eaten McDonald's doesn't narrow down the suspect pool that much.   The McDonald's argument wouldn't work because it's the most popular chain in the world and there were probably 100+ mcdonalds serving 100+ people a day in LA at the time.   He raped a 3 year old girl. That is the very definition of a violent crime. Moreover, most prison sentences are not served all the way through due to overcrowding.    These guys are basically celebrities in the finance world. It may not be right but it was inevitable.   This guy opted for a nonjury trial though so the judge is also the jury and theoretically he could be the executioner if they somehow turned this into a murder 1 case and he volumteered for executioner duty   That's not how it works. Juries have no say in the sentence. That's what the judge is for.   Nope. This is a case of Nepotism.  Her father is a judge in the county (parish because it's Louisiana) where this happened. Apparently every judge in the county had to recuse themselves from the case, meaning they all know her father, meaning the DA probably doesn't want to be on his bad side.   Yes, it makes sense to assume that the presumably intoxicated man that was trying to prevent the police from setting up a crime scene at a stabbing is lying.   Yeah source of money is a thing. The theory is that you're not as likely to skip bail if it's your money or a close friend/family member's money.   You can't privately fund a district attorney as that is bribery.

You sound upset, internet friend. Talk about it while I take you seriously.   The question isn't whether or not it's a penis issue. We KNOW it's a penis issue.

No, he's an extreme left that will leave the independent vote untouched. So far, I'm putting my money on O'Malley.            Not to give him too much credit here, but Marilyn Manson did this fifteen years ago.            Not a problem at all.

Never heard of anything like this, sounds interesting.      I tried Youtube and it didn't work. I spent hours doing a .5 second by .5 second frame analysis of the Star Wars E7 (That's Episode 7 for the neanderthals reading this) trailer specifically to prove to people that the red lightsaber handguard is an absolutely redundant and stupid creation, but I'm pretty sure I used language that is too intelligent because no one watched my video, which obviously means they can't keep up with me.

This is something I've been working on for a while and just decided to try and run a kickstarter on it. I think if you can show that level of interest and make it a personal story, that helps.   I really didn't know what to expect and honestly didn't expect to raise anything for what was a personal project for me. I've been studying Malcolm X for about ten years and wanted to put together a 1,500 page collection of speeches, debates and interviews. After about a week, it's been successfully funded! I've still got three weeks to go, so hopefully I'll raise some more. My only tip: Social media was actually quite helpful in spreading the word.  [Malcolm X: Collected Speeches, Debates and Interviews](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1252814726/malcolm-x-collected-speeches-debates-and-interview)               This show was phenomenal, Del was on point and the crowd was really into it. Superb.       Yes.    All this corruption and violence is directly or indirectly due to the insatiable U.S. demand for drugs, particularly cocaine, heroin and now methamphetamines.   End the drug war now.       My friends are making a documentary about this very issue:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZxvZxF-TiA     "You know, I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail. That's my business. That's what I do."   What a terrible, terrible movie. But not as bad as JFK. Oliver Stone is one of the worst directors America has ever produced.    Bingo.    Dave Chappelle looks smarter and smarter every year.   I haven't had cable for ten years and I think the only thing I've missed is a decade's worth of commercials. If something like Walking Dead or Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones is good enough, it hits your radar. Sucks not being able to watch live sports events, but there's ways around that as well.   Who the fuck still pays for cable?    Seconded.    A masterpiece. A disturbing, haunting and terrifying masterpiece.    Agreed, they compliment each other very well...and it would just be so great to see Otomo go back with a serious chunk of cash and make his manga into a trilogy!    That's mostly me.    Can't wait until TIME releases the [new version of its magazine for adults](http://www.theonion.com/video/time-announces-new-version-of-magazine-aimed-at-ad,17950/).    Two points:  Without fail, there's someone in every Akira thread who has to make the point that if you like the movie, you'll love the Manga. This time, I'm that guy. As much as I like the movie, the ending is fairly opaque and lots of the story is necessarily missing. Again, I like the movie, a lot, but the Manga, to me, is where Otomo really shines as a genius. That he wrote and drew it is a major, serious artistic achievement. It's a lot more mature because it's able to flesh out the characters and the plot. Just check out Volume 1, you won't regret it.  Second, here's [Godspeed You! Black Emperor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG5d_eeGQxE), a movie about Japanese bike gangs that documents a phenomenon that I'm sure was an influence on Akira.

The problem I have with the Bechdel Test is that it's simply a quantitative and not a qualitative judgment. Whether or not a film passes the test says nothing about the quality of a film, only whether or not it passes some arbitrary gender rule. Having established that passing or failing the test does not say anything about a film being good or bad makes the test completely and totally irrelevant in my book (see: Reservoir Dogs, Lawrence of Arabia, The Wild Bunch, My Dinner with Andre or 12 Angry Men.) What's next? Let's see if the film has two named black characters who talk to each other about something other than a white person. Let's see if the film has two named LGBT characters who talk to each other about something other than a straight character. Whatever. How about you make an engaging story in an interesting way. That's the only test I care about.   "I've got everything under control." - Rob Ford, April 2014   Yeah, looks great, where is Fallout 4?    I love Miike's work, he's one of the most original and hard-working directors of the last few decades. With a bit of googling, you can easily come up with a list of films to watch as his filmography can be pretty intimidating.

Congratulations.    A perfect example of what I'm talking about. I'm sure it's an interesting book, but there's not one single shred of hard evidence in your post. Everybody who has even a passing interest in JFK's assassination knows who Mohrenschildt was. Mailer's book spends chapters on him. But conspiracy theorists always assume everyone else is a moron. Let's put aside all of the evidence of Oswald's life, the witnesses who heard the shots coming from right above them in the book depository, Oswald's attempt on Edwin Walker, the murder of Tippit and all the other evidence and keep going down the rabbit hole...   http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/biographies/oswald/interview-gerald-posner/    I've said it before and I'll say it again: the problem with the JFK conspiracy theories is that in 50 years, there is not one single shred of hard evidence suggesting that there was any kind of conspiracy. On the other hand, there is a mountain of hard evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald did it. Every conspiracy theory is simply conjecture and hypothesis with no hard evidence whatsoever. It's fun to speculate, but that's all it will ever be, speculation. Evidence and reason and logic all point to Lee Harvey Oswald.    As if it ever went away.       Yeah, because we'll probably only hit the exact people we want to kill and certainly not kill any innocent people thus creating more people who hate us and want to kill us or anything like that.

Mystery of Chessboxing (international title Ninja Checkmate) is a kung fu film released in 1979 and directed by Joseph Koo, starring Mark Long, Jack Long and Lee Yi Min. This movie is the inspiration for the Wu-Tang Clan song "Da Mystery of Chessboxin'" on the album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). Wu-Tang Clan member Ghostface Killah also takes his name from the film's distinctive villain.      I agree and I don't think there's anything wrong with treating books and records as *objets d'art*. They can be beautiful creations that have merit as physical objects that digital files simply can never replicate.   Haven't you seen Pulp Fiction?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBP0Mbc7VFw    "My girlfriend's a vegetarian, which pretty much makes me a vegetarian."   The only crime is getting caught.    You are completely wrong about John Woo. I'm guessing...just guessing here...that you've never seen Hard Boiled or The Killer? His Hollywood movies are mediocre compared to those two. Hard Boiled is probably the best action movie ever made. Neither of them are brainless. Also, check out Red Cliff. Stunning.     Dude, I could not agree more. Eraserhead is unique and fascinating, especially for the time it came out. Blue Velvet is a brilliant anti-Reagan film (not literally, but it puts the lie to the whole small-town America myth). I actually really like Dune. I think it's one of the best sci-fi movies of the 80s. The special effects hold up 30 years later.  The rest of his oeuvre leaves me cold. Lost Highway was almost unwatchable. Mulholland Dr. was just meh. Same with Twin Peaks. He relies way too much on: a) very slowly paced scenes to create "atmosphere" and "tension" that end up just dragging the whole film to a screeching halt, b) breaking the rules of reality in a way that empowers the "it's whatever you want it to be" crowd instead of presenting a cogent story and c) a repetitive attempt to parody a mythological view of America with a fake-50s style that just seems hackneyed after the 10th time he does it.  It's not a technical incompetence, it's just the choices he makes to tell his stories that do nothing for me. Other people like him. Fine. But to put him in the pantheon of Great Directors seems a stretch to say the least. Pretty sure I'll never bother with one of his movies ever again.    Agreed. But still a good track!

She's gotten better, but I still can't really watch her, can't put my finger on it, but I like my news as serious as a heart attack and she just seems kind of smug and amateurish.    Rachel Maddow tries to be Jon Stewart and Ed Murrow at the same time and it is awful.    You're looking for objective reasons for value judgments, and it just doesn't work like that or else there would be no disagreement about artistic works. I can't "objectively" convince you his films are bad, and you won't "objectively" convince me his films are good. You already said what I don't like about his films, you like, we like different things. Art is like that. I dislike the fact that I don't see a coherent vision in his work and I think they move too slowly and you like that. We don't have to like the same things. I hate Rothko, other people find merit in his work. That's fine.   It's art, the criticism is going to be subjective. When you're analyzing a movie, you're doing it from your point of view. Reasonable people can disagree about things.    Godspeed You! Black Emperor (Goddo Supdo Y! Burakku Enper) is a 1976 Japanese black-and-white 16 mm documentary film, 90 minutes long, by director Mitsuo Yanagimachi, which follows the exploits of young Japanese motorcyclists, the "Black Emperors". The 1970s in Japan saw the rise of a motorcycling movement called the bszoku, which drew the interest of the media. The movie follows a member of the "Black Emperors" motorcycle club and his interaction with his parents after he gets in trouble with the police.  The Canadian post-rock band Godspeed You! Black Emperor took their name from the film.      In general, with artistic endeavours, we get out of it what we put into it, and for me, Lynch just doesn't fit that mould. I get less out of it than I put into it. He just doesn't work for me at all. I don't have a problem with ambiguity or surrealism, I love Jodorowsky's work, but I think there still needs to be a cogent vision in the work for it to have merit. If it's largely indecipherable, I find it tedious. I don't think that's the case for his early work, but as is usually the case, directors just don't get better with age. As I said, having just seen Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive, bits of which I enjoyed, I just think he's well past his prime.      No, I don't have a problem with ambiguity in art in general, but ambiguity and meaninglessness are two different things. Saying that something is "open to a wide array of interpretations" seems like a bit of a cop-out. I think Lynch is less "open to interpretation" and more "no real intention or meaning or serious thought or actual ideas". Again, I don't think he's completely shit as a director, but more like the emperor with no clothes. To me, there's just no there there and to place him anywhere near Kurosawa or Kubrick or Wilder or Scorsese or Leone or whoever seems like a stretch to say the least.   This suggests, by definition, that his movies have no meaning. That's a problem in my book.    On the topic of David Lynch in general...Eraserhead is original and interesting, but hardly a masterpiece. Blue Velvet is excellent, and Dune is actually pretty good. But in general, David Lynch is a second-rate director whose reputation far, far outweighs his actual contribution to the medium. Lost Highway was almost unwatchable and Mulholland Drive, like most of his movies, isn't interesting enough to warrant further research to actually find out what it's about. His over-dedication to atmosphere means most of his movies are too long and generally pretty fucking boring.   His reviews of the prequels are better than the prequels.   This was a superb book, highly recommended for everyone.   Relevant:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1Xx3XGCZsY     Good.

[Trinity and Beyond: The Atomic Bomb Movie.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_and_Beyond)   It's like he's been taking pointers from Rob Ford.    Holy Mountain gets all the attention, but for me, this is Jodorowsky's best film. Best to watch in the highest quality version you can find. A true masterpiece. Unique cinema.    "About as much fun as painting a wagon."    [The Bet](http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/Bet.shtml) by Anton Chekhov.   Another great Chris Rock bit about marriage/divorce:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsSD7CP5hxQ     Blood Meridian.  *"Men are born for games. Nothing else. Every child knows that play is nobler than work. He knows too that the worth or merit of a game is not inherent in the game itself but rather in the value of that which is put at hazard. Games of chance require a wager to have meaning at all. Games of sport involve the skill and strength of the opponents and the humiliation of defeat and the pride of victory are in themselves sufficient stake because they inhere in the worth of the principals and define them. But trial of chance or trial of worth all games aspire to the condition of war for here that which is wagered swallows up game, player, all.*   *Suppose two men at cards with nothing to wager save their lives. Who has not heard such a tale? A turn of the card. The whole universe for such a player has labored clanking to this moment which will tell if he is to die at that mans hand or that man at his. What more certain validation of a mans worth could there be? This enhancement of the game to its ultimate state admits no argument concerning the notion of fate. The selection of one man over another is a preference absolute and irrevocable and it is a dull man indeed who could reckon so profound a decision without agency or significance either one. In such games as have for their stake the annihilation of the defeated the decisions are quite clear. This man holding this particular arrangement of cards in his hand is thereby removed from existence. This is the nature of war, whose stake is at once the game and the authority and the justification. Seen so, war is the truest form of divination. It is the testing of ones will and the will of another within that larger will which because it binds them is therefore forced to select. War is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence. War is god."*   You don't recover that easily from [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd1IFjBNNVo).    I had to watch the BBC series again just to get it out of my system. They hold up remarkably well.    Just reporting back. Finally saw HHGG. Sam Rockwell was great as always but that was easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrific. The directors should be ashamed. Absolutely terrible.    The answer will vary on who you ask. The documentary [Waco: The Rules of Engagement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4scgRAJxWc) answers some questions.    Relevant:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znQe9nUKzvQ       This fall, it'll be 20 years since Pulp Fiction!    It's  a solid documentary. A little too much focus on ODB (for obvious reasons) but well worth a watch.    Ha, a friend of mine said exactly that last night. Didn't like the movie, but really liked Sam as Zaphod. I'm becoming a bigger and bigger Sam Rockwell fan every time I see him, I'm going to have to check it out just for him.         Love your comics dude, keep it up!          Which is exactly my point. He's popular, he has a large audience, CNN would benefit by hiring him and Stewart would benefit by moving to a better time slot with a global audience. Why do you think Stewart would lose viewers?     I think this quote from the story accurately sums up the problem with Morgan:  *"Crossing an ocean for a replacement for Larry King, who had ratings problems of his own near the end, was probably not a great idea to begin with. For a cable news station like CNN, major stories are like oxygen. When something important or scary happens in America, many of us have an immediate reflex to turn on CNN. When I find Mr. Morgan telling me what it all means, I have a similar reflex to dismiss what he is saying. It is difficult for him to speak credibly on significant American events because, after all, he just got here."*  And this is not just some knee-jerk anti-British reaction (Personally, I'd like to see Russell Brand take his spot!) but let's be real, if you're going to have a prime-time American news show talking about American events, it would help to have an American in that chair. Maybe now they'll stop fucking around and give the job to Jon Stewart like they should have in the first place.   Lawrence O'Donnell explains why sitting out the midterms is a TERRIBLE move for Dems:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZQww4xm5Os    I love Taibbi's takedown of Friedman:  http://nypress.com/flathead/      You are completely white washing his statements about Jews.   No, I'm not and I resent the charge that I would, for some reason, defend an anti-Semite. Again, take a look at the videos I've posted on youtube, find even one that you could call anti-Semitic. The closest you're going to get is the interview with [Dr. Kenneth Clark](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9C_e0EUbas) where he is defending the NOI from charges of antisemitism.  Likewise, I'd be happy to email you (or anyone else) the 800-pages of speeches, debates and interviews that I compiled. You will not find one single instance of antisemitism. Not. One. In fact, what you will find are statements like this:  *"If you have read what the Honorable Elijah Muhammad has written and he has written much, I dont think you can find an article where he has ever pointed out the Jew as an exploiter of the black man. He speaks of the exploiter. Period. He doesnt break it down in terms of Frenchmen or an Englishmen or a Jew or a German, he speaks of the exploiter and sometimes the man who is the most guilty of exploitation will think you are pointing the finger at him and put out the propaganda that youre anti-this or anti-that, we make no distinction between exploitation and exploiter." (Debate with Bayard Rustin, 1960)*  Later, after he left the NOI, he stated:  "Since I learned the truth in Mecca, **my dearest friends have come to include all kinds  some Christians, Jews**, Buddhists, Hindus, agnostics, and even atheists! I have friends who are called capitalists, Socialists, and Communists! Some of my friends are moderates, conservatives, extremists  some are even Uncle Toms! My friends today are black, brown, red, yellow, and white!" (Autobiography of Malcolm X, p. 375)  You are confusing Malcolm X with Farrakhan who I think, quite clearly, is an anti-Semite.   In the meantime, may I ask what those people being Jewish had to do with his claim that they were taking advantage of the black community?   Are you denying that some of the people who exploited black people were Jewish? Are you denying that some of them were Italian? Some were Polish? Some were black? It's a simple fact that some black people were exploited by some Jewish people and some Italians and some Poles and some Blacks. The fact that they were Jewish does not make them immune to criticism. I get the impression that you think any criticism of anyone who is Jewish is automatically antisemitism. It is not.   As someone who has uploaded [several hours](http://www.youtube.com/user/train_subject8978) of Malcolm X speeches and debates to youtube and compiled an Ebook of over [800 pages](http://malcolmxfiles.blogspot.ca/p/malcolm-x-e-book.html) of speeches, debates and interviews, I think it's safe to say that I'm fairly familiar with Malcolm X. Thus, it seems absurd to suggest that I'm not familiar with his beliefs when he was in the Nation of Islam. You can hear Malcolm X repudiate his previous position [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgqIek2TYvg), [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDQ2EKmc3g) and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xXB48l-OlE). You can read my own take on it [here](http://malcolmxfiles.blogspot.ca/p/the-men-who-killed-malcolm-x.html). You can criticize him for beliefs that he rejected if you like, but that seems like cherry-picking facts in order to make a point, which seems fundamentally dishonest to me.   Sorry, but that's complete nonsense. You can take a look at either the [several hours of footage that I've uploaded](http://www.youtube.com/user/train_subject8978), or if you like, you can ask for a copy of the free Ebook that I created with over [800 pages of speeches, debates and interviews](http://malcolmxfiles.blogspot.ca/p/malcolm-x-e-book.html), and I challenge you to find this "outspoken anti-semitism". This is just more of the same slander that's been going on for almost fifty years. There are some speeches were he is critical of Jewish people who own buildings where black people were being charged exorbitant rent, but that was about the exorbitant rent, not the fact that they were Jewish. In fact, in several speeches, he uses Jews as a model for black people, when he was arguing for a separate black state. The claim that Malcolm X was an outspoken anti-semite is ridiculous. BTW, [Manning Marable's book was crap](http://mxmission.blogspot.ca/2011/04/paper-tiger-manning-marables-poison-pen.html).   wikibot who is Billie Holiday?       Yes he did. But events like the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church made him start questioning his 'love thy enemy' philosophy. Towards the end he started aligning himself with organizations like the SNCC which also advocated self-defense.    I do not understand your claim.    Contrary to popular belief, Malcolm X NEVER preached violence. He preached self-defense. If someone comes at you with a gun or a knife or a rope with the intention of doing you harm, you have the right to defend yourself. This was, unfortunately, a novel concept in 1960. If you read up on MLK, you will see that he was becoming more and  more aligned with Malcolm X and vice versa. It is a fallacy to suggest that they were on opposite sides of the fence. Thanks for the comment.    It is disappointing, to say the least, that the perception of Malcolm X as a racist and a hatemonger remains. It is unsurprising that someone as intelligent as Malcolm X could easily forsee this viewpoint. As he wrote in his autobiography:  *"I want you to watch and see if I'm not right in what I say: that the white man in his press, is going to identify me with "hate." He will make use of me dead, as he has made use of me alive, as a convenient symbol of "hatred"and that will help him to escape facing the truth."*   While I certainly understand the internet's general bias against self-promotion, I must post [this essay that I wrote](http://malcolmxfiles.blogspot.ca/p/the-men-who-killed-malcolm-x.html) several years ago. Perhaps it will help change the minds of people who still identify him with 'hate'. At the very least, if you're going to slander him, you should read his autobiography and get your facts straight. I run the largest collection of [Malcolm X videos on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/train_subject8978). I would suggest that those who think Malcolm X was a racist and a hatemonger listen to the man himself and see that any such depiction is absurd, insulting and simply wrong. He was certainly a vocal opponent of white hate while he was in the NOI, but he repudiated some of those views after he left. I maintain that many of those criticisms of White America were valid then and are valid now.  Thanks to the OP for the post.   Yeah, just a bad film joke...

He's sort of made to be the protagonist of the movie, but in the book he's clearly unhinged. One of the problems in the movie is that he's got that sort of cool, gravelly voice that makes him sound like Clint Eastwood or something, but in the book his voice is described as completely monotone, devoid of any emotion, because he's severely disturbed. He's also a proto-fascist, who identifies very strongly with the right-wing. BTW, he's based on Ditko's [Mr. A](http://ditkocultist.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/graphic-illusions-mr-a0001.jpg).   As a big fan of the comic book, I just don't think they could've made a Hollywood movie that would satisfy me. I'm just too much a fan of the comic as it is. Having said that, there were two things that the movie did brilliantly, one was The Comedian, they really nailed him. The other was Dr. Manhattan. His flashback sequence explaining his origin with the quiet, calm narration and the Philip Glass music was really, really well done.

I just don't want her to look at me differently, as if I'm just some fucked up son, because I always look so happy around the house, and I'm afraid to imagine things differently. However, I know I need deep psychological treatment while I'm still young (I'm almost eighteen), but I just don't know how to tell her.   Any ideas? Any people who experienced something similar to this? Please share your stories/advices.   Thank you. Any comment would be helpful.    This is just bad. Nothing more.    Does it work for WhatsApp?    If light travels faster than the speed of sound, how come I can hear the guy in the BMW behind me honk before the light turns green?

Alright, I'm putting aside 60$ for this summer.       Yes, he does. Why do you ask?   Call me an asshole, but I find it so dumb when someone has to express how much they're dying of laughter right now.    So I've been working on a Hebrew novel for some years now, and I've been collecting all kinds of plot-related notes and writing its plot-related scenes, but I realized there's a problem with that. Well, I should've imagined that eventually I would have too much of notes and scenes that organizing them into a single document would hardly be possible, but I feel that I should tackle this ASAP.  So, dedicated writers of Reddit, how should I approach this? Any effective ways/tools that could perhaps help me during the process?   I've been feeling this forever. I call it 'happy depression', and I've been trying to figure out how it could be possible. It's the best feeling ever though, for sure.    Something as "I look for something casual, but hey, life's surprising". I dunno.       Don't procrastinate.  This has a new meaning for me now. Write your fucking novel for God's sake, just sit on the fucking chair and write it. Sentence by sentence. Scene by scene. WRITE.   I keep each gram in its original, tiny bag. Is that cool enough? Should that last until next week-2 weeks from now?   I bought 2 fresh grams last week, and I've been planning to smoke them next week. I keep them closed in that small bag in a fair temperature (25 degrees celsius, to be exact). Is that okay?    GODDAMN IT I THOUGHT JUSTIN VERNON JUST RELEASED SOME NEW MUSIC FOR BON IVER. FOR GOD'S SAKE. ^What ^a ^beard ^though.   It's not about your appearance. I've full confidence in my appearance and talk to really hot girls, and yet I could relate to everything you said in your first paragraph.   It doesn't matter what you look like, our minds will always find some silly imperfections. That's what they do.    Personally, I never felt like I don't deserve to be happy.    Thank you. This made me smile so much.   I think my mom would support me, and I could tell her that I've been writing my own novel, and that I've a girlfriend. This would all be very new to her, and a little embarrassing for me but hey, if this is what it takes to get better, I'm willing to do this.   I'm probably gonna get anxious about this soon, but right now I've hope. I don't quite know how to explain this, but I feel better just thinking about it.   I'm gonna PM you, and hopefully I could ask for further assistance and keep you updated?   What kind of therapy do you go to?   I may tell them I'm depressed, that I really do have a mental illness and that I wanna go see a doctor. I'm only afraid of what if they ask questions, and eventually I'm gonna say that it all began with a girl.   It's gonna sound pathetic, but when I think about it now, I think I could work this out. Maybe I'd tell my mother, I think she'd understand me more. I'd ask her to keep it a secret - and just visit a doctor to see what's wrong and how we can continue from there.   What do you think?    I've spoken with many people who had anxiety, read about the topic, taken several tests, despite the fact that I think I'm aware of what I'm feeling isn't normal.   And this won't work, my mother's a doctor and a psychiatrist would cost money. I'm gonna have to keep my depression to myself, at least until I'm on my own.    I know... what part made you realize that?   Admitting you're depressed isn't a simple thing. I'm afraid my parents would feel sorry for me, and they're so old-fashioned they wouldn't understand it anyway. It's almost like confessing you're gay to religious parents.    I suffer from anxiety and clinical depression. I'd fucking love to see a therapist, but the truth is I can't.   	33

This game has far to go before release time. The good thing is that I imagine even if it comes out 2 years from now, it will still maintain novelty due to its physically based combat and dungeon crawler aesthetic.     I think its a prelude   Yeah, maybe German people were kept just as unaware and ignorant as our own people today.    Even if you find a relationship with a girl, it won't satisfy. Why don't you try something radically different? Give up all the bullshit of being in college and meandering through life and go in search of God. Pick a road and follow it. Just keep going. Don't stop till your experiences have given you such an appreciation for life that you can't but be thankful for what God has given you and even more thankful for His grace on a wretch like you, that He came down from his throne as a god and humbled himself to human form and to die for your spiritual disgust. You soon will find a realization that your physical attributes are nothing in the eternity found in your spirit and companionship with the Creator of All Things. Suicide is fucking lazy. It's cheap and requires no effort other than wallowing in the deception that Satan has cast upon you. Living is a true accomplishment. So why don't you go show up every random good looking bastard with a girl friend by living a life that is beyond the mundane and trance like. BE FREE! BE FREE! BE FREE!

How dare you criticize Oblama.   New Zealand    Most likely correct       Well, national guard  will most likely not see duty, but who knows. Just depends if you want to put yourself in a position where you may have to "neutralize" a target, or enemy, or random bystander they think has an IED, or seize an opium field or oil field completely unrelated to "fighting terrorism". I personally don't agree with the military, especially the marines, it places people in morally compromising positions that may or may not lead to horrendous sins, some of which cause some to question their humanity.    Do you think the soldiers at that time were more of a police force rather than a military?                     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpaRouocBes t=2m0s      k    Yeah, how dark?   I do get frustrated that Christian folk in the US seem to worship Israel as a manifestation of the likeness of Jesus Himself. In reality, all throughout the Bible, God constantly condemns Israel for turning from God, allowing its enemies to rule over Israel when it is especially far from God. Obviously God never gives up on Israel, but allows them wallow in the free choice of sin like any other sinner. I see current times as no different, Israel, for the most part, does not hold the Christian Messiah as authoritative and certainly does not turn to God alone, given that the land is becoming more secular by the hour. Much like the united states.    I just felt like Halo hadn't changed much and the novelty wore off from when I was in high school.    It is obvious that the United States shows an insurmountable amount of favoritism and biased to Israel. My question is why?  I know this subreddit can be full of memes and click-bait at times, so I want to take this opportunity now for anyone with legitimate knowledge and sources to please share with the rest of us. What are the direct links between the United States and the embarrassingly blatant influence Israel has on our politics, culture and military?  Who are the people? How is the money distributed? How did it get this way? And, where will it lead the US?   I don't ask this to start argument, I earnestly ask this to be informed.

Heinlein's Future History stories, the short story originally appeared in The Saturday Evening Post (February 8, 1947) What are your thoughts on this uncanny representation of pioneer space travel?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MGXHHOPXEQ   It was an example, and a commonly used form of demonic communication. I understand you perceive this as a cliche, but you must begin to see yourself as an eternal soul within the shell of your body. The beings you come in communication are ancient creatures, long since separated from their bodily temples, cast to float within the darkness. They have nothing more than eternal hatred flowing through their existence in hopes to separate you from the eternal God. They have nothing else. We humans are easily led astray. Do not be one of the many.       Lucifer was the leader of worship within Heaven before he was cast out. He knows makes you tick. We humans are built to worship something, anything, whatever that idol may be. Also, your comparison is not fair, Ouija boards are an attempt to come in direct contact with spiritual entities. Heavy Metal music, pending the energy or theme within its message, is not an overt spiritual activity. Though it all begins with a seed sown. Do not be naive, friend.    Often as Christians, we speak of living a godly life but forget about that which exists around us at all times, the spiritual realm. The spiritual realm is the true realm to which all of us will exist within once we exit our bodies and are connected to the Father. Yet, we often go day to day, praying and speaking to God without realizing the true power of prayer and our authority that we are granted and protected by in the power and authority of our Savior, Yeshua, Jesus Christ. We have angels that follow us everywhere we go, who protect us from demonic onslaught and can be commanded in the name of Christ to intervene in godly manners and spiritual issues that are worthy of God's purpose. There are evil forces that will latch on to us, should we allow Sin to enter into our life willfully. The power of these angels are subdued and held back due to our willingness to Sin. This is God's desire to allow so, so that we shall be humbled to reliance on Him alone. We as human souls are also powerless within the spiritual realm without protection and guidance from the Lord. We shall not enter the kingdom of Heaven or survive the haze of the spiritual dark realms without our savior by our side. If you play with occult activities such as Ouija boards, you may perceive them as simply a game, yet you open portals for demons to enter your life and your bloodline. Do not mess with that which you are not meant to partake in. If you have fallen into this, turn from it, and pray in the authority of Christ to cast away and destroy this evil that has entered your life through portals and footholds. If you attempt to astral project, you will be deceived by the demons into believing you are in control and have power. But in fact, you will be a mere human swimming in a vast shark infested sea. You will be bound to being eaten alive. Without the mercy and support from our creator, our author of life, our lover of souls, we are doomed to fall into deep sin. Friends, be aware of all that exists around you, bound and determined to drag you away from the love that Christ graciously pours upon our weeping souls. His love abounds eternally, and simply requires a humbling of pride to enter into a kingdom that stands strong forever. Claim this love that Jesus has for you, claim this authority that Jesus shields you with. Our eyes do not perceive the apparent message of the spiritual realm as they once were intended to, yet, this realm exists and there is a war waging around you for your eternal soul. Stand firm on the Lord - know that He will never leave, abandon or turn from you. Call upon his name with trust and sincerity. The greatest spoils of this world are rotting, as we speak, in the face of the eternal God. Be well and turn your sorrowful eyes to the King of Kings, the LOVER OF YOUR SOUL.

What are your thoughts on this terrifyingly mysterious classic?      wtf is this fucking bullshit? propoganda? on reddit? get out of town         I hate mainstream reddit. I hate the hivemind and I hate how unbelievably predictable they all are. How is it possible that such a large majority of minds all center around one particular topic, such as supporting vaccinations and countless other mindless bullshit (such as their obsession with Neil De Gressie Tyson, "science" and Cats). Yet, there is an insane amount of confirmation, circlejerk bias that people on reddit are "intelligent". You would think, just statistically, that there would be a varied split on opinions of popular topics, yet when you scroll through a comments section, all differing opinions are downvoted to oblivion.   Is there some sort of robot algorithm that upvotes all posts that fall within the calculated perspective necessary to be viewed on reddit or have we, as a culminated population, truly created a singular hivemind that is so indoctrinated to believe one particular side of an argument or perspective that the system just perpetuates itself forward. Is it a fear of being downvoted? Does anyone actually care about "karma" or another internet person's opinion on themself?   If anyone could shine some light on this topic, you'd be more than welcome to speak your mind.    I'm so astonipshed   What if none of us give a shit?         I don't see how crossfit could be generalized like this. The act of crossfit is a workout regimen involving power lifting, some olympic lifts, and organized circuit work outs.

Generalizing crossfitters to be douchebags based on this guy is about the same as generalizing all youtubers to be blatant retards because you watched PewDiePie.

The NEA is the nation's largest teachers union, with 3 million members.  That's a lot of votes up for grabs.

Maybe you should find a better sports bar. But if the movies works for you, more power to you.    I'm sure the energy companies will pay Republicans so stop it.   	139
    Someone watches Dexter      Edit: For anyone the least bit interested in the rant below, I came across some answers today after a conversation with a teacher of mine.  When talking about anarchy (left-winged) we do assume it is utilitarian (I apologize for my ignorance in my rant; from my perspective I thought happiness was more individualist, but that's for right-winged anarchy) Furthermore, we also assume that under anarchy, communes will form in order to respectfully address everyone's beliefs and thus do away with private property in these communes. (I find this very similar to the Kibbutz) however private property still exists in right-winged anarchy (yet is in virtually impossible to have a lot of private property)  Therefore, happiness will be achieved as so desired within a commune. Private property doesn't exist and neither does government which would, in theory, eradicate desire and greed because it is the government and private property that brews inhuman attributes in a human-being.  With this said, I'm hoping an anarchist will help verify this!  Additionally, will an anarchist please explain how these communes will interact? If they do interact or how an individual eventually finds him/herself with a new belief or quest for happiness and thus wants to go to another commune, how can he/she do so? How does innovation occur?  Thanks!  I've been obsessing over left-wing ideologies for quite some time the past few months and have been toying with many questions to ask Reddit. I wouldn't call myself an anarchist, socialist, libertarian , or a communist, but I believe in equality, freedom, and happiness, and I don't believe in a corrupt capitalist system where private wealth is brewed by exploiting impoverished and unprivileged populations. So, I'm here at "debate an anarchist" where I'm hoping someone may help me out. I should begin by saying I'm not well educated in all of the literature that exists on left-winged ideologies. I watch debates, read excerpts, essays, articles, blogs, and listen to quite a bit of folk punk, so hopefully I won't get brutally attacked for any of my ignorance.   With my understanding, anarchism is the polar end of the spectrum for left beliefs (although others wouldn't place anarchism on a political compass at all). I understand that anarchism fosters atheism and is essentially nihilistic. Government doesn't exist and individuals will have (in theory) maximum freedom to partake in activities that would promote happiness (outside of basic necessities) due to an absence of a hierarchy.  I have a perspective that happiness should be achieved by everyone; however, not in a utilitarian way, but a more individualistic approach, which I think can be achieved through anarchy (I'm pretty sure this is the whole foundation of anarchy). So here, anarchy would work in theory if every individual took responsibility for his/hers actions.  So I'm confused on a few things. --Please prepare yourself for a wave of ignorance.-- How can we be sure that another mans freedom won't infringe upon another mans freedoms? And how do you approach this question through a nihilistic lens Education? Please explain how to ensure equality (if education still existed in schools) ex. Tolstoy experimental school or Goodman's belief on an external schooling  I like to say I'm an agnostic atheist (I don't believe that God created the us, but that we created God and that it would be selfish for me to deny the existence of something more intelligent than me thus I believe another life-form could be more intelligent and therefore God) however, I do believe that man invented God out of necessity and for some people religion is necessary. I've read a bit about this and there are certainly some individuals who are religious and anarchist, but wouldn't religion in anarchy go against the whole theory? And once we introduce new beliefs aren't we going against theory and potentially bringing in new dilemmas that could infringe upon another persons freedom?  I imagine I do believe anarchy is the solution to happiness in a society ( I especially like spiritual anarchism) but it's a topic you will become quickly ostracized for mentioning. So I've mentioned some pretty basic questions here.      favorite track: Goatwhore      The last page really got me. Then I reread them all, and then they all really got me.   	7

 There will be no question in my post. I just wanted to share that you Mr. Schwarzenegger inspired me to start fitness   bodybuilding. I was a newcomer to fitness and was searching for articles on the web and saw something like: Arnold Schwarzenegger - Mr. Olympia. I opened the page because... well I have grown with your movies, because my father always watched action movies and yeah terminator predator true lies (hope I'm not mistaking the name it's been a long time since I watched that movie which reminds me of downloading the soundtrack). Anyways back to the topic: so I saw a picture of your body from one of the competitions and said: if that man did it I can do it too. I was like you when you saw the picture or Reg Park. And I started reading your bio. Then bought the new encyclopedia of modern bodybuilding and yeah you can guess how it continues. Also wanted to tell you that you are not only an inspiration but you are the perfect example of a person who reached his goals in life (and is still reaching). I have learned a lot.  I will never forget one sentence: "You can't climb the ladder of success with your hands in your pockets." Thank you for everything :)   How did you make your Asura look so cool? :D   Hey your Sylvari looks amazing :D. I like the colours and everything.  I too have a Sylvari. Made him a week ago. It's almost the same as the Sylvari Guardian look you get when you create your character for the first time. But yet again - love those colours of yours  	3
 Well 3000 is quite a large sum, but that doesn't make $800 nothing! $800 is like a whole new PC!    Maybe i haven't been here long enough, because this hit me out of nowhere.   *passive aggressive content creator*   I'm glad someone thought that idea was good! I really think it'd be neat for higher pop servers,   Aww, this made me really excited for a second.   Yeah, you can almost instantly tell shady people from not shady people. Pne time a friend and I are at NWAF with AUG's and full gear, roaming. We go into a barrack and meet two people. We had our guns drawn and so did they. Something in their voice told me they were honest people. About five minutes later in the NWAF firestation, two other people show up shouting "friendly, friendly" and walked up to us. Something in their words or movements told me something was up, and i said "we have to go, sorry!" and we ran off. If you get a bad feeling, trust your instincts.   I hope rule 3 is something about not making posts about getting hacked, because that is literally half of posts here right now.   How on earth did they manage that? Thats awesome!   THANK YOU! I love this game to death, but it ends up being really hard to tell my friends that the zombies still glitch through walls, and thats why they died, two and a half YEARS after it was released. At this point most of my friends will give up playing, join me in a few months, die walking up stairs or something like that, and give up again. Some really basic stuff needs to be sorted out.   Have a Camelbak (or water bladder) that attaches to your military backpack (or vest) without taking up any space (much like a holster). It holds 2 liters and can be used while moving, rather than stopping.  Also the Coyote pack from Arma 2, that spawns at nato heli crashes with an area of 30 (6x5).   Also, spawning in fresh with a battery, flashlight, AND a walkie-talkie, to bring back side chat in a way, would be pretty neat.  EDIT: Camelbak not Camelpak   My only concern is that these new infected are going to be as buggy as the old ones (which is what it seems so far), but far faster and in higher numbers. If the new AI is released with a high number of bugs it could ruin the game, for me at least.  	11
    A look at japan and its suicide rate, one of the highest in the developed world. Worth reading but obviously be warned.      might just wait for the film   damn I am drinking my gin with aldi diet lemonade      sadly old news   I love egg salad   It really doesn't. It's pretty much identical to the rest of reddit.    There seem to be a lot of people here who only go on /r/soccer and one or two other subreddits, avoiding the defaults entirely.  That is not unique.   I know what it is about.   If the /r/soccer mods don't share those grievances then why would they shut it down?  Already explained several times. Solidarity, make the voice of the admins across reddit heard, and as it seems as this thing expands a bit the users who are obviously pissed as well.  Burying head in the sand is all this is.  And I am not even talking about fully dark, just 12 hours, or even allow discussion about it instead of yanking posts.       If you know why then why are you not participating as well?  Even if only for a short time?   We have no reason to go dark.  Yes you do. I already explaining it to you.    None of the defaults have asked us for solidarity  Shouldn't need to.   we have no issue with the admins.  That doesn't change a single sausage.    taking my ball etc etc  jesus   Seems to be one of many, but you still haven't answered my question, why did you not go dark at all?  Or even investigate why so many defaults have done so?   Response to the comment thread in general. Other user talking about internet anarchists.  Not really the issue so stop getting off track.   I understand irrational hive internet warriors complaining but this is not that.     it is about reddit and /r/soccer is a part of reddit and your account and your opinions and voice are too  thinking you are special and an island and above the rest of us is cringe  grow up   no it is an issue for the whole of reddit  look at /r/all now  you think that is angry teenagers complaining?  sigh  also good job responding to questions, well done     You have no idea what is going on do you?  SRD top post I think has a lot of the info  Go read and then when you have some information come back   You are not separate in any way.  Grow up.   12 hours and they'll be back  things are getting trippy, why so many people are complaining    obviously yes, but this will be removed and mods dont seem to want to explain why  really disturbing     Hive mentality. Some loud people spoke the rest have to maintain their geezer image.  But that really is getting off topic.  Point is people should, and the mods should have went dark for at least 12 hours   Not doing so is cowardice    Or they are pretending they don't, which is very likely, but either way I am shocked that mods didn't take some action.     No I said you are pathetic for ignoring what is going on with the very website you use.  Burying your head in the sand.     Bullshit. Fucking snowflakes on here thinking they are special is no different to the rest of reddit.   Yes it is. Stop thinking you are separate from the rest of reddit is hysterical.   Yes it is, one run by volunteers etc etc etc     Not really the point of what is going on. People on here seem to be talking about it without knowing the facts.   This is one of the funniest things I have seen on reddit ever.  Funniest or scariest I am not sure.  No, it isn't.   Please tell me ye don't actually believe this.   And the flat out bullshit comments about not knowing what is going on and all of that.       srd has loads of posts on it explaining it in detail   why not?   beer   No it isn't. Not at all   I love the fact you have completely ignored the main point of my response   your transfer news on reddit... which at the moment has long standing problems that need to be dealt with  So if you do have other accounts and have been here a while you should know what is going on and why the mods are pissed off and that this is not just about someone being fired  of course you would know that wouldn't you  instead your response is I don't care what goes on I just want my transfer news  that's pretty pathetic    most people on here think this is just about someone being fired  and they also seem to think this sub and its users are somewhat special snowflakes separate from the rest of reddit     some places reporting what had happened  but again this is not just about her being fired, if anyone on here bothered to read up about it  jesus christ like   your transfer news on reddit... which at the moment has long standing problems that need to be dealt with  2 month old account as well  christ     they'll get out quickly    true true mate   totally worth 5000 upboats  jesus   Interesting look at how one city is combating those who are running off brainwashed to join the fight in the middle east.               Watch rise of the machines backwards and you will be fine.   heard ad on the radio there, cant recall hearing one before, with the voiceover mentioinig cameron    oh god no, please no, another justification for hacks to defend why it took 4 night courses, 12 how to books and 27 redrafts over 6 years  to finally finish their masterpiece 'Drive Fast' which is totally different to Fast and Furious although it's exactly the same and probably somehow even worse  *'I just need to understand the human condition man...'*   bang, nail, head   typical pete   Maybe leave op have his say or something?

Point me to the last one that had a script that wasn't terminal?   it would take a few hours   awesome   that's fucking hysterical    good, thing was a joke   fucking cringe on reddit  yeah the majority can't see it because of where they are from  so much cringe  the rest of us are looking at it shaking our heads    my face   so 90m offer 70 contract?    or what?

I thought he looked promising for a while, before the move to chelsea      betrayal is a strong word   Did you read what I just wrote?  I just explained it.  Right there.  In the very post you responded to.     Most people who jump on downvoted comments are indeed trying to score karma so yes you probably were.   or perhaps because most videos posted with similar titles (irish something doing something) are either comical or tragic?  and I clicked it thinking it will be one of those and instead its just people talking about game development  but go on with the edgy cunt comments, I'm sure you'll reap some karma with that     why was I expecting something tragic?   no she is pretty successful          lol   poor baby   man banega    great player, honest, works his ass off   top kek   Godzilla Vs.

PRICE?   I think both of ye have points.  For me it is the constant nature of the updates, the almost immediate call and response.  When there was time between such things I think someone in a certain mindset could focus better and do their own thing.  Now half the time you feel like giving up because you heard X Y and Z already did it.   Not sure but man did they unleash the hate   I posted something from there recently and got a torrent of abuse with links   everything is an internet success    it's grand   isn't Latino-Review  notoriously bullshit a lot of the time?   Yeah no   hello   Don't bother. Guy is circlejerk as far as I can see, although I think he actually believes all the nonsense he is saying.  I gave a coherent polite response, he basically in our conversation has now tried to dismiss it twice, ignored it when I responded to his concerns (had to do it again and repeatedly ask him if there were any more), and failed to bring up any relevant points  then I  watched as the conversation lead to a fixation on the word 'junk', to some attempt at entering a philosophical convo about the nature of knowing, and then onto the easy dismissal of both of us being too tired.  Bizarre creature.   Scary thing is I think he really believes he is not just iamverysmart he actually believes he is having a brilliant discussion on reddit and just destroying everyone.  Avoid.    Yeah I am.  Downvotes, hiding, negative karma, eomtional aspects, delays, all parts of downvoting.   Man you really need some rest.   No I am pretty sure everything I said was perfectly coherent and correct.      No I am pretty confident in my posts. More so - 100%.     I'm proposing removing the downvotes, that was the very first thing I said.  And downvotes and hiding go hand in hand.  WTF man.        And is that going to change when all people have is upvotes?   Yes, I already explained this.   The posts which go against the hive for example will still be visible without having to click anything, not get downvoted into negatives, which hides them, and if a low karma user can subject them to that delay in posting.  I already said this.          No, it is impossible. That is a fact of life. No one can truly know what another feels and thinks.   But again, it's got nothing to do with my ideas about removing downvotes.    I wrote a lengthy reply there.  The long response? Yeah it doesn't address my points at all.   I wouldn't call it "criticism" as I haven't heard of a single decent proposed alternative. Without a suggestion, it's not criticism, it's just (to put it bluntly) whining.  I gave you one, showed how it works, showed the benefits, and answered your concerns.  I really don't understand what you are looking for.         Yes to an extent.   I am more concerned with the negatives, take /r/movies for example, go and give a 200 word post about how you think QT is shallow and you will get downvoted, an innocuous comment about Marvel will get you downvoted etc   I suppose part of my issue is that removing downvotes means we can't downvote these things to help get actual commentary to the top, but that's already not happening.   IMO the hive is too strong   Do I trust the mods. Statistically, over the hive, I would say yes.  I have mentioned a true appeal system on reddit before. I'd love to see one in place.    And to what end? What's really bad about the current system? All you provided was the adjective "junk".  What is wrong is that perfectly fine opinions are constantly getting downvoted because the hive disagrees with them.  In essence, using your terminology, they are being 'punished' for expressing their genuine opinion, because the hive does not agree with their POV.  We are not talking about anything offensive or anything like that, just a genuine opinion expressed cleanly - that is what I am talking about.  But I've already said that as well. So I am confused as to why you accused me of just saying 'junk'.  I think my point has been quite clear from the start. Removing downvotes so that peoples genuine opinions which go against the hive remain and are not 'punished' by the hive.     But it's impossible. So instead you concentrate on the results of  rather than knowing the actual reasons.   It happens, what can we do about it - that's what we are talking about.  Put that aside, it really is not the issue.  I cannot truly know why another person does anything.  but - I do know that plenty of perfectly sound opinions are downvoted in certain threads as they go against the hive.  That's all I can work with.    You said I supposedly didn't answer your concerns - I showed you again my answers (which were already in the thread.)  I'm confused as to what you are trying to get at.  And I am being polite as hell about it so can you please explain have I dealt with your questions about the downsides of no downvotes? or where there others?  Because your responses now seem to be pushing towards the philosophical     Removal (by mods) work, but that's Placing a lot of burden on the mods, and   Not really punishing the poster, because deletion does nothing to your profile.  This is what I got. Is this what you are referring to?  Mods - that is their job, and they can get more if needed, already addressed that.  " If more mods are needed get them, it's not a paid position, plenty of willing people."  Yeah downvotes used as punishments... eh, yeah back to my original point -  "The reddit hive cannot be trusted to act reasonably, especially not about emotive topics."   So in fact I had already addressed both of these in the thread.  Is there some post I am missing ?  I'm trying to meet you half way here.    Yes, why would anyone ever try to explain the personal motivations of why anyone does anything? It is impossible.  No one can truly know the intentions of another.   No, it's okay. Like I said, I'm fine with the discussion ending here.  I politely asked you to. Please, for my own sake.   Track it down and ring the number on it is best bet  I heard there is some public nuisance thing but everyone says the guards do fuck all     And yet after X number of hours it is supposed to be public nuisance under new laws?    So you refuse to acknowledge the reason other people upvote things  No I didn't, I never mentioned it.  This is not really up for argument. I didn't once mention anyones reasons for upvoting anything.  I said they routinely upvote 'junk' as you call it. I never mentioned why they did anything. It would be pointless.     I gave you one,  I'm just out of a day long boring coding class and my eyes are tired -  sorry do me one small favour and just point me to it    Because reddit is mainly 15 year olds who have never been in a relationship over 6 months    So you refuse to acknowledge the reason other people upvote things, and just dub those as "junk",   No I didn't.  Never once approached it.   and you refuse to acknowledge there might be downsides to your proposal?  There aren't.   All it does is allow everyone the equal voice of 1 upvote and no downvoted into negatives which hide the comment and if you are a newish user start the ridiculous delay process which prevents you from posting often.  Any site rule breaking content will be reported and removed by mods. If more mods are needed get them, it's not a paid position, plenty of willing people. In fact the inability to downvote certain comments in a thread could lead to them being ignored more often, as many people go to the negatives first to read the nasty comments.  There are absolutely no negatives in my idea.  If you can think of one I'd love to hear it.       Good. Disgraceful incident.    You already did. They upvote the equivalent of 'first' to the top.  There are no downsides. All it does it prevent things from being downvoted into the negatives and hidden. If they are against site rules they are reported and removed by mods. If they are fine but go against the hive they remain in view.  Nothing else to it.    Looks pretty shit. Wait for the film. But looks very stylish and light hearted     About what?  Guy did like two bank jobs and got knocked up.   Great actor.     The reddit hive cannot be trusted to act reasonably, especially not about emotive topics.  They routinely upvote junk to the top, and routinely downvote peoples opinions because they disagree with them. Some try the old 'you didn't explain yourself properly' bullshit line so they can feel superior about the fact they are one of the hive but that's about it.  That will never change.   Only solution is to remove the ability to do so.     Remove downvotes completely. I don't think it is possible though.   No downvoting into negatives to hide comments which in turn attracts the hive to automatically downvote and brings out the downvote trolls who comment or insult just to get upvotes themselves.  All opinions unless blatantly against site rules should remain.     interesting idea   This is pretty much the first shower thought that hit home.     Guy should be banned for a year    Nice to see this instead of the braindead iamsosmart justification of that festival in china.    Reddit in general. check our /r/flicks if you want some decent non intensive movie stuff   vidal fingered a guys ashole?   THOR 2   nICE?      That guy should be shamed. I'd pull the team from the competition.   cherry crabbies? never seen before   So right. These interchangeable directors, who are they? I check their IMDBs and barely recognise things until boom they got a huge film.   So I go check above. Oh yeah he did that film 20 years ago which was okay. Then some crap and tv and then he got thor.   Are the studios so confident they don't require anyone with a vision because of their involvement? Do they just get a blank slate to come in and direct their product? Because that is what it feels like.  The scripts are just well I dunno.   Jurassic World was the same. The Avengers is getting there.    	148
 Good stay away from it.  It's the first step down a mountain of shit.   Did she throw bottles at you?   I finished champloo for the first time the other day.  Just wow.   I have a boker kwaiken as well.  I love that knife.   Idk man have you gotten the Griffen armor yet? It looks pretty damn cool to me.   Alright this might be a stupid question but for the general election coming up is it possible to have 2 democrats being nominated  instead of 1 Democrat and 1 republican?   That man was probably tortured.   That's when you just drop a large GO FUCK YOURSELF and smash all the glassware on the floor.   Can someone put up a link?   Welcome brother! That's a good looking bike you got there.   I don't think that works.   Courts marshal.   Did you beat his face in?   I'm watching the show for the first time.  Holy shit, that fight was intense.   I was riding home from work with a guy who has one of those.  They just look so bad ass riding by.     Idk if there is but there should be.   These guys and senses fail were the shit back in the day.   I'm like 22 episodes in right now.  That guys creeps me the hell out.   I like the song "heroes of our time".   S5.   I connected my phone to my ps4 so all I have to do is play Spotify through my phone and it comes out on the speakers on my tv.   What music are you guys listening to while playing?  I like classical music.   Good for you!   Pop a wheely, drop his ass on the pavement and drive off.   I usually have that problem before work.  Then I just put on my hat, walk on in.   I have an fz6 and I love it.   I named my first bike, I had a 1982 cb900c I called Matilda. I haven't named my second one yet.   Ready player one! By no means is it an original story but it makes up for that with heart.   This is my second bike and I'm in love with it as well.  Well good luck to ya man, sending some good vibes your way.  Have fun out there!   Hey no way I just bought a 2004 fz6 acouple weeks ago.  How do you like yours?   My father taught me how to ride when I was 11.  First thing I did was run straight into a mailbox.   I think it looks great stock.   Algebraic!   Algebraic!   I would have done nothing. Absolutely nothing.   "Did we just become bestfriends?!" "Yep!"   I'm awfully sorry man.  I hope he pulls through!   When I watched the show again for the second time I did skip it.     It's in the middle of the season.  A man in a special helmet kills a woman in front of about a hundred people.  No one does anything to stop him.   "If you do something interesting, I'll stab you."  Uhhh okay.  	40
 I did search this reddit to find out if this had been said before but couldn't find anything, so please take my apologies if its old news.  I have personally met with all the cast members this year, autograph hunting, and have asked each one individually and they all confirmed that series 11 is set for an end of 2015 release.  Hope thats good news for all of you!      Yeah in the uk its been all over the papers about underage teens sending snapchat nudes to eachother and people taking screen shots and showing them around school. Both boys and girls have been arrested for distributing child porn. Well done government.   That's pretty cruel. Could at least big him up on the net, poor boy!   Charity begins at home, didn't your parents tell you this!   Yeah I will definitely look into it in the new year :)   I have no idea what that is to be totally honest with you, quick google and now I do know, that really does sound like a good idea, thanks for the info!  	7

 Males can squee, can't we?  Just put on a fresh pair of shorts and it's all good.  I just did.   Perfect name!  Did you know that when he was a puppy he'd live up to it?   Same here.  Watch only on the left.  Anytime I see somebody with it on the right, he's either a leftie or wrong.   Wow.  Flavored chips didn't exist in the USA until 1954?  How is that possible?  Nobody thought to add jalapenos or Old Bay to them prior to that?   Holy crap.  Walking around up there with just business shoes?  That's just plain stupid.     Pretty aircraft.  There's one hanging in the Smithsonian's National Air   Space Museum on the Mall.  I always it was an odd choice for an American museum.     I've spent limited time in Chicago but watched pretty much every ep of ER, The Good Wife, and Shameless.  Be prepared for a Chicago-condition winter but one that will last only a week.  Our summers will be tougher to acclimate to -- 95F plus humidity is life-draining.  Our springs and autumns however are world-class.  I swear during cherry blossom week, DC is this prettiest city on the planet.    Washington itself is much smaller obviously so I bet faster to get around.  The L from O'Hare to downtown amazed me how long it took.    DC's got a weird duality in that it's insular amongst social circles yet everybody welcomes a newcomer.  The city is also much more international than Chicago -- a good chunk of your class will be foreign.    You'll be fine.  Lots of midwesterners here.     Interesting idea, but the choices are too limited.     Ah.  That's a gavel on the bottom.     What's the reason for the bald eagle in the northwest?  American soldier cemetery?     I've flown from National to Bermuda.  I think they did all the customs stuff upon arrival at the airport in Bermuda -- the opposite of doing it when say flying from Dulles to Heathrow.   Roanoke, which is in the center of all this, was originally called "Big Lick."   British English spelling for an American English movie.  Unless this pic was taken in Europe.   My sense was that with the women they were young and impressionable.  They would've been maybe five to ten years older than me.    The late 70's were weird.  Even the early 80's.  All kinds of cult-y movements springing up.  I fended off all of them -- for some reason, I seemed like an easy target, but have a hidden cynicism in me.  I'm happy to hear that a woman who was that close to him landed on her feet and raised a child who writes as well as you do.  Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised!  But you have to know: Erhard was a con man.     Spare fuses.  When a storm hits, that is not the time to figure out what fuse belongs where.   I don't sadly.  Did she ever meet Erhard?  From my POV as a teenager in the 70's, I thought the adults were going insane.    But anytime I'd see an EST type on TV, the females sounded like that, while the males weren't too different from modern self-help types.   For my mini-generation, I think that's remarkable as normally it's the adults thinking the teenagers were going insane.  There was a terrific movie where a real-life EST girl coralled a director.  It's on the tip of my tongue.    Anyhow, that movement was weird.  I hear Erhard has vanished.  What did your mom do with them?     Ouch.  Classic "good enough" traffic engineering.    I imagine re-routing roads in the UK is a whole new level of problems, but still.   I've been there -- he had converted a urinal from Sloppy Joe's to become a water bowl for his cats, right?  Still there?   I drive a '68 Mustang as a daily driver.  My goodness -- Ford managed to produce a car that would be only more tail-happy!    I did not think that was possible.   "Theatres"?   No they can't.  I have never seen a pic of a llama who did not look smug.   True.  I'm really digging Rachel McAdams, so that'll see me through to the end.  But I swear to God anytime Velcoro appears, I want to take a week wacker to his 'stache.     Yup.  I thought it was cheap cop-out.  I'm not enamored of this world the way I was of season 1.     I agree and I live in the epicenter of political discussion: Washington, DC.  The problem is that those of living here effectively do not have a vote.    I think yapping about politics is a waste of time.    But I do have a buddy who truly knows what's going on at any given time, and I love hearing his reports from the trenches.     My bet it is that it was a leak.  ESPN is not TMZ.     The CFPB is toothless.   This is a nuisance settlement.    How fucking dare they consider this to be a victory?     I did once.  Had a very nice chat with a little old lady who noticed that I was reading Moby Dick while waiting for my number to be called.     Al Shepard walked on the moon.  You honestly think he didn't rip one off just to show everybody who's the boss?!   Whoa!  That was Fred Ward?!  Nice catch!  I thought I recognized him.  Anyhow I truly hate Velcoro.  When what happened to him at the end of ep 2 happened, I was all "good!"   Is this a prank reel?  How could the bird immediately vocalize what Attenborough just said?  And how does a wild bird in Australia get access to Seinfeld re-runs?     You never know with celebs who are in movement from point A to point B.  They could be out of gas and irritable.  John Goodman is supposedly a great guy but beware if you mess with him inbetween shoots.     I have to admit -- the shark fin was a clever idea.  Too bad nobody tried "swimming" with it.     That might have been an influence on the internet, but I'm 53 and knew of so-called cat ladies well before the internets.    Watch American Hustle.  They prey on a woman who had too many cats.     This is exactly correct.  If you have an over the air antenna you can the FCC-controlled broadcasters listed above, but redditor above forgot The WB, which is the home of Supernatural which I will keep watching until the bitter end.  The broadcasters also have a number of sub-channels.  For example, my ABC affiliate has a channel 7.2 that shows reruns of the best 70's and 80's shows.  My CBS affiliate has a 9.3 that shows the weather radar loops.  Meanwhile on cable/sat there's basic cable -- AMC with Breaking Bad -- and premium cable -- HBO with Game of Thrones.  I love having over the air reception.  The picture quality is better than compressed satellite quality.     Here's the video.  Doesn't seem all that bad, but who would buy donuts on the counter? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ariana-grande-donuts-video_559d11b6e4b0a9aadf39e934    Agreement that dogs are much more expressive than other animals, but cats -- or at least my cat -- has expressions.  Eyes slitted and head high and looking smug?  He's feeling smug.  Eyes wide and staring at me like he wants something?  He wants something.     I'm not sure what exactly you're referring to as Ackroyd and Martin were aping a Czech accent and the woman a manufactured accent, but for the people speaking normally and having been grown up in the 70's, I can add  - on the SNL skit, that's Larraine Newman in the middle.  She was hilarious.  The accent you hear her speaking in was the famous Mid-Atlantic American accent from the 40's Hollywood.  See My Girl Friday.  She didn't normally talk this way, but I bet thought it the best choice for an arts patron of the period.  - JZ Knight is more interesting.  The accent before she went into character is only of the 70's.  It's the way people involved in the self-enlightenment programs such as EST spoke.  You could spot them immediately.  I never encountered one in real as I was too young, and I think it was mostly a West Coast thing.     What happened to the stink bugs anyway?  The winter wasn't that brutal.  Maybe all the rain?     The guy didn't sue the blogger as a John Doe at the very least?   I just googled the bejesus out of this picture.  Despite being a wikicommons pic, it's not used in any wiki article.  The official USN description says the gunner was "thrown clear" though.     Yeah I usually take Acela when going to NYC from DC.  It's such a hellhole.  There is a Irish Pub tucked away that I really like and I normally hate Irish Pubs (unless actually in Ireland).     Mosquito repellent.  I hate the rules of this game as I also bought beer in the same purchase.   I think TMZ or somebody polls celebrities as to what the final score of the Superbowl will be.  It's inevitably won by a former Baywatch star or the like.     Nicely researched article!  This is where he got on the highway:  https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/1202/1579/4m/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/08/10/2A54921200000578-0-image-a-67_1436346996129.jpg  It strikes me as a horrible layout asking for trouble.   And you admit this?   I don't know enough about the market at the tiem.  Were Commodore 64's TI products co-branding with Timex or something?   Ah, LinkedIn.  What a resource!  You must be more professional than most mags.  I've always wondered what would happen if a magazine just created a /r/nameofmymagazine and simply posted its articles there to use reddit as a free comments section.   Unless of course you pay for subscriptions, which if you're a LinkedIn vet, you do.  Maybe a best of series of postings?    followers from Facebook are all in places that are behind the european circuit on technology.  What does that mean?   I gotta say if I was the Greek PM and had in money, this is precisely what I'd send to Brussels just to freak them out.   Have you every been able to use reddit to promote the magazine?  Otherwise what does this entail?  Lots of twitter and Facebook?   Nope, I've never had the chance to try one.  But couldn't a toddler nibble at it to get to the toy?  Anyhow, I remember growing up in the 70's there was soap with a toy inside it if you used the full bar.  My brother and I would regularly knife them in half.  Not smart to have I'd guess a 7 year old and a 5 year old around knives and wet soap bars.  We were fine but the potential for danger was there.  Now add in candy.    I'm just saying I think the US FDA has a rational argument on their side.   Why are the birds challenging the lizard?  They can fly; he can't.  Nest nearby?   What a great smile!   Oops.  I subscribe and didn't notice which sub I was in -- I thought it was historyporn.  Nevermind.  Happy cakeday!   I've never been attracted to hunting but have always loved shooting -- my best childhood friend's father was a renowned sportsman/hunter.  If I had these bastards digging up my ranch, I'd be emailing Pig Man for tips on how to get a clean shot at them.     This was post-Reagan I thought.  They'd already migrated to the GOP at that point.  Things like this happen.  In Virginia, we had George Allen running for the Senate against Jim Webb, who was regarded as having zero chance of winning and was there simply so the race wouldn't be uncontested.  Allen made a huge goof -- the macaca comment -- and suddenly everybody remembered that he was a moron.  Webb won.  Webb's also now running against Hilary Clinton.     Is that because of snow days?  I grew up in Virginia and the schools generally let out around Memorial Day.    Anyhow, OP if your parents could afford summer camp, you went.  Getting the children out of the house for a month is a grand tradition in American marriages.  I've always thought it had less to do with the children than the parents wanting some alone time.   An oldie internet thing:  https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/1b/c7/ae/1bc7aed549c633070a4bf5878988dd98.jpg  I really like the "welcome aboard -- please call me Admiral" idea.   Like Mark Twain, the reports of her death have been highly exaggerated.   My bet is a dolphin.  They're curious critters.    Odd that you saw no fin of any sort though.     I gotta say that if my child was going to get bused due to the first letter of my last name, I'd be kind of pissed, too.  Arbitrary reason to tack on an hour or two of the student's commute.   I'm actually with the US on this.  Children too young to understand that there's a toy inside could get access to one of these.  The wiki says three children in the UK did in fact die due to choking.    A 3-year is very different from say a 6-year old, obviously.       Oh the TI calculators are classics!  No this was definitely a foray into PC's.  I think even Johnny Carson was making jokes about them.     Well, this incident happened at the height of the Balkans ethnic cleansing so it was a highly loaded phrase at the time.  The point was more to embarrass the newbie Congresscritters than anything else.  It was a "gotcha" stunt.   I thought that was Bridgestone.   That sounds like something Spy Magazine used to do.  They once polled every incoming member of a House class if they opposed "ethnic cleansing in Freedonia."  Everybody of course said yes and felt good about themselves.    Freedonia exists only in a Marx Brothers movie.   The thing I remember about it is that they did this in a number of cities but knew not to mess with DC as that could be real trouble, then pretended they didn't know they were doing anything that might get people worried.   Yup.  I started watching again with the debut of the 2nd half of last season -- ep. 4.9.  It was an excellent stretch of eps.  Don't hesitate to catch up via recaps and start from there.  I feel like new life has been breathed back into the franchise.     I know a guy from the Clinton Administration who somehow got possession of that helmet and still has it.     Texas Instruments did the same thing once, I believe.  They wound up basically giving away the older models, or maybe selling them for $10 in order to get shelf space free for the new models.  I don't think they stayed in the PC business much longer.   Whoa.  I thought you meant the airborne deadly disease -- I live in DC and had to deal with the anthrax attacks after 9/11.  Scarey times.  People were microwaving their mail.   Then I saw MTV.   Gold Star I think it is?  Their cashews are even better.  Buy only at half price though.   I saw the tail end of it.  He filled the dead air by paying tributes to his construction workers, who looked like they wanted to kill him.     I saw clips of his concert.  He was having a blast.    Good for him!   That was the Ann Richards race, right?  There was another incident where he refused to shake her hand.  Yes, children, there once was a time where Texas elected a progressive Democrat.     I was living in DC at the time.  I remember they had stills of some of these kids on the sides of buses.  Apparenlty, a pair of DoJ prosecutors were standing on a corner as a bus went by, and they looked at each other and immediately said "is that child porn?"  Thus the investigation was born.    Anyhow they were really creepy.  CK I guess wanted to be oh so edgy and blew it.  Same with A F these days.   Aw, I love the CVS house brand of almonds.  Try them!   You could also try r/archiveporn.  I don't know they accept albums though.   Those letters belong in a Civil War museum.  I like how somebody along the line put them in a protective liner.     I've never been certain about whether the markings were black   white like zebra stripes or multi-colored.  Anybody know?   I gave up on after the Governor horsepoop, but came back to it this past season with Alexandria and whatnot.  I'm glad I did.    Wikipedia has surprisingly good recaps, so I was able to fill in the blanks.  I don't think I missed much.     FP is off the leash and free associating without fear tonight.  Nancy Drew?   r/thingsjonsnowknows    I know Gene refers to Gene Okerlund, but that's about it.   Why not both?  Bryce could be a girl name too.  Bryce Maxine perhaps?   No sadly.  I don't envy anybody having to search manually.      /r/HeyCarl for anybody needing more.   This is second only to seeing a teddy bear thrown away.   Couldnt get it show even on 820p   The just found by overwhelming evidence that Cosby had launched himself into the public sphere.  Ordinary firing litigations don't have that kind of behavior so they're left sealed.   Snooty Gwyneth Paltrow and the first lady of reddit Jennifer Lawrence.  Actually now that I think about it, despite what a trainwreck it'd be, it could be fun.   I somehow got roped into seeing a concert I didn't want to go to, and there was this cute blonde who also yodelled opening.  Jewel.  Two months later, I Was Meant For You broke nationally and I couldn't have been happier for her.  I love her to this day.   That is a seriously well-tailored suit.  High waistband by today's standards, but it that's the only thing 70's-ish about it, the man's got classic style!   Don't panic but it's your cakeday.   **Submission Statement:**  An examination into Frontline's examination of international gambling.  It's fascinating in that I can't tell if they as Frontline says couldn't get their sources squared away or if as Bergman says they were afraid of litigation costs.        I was preparing to buy my first CD player in maybe '86 or so.  I asked my salesman what would be the best demonstration CD to test the various players.  So my very first CD purchase was Frankie Goes to Hollywood.     We've got B-52's are now being piloted by grandchildren of their first pilots.  Or so I read.  Still, they've been in service for decades, too.   You never know.  Maybe she had a bad first marriage and wants security with her second?  He's by all accounts a charming guy, so all the best to the happy couple from me.   Pretty much my favorite Bond girl.  That cute little wave she gave 007 from the helicopter?  Swooon.   I live in DC's Georgetown.  Every single intersection not controlled by a traffic light is a four-way stop.    It works pretty well as most drivers know what they're doing and newer drivers catch on by doing the same, but I have noticed that when I'm close to Georgetown University, things break down.  I think it's all the adult drivers from out of town taking their children to visit the campus.     I've gone on Saturdays the past few times I've had to get inspected and sailed through each time.  Maybe one or two cars ahead of me.    My inspection date is always late October though.  Maybe that has something to do with it?   DAE think the narration is modern and tacked on?     I bet he's going to trounce Fallon.  Beer pong with Channing Tatum is interesting exactly once.     Crappy quiz.  There was no 1978 Winter Olympics.      "For Whom the Bell Tolls"  I regard it as one of the greatest novels ever written.    Read up on the Spanish Civil War before launching into it.    Hemingway's short stories are perhaps the best introduction to him though.  A Warm Well-Lit Place is a classic.   Yeah that's kind of my thinking, too.  Question is: who replaces him?      True dat.  I walked out my door at 3pm and walked back in at 1am.    I guess we were the only trains on the tracks.  Still: 20 minutes including a transfer at L'Enfant.     Never apologize for being an insufferable know-it-all -- you are on reddit.   What could possibly be going on inside these cats' heads?  edit word.   Relax.  This is as bad as it gets.  I've never seen anything worse.  Normally it's drunk people doing drunken things.   For example, here is a man lighting fireworks off of his privates.  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=ac6_1408136793  He's fine, so safe for looking.    I think it's the absolute best HMB vid on the internets.    By that rubric, no female sports are worth watching.  I love womens' tennis.  I could watch say a Sharapova vs. either Williams sister final and never get bored.     Before I click off this thread, I just wanted to say many thanks OP for the play by play!  Nicely done!   What a great video!  I love how they included the girls' high school team goal.    Edit: which goal won the award?   Oh I gotcha.  The RCMP I'm sure have Interpol on speed dial.   I was at the 18 inning marathon last October and it took me maybe 20 minutes to get from Navy Yard to Foggy Bottom.  Metro was awesome that night.  I got the sense our trains got special treatment.    Glad you got to go the game!   I know -- he seems to feed off of the energy.     I loved his star spangled bat yesterday.  Apparently he'd had it in the locker room for a year and was waiting to use it.     There's a Harper brand broom?  Are they for sale within the DC area?  edit:  http://www.harperbrush.com/   I know.  It felt like an away game.   Whoa.  How did you get home that fast?!   OP you should x-post this into r/soccer!   He said the thing nobody could know about is how great the weather was that day and the different colors of flames coming from the Japanese carriers.    It must have been epic!   I just did a drive-by on it.  There are people defending Bruce so they're not all bad.   I didn't think Uncle Ray was awful.  I like him.  But FP's "special."   I can watch a replay of Bryce's splash into McCovey Cove and never get tired.   Me, too.  I thought it was a signal to the dugout.   I love Bryce losing his helmet like that.   I think it was huge.  Horrible stadium.     I once met a man who was a Wildcat pilot at Midway.     I just tuned in post-WC euphoria and OMG these guys are annoying.  They don't seem to have much audio from the field, either.   I still think this is most frightening thing anybody could have in their homes.   No chance.  The USA and Canada will be in a diplomatic stand-off by dawn.     I wish he was.  I'd love to hear his reception.   I know -- I saw her in the semis celebrations and wondered what her story is.   Where's Sepp?   I totally disagree.   Nah.  Her kind of crazy runs too deep.   Somewhere Brandi Chastain is ripping off her jersey!   Nice way to bookend her career!   Wait until you start seeing guys your age retiring.  NFL then NBA then MLB.    53 here.     I wonder if we'll see 250.   If anybody deserves a curtain call, it's her!   I think that's the very first time I've ever seen Sawa get angry.   Including the own goal.     There we go.  Thank Alexandra Patricia Morgan!  Meanwhile, the guy in the eagle mask never gets old.   Player of the match?  The architect of the stadium.     It's almost NSFL:  http://www.milb.com/assets/images/6/6/2/128128662/cuts/Buffarine_bxms7dn4_iun7cwsm.jpg   Live and Let Die is actually my favorite Bond film.  It's the one where he escapes from the little island surrounded by alligators, right?   I'm from SW Virginia.  There's a Pulaski county.  It's really pretty.   I lived in London for awhile.  I really miss kebabs.   Crappy free kick.   HOLY CRAP!!!   I just tuned in and was what the game started an hour ago?  Shades of Germany/Brazil!   For some reason, the threads in r/soccer are better attended:  https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/3c8nde/match_thread_usa_vs_japan_wwc_final/?sort=new   Fun fact: there is always an officer of the Royal Navy stationed on the USS Churchill.   You can smell all the horse poop dust.  I wonder why those buildings that were at the location of the Reagan Building got torn down.  The site used to be a huge parking lot.  They look to be perfectly good, large buildings.     Ageist.   The 395 option is I think the most epic, but there's a sublime alternative especially as you're coming from the north.  Take the Connecticut Avenue exit off of the Beltway and drive south until you hit the White House.    You'll see the city spool out as you drive down it.  If you have interest, reply and I'll add some pointers that you'll need.   As a former little human who invited such tackles with an ornery English Bulldog, that feeling is AMAZING!!!  Bulldog vs. 6 year old me?  He won most gladditor conflicts.   Where is this?  New A/C in Europe during the heatwave?   The authorities said it was one of those things best left unsolved.    Dammit Reagan had a great tailor but oh his choice in ties was deplorable.    Still what fun for everybody in this picture.     I can't believe she went all in on the grinding.   noscript got really worried with his video.  I wonder if the ChiCom internet people messed with it.    *:: epic season-long Supernatural montage ::*   I heard what sounded to be cannons but it sounded closer than Arlington Cemetery.     I think everybody in the US has a high opinion of Canada.     I went to college in Vermont and have many happy memories of Montreal.  I never understood the hatred to the French Canadians.   It was a very odd incident.  I drive past the spot a couple times a year where he shot himself and get the heebie-jeebies -- it's not a natural place to commit suicide.      I'm a Virginian who went to college in Vermont.  I love that state.    I didn't have a problem with the winters.  Challenging but not overwhelming.  Plus I love to ski.  We'd go to class in the morning, ski in the afternoon, study in the early evening, and party later on.  Rinse   repeat.  It was heaven.     Typing to you from Georgetown.  I love living in DC.    You're wrong about the city going hollow after sunset.  Incredibly wrong.  K Street of course gets emptied out, but there's a LOT going on elsewhere.     I live in DC and see tons of French flags on Bastille Day.     Aw I hate people crapping on hotmail.  That's my email address since perhaps 2000 and I still love it.  It's much better now, too.     Huh.  It looks like they launched from the Ellipse back then.  Now they launch from the sides of the Reflecting Pool.    Anyhow I saw the Mall fireworks earlier tonight in person.  Awesome as always.     That is SO cool!  I regard him as having planted the seed of the US re-embracing soccer.     Honeymoon here in freaking AUGUST!!!?  This is when DC turns back into a swamp.    I guess if you can survive that, your marriage is on solid ground.     That was really annoying.  The sound of the chopper detracted from the sound of the explosions.     Chuck Berry I hear will only accept payment in cash in a brown paper bag even to this day.  He doesn't get the bag?  No show.   It's a horribly written question.  All those modifiers in the middle?  Blech.   They're not feral anymore!   Well, I don't think he's as fat as Taft.  That guy needed a special bathtub to be installed in the WH.    Anyhow, I think his weight is the least of his problems.  I don't think he'll make it past New Hampshire, but who knows.   A red SOLO cup.  Accept no substitutes.   Actually when I saw that pic I thought he'd lost a lot of weight.     I have an orange tabby tomcat.  He's a terrific mouser.  The problem is that he'll catch them outside, then bring them inside to keep catching them.    I've never seen him with a dead one.   I appreciate that.  He was absolutely destroyed.  Washington basically made him go to France as ambassador to get him out of Monticello, where he'd effectively become a recluse.  If you get a chance to read Jefferson's Conversation Between the Heart and the Head from that period, take it.  It's wrenching.   This is a common misconception.  His wife died in childbirth well before the Sally Hemmings affair allegedly happened.   Do you want tinnitus?  Because this is how you get tinnitus.   My heart broke watching her interview.

 I'm playing it again right now and am conflicted which I should do first. Would it help me more to do the Shadow first to complete the Spirit or vice versa? I did Forest-Fire-Water, got Boggoron's Sword and fire arrows.    I can't. I've tried. Website doesn't work I've been trying for a few weeks now at least once a day. I'm not interesting in reading about people talking shit and saying things they wouldn't say in person. It just doesn't do anything for me. And if I want porn i just go to xnxx.com or /r/riskyclicks, or some other porn subreddit. But I don't have a need to talk shit about fat people, LGBT, or anything else. It just isn't something that I care to do even though I know I'm anonymous.    I do smoke pot for my Crohn's. High in CBD is best.   I don't care what the entire thread was about you commented on free speech being denied because reddit banned some fucking subreddit that hates on fat people (so fucking what...get over it)- it's not. It's like you haven't even read the 1st amendment.    No, I hardly eat- I have Crohn's Disease incredibly hard to gain weight with all the blood and shit that comes out of my ass. Reddit banning a subreddit shaming fat people does not deny you free speech.   Free speech only means congress will not make a law denying you the ability to say what you want. Free speech doesn't mean Reddit, a website, can't ban a subreddit if it wants to- if the guy who made it or whoever runs it wants to do it- they can. It's not much different than a mod banning someone for saying shit either.   The only guarantee you have with free speech (with the exception of libel) is that you won't be prosecuted for what you say- it doesn't mean you won't get fired from a job, have a website ban you...etc       No sorry it's my fault I meant to reply to /u/AllRubyx   ? What law did congress make that denied you free speech?    You're allowed to do whatever you want. I'm just curious why it would be better than reddit.    I thought it was the best part of the movie.    Your free speech isn't lost. Free speech only means the government won't make a law limiting what you say (with the exception of libel, or words that present clear danger). So...you can still say whatever you want- but that doesn't mean it won't get you banned on a website for it.   Why should I care if Reddit bans a subreddit about hating fat people? My freedom isn't being taken away. That doesn't bother me. Good for them. This is there website- they made it- they can do whatever they fuck they want with it.   If you don't like that- why don't you just make your own the way you want it? That seems like a good solution. You can find ANYTHING on the internet. My freedom of speech isn't being limited. It never have. Just because this person disagrees with you doesn't make them ignorant nor myself and it doesn't make me shortsighted.   You are foreseeing a trickle down where "banning subreddits against fat people...well shit...next i won't be allowed to 'fag' or 'fuck' on this website and anywhere on the internet...my life is doomed!!"   I think you're overreacting a bit and foreseeing a future that will not happen.    why would it be better than reddit?    doesn't work.    And Spock. Spock vaporizes Rock.

Side note: Does Song of Storms sound like Game of Thrones theme?   So, I am in the forest temple, I got the two keys in the beginning, killed the Stalfos for the map.

AHHHHH    Harry.....*tugs at shirt*....H-H-H-Haar rrryyy!!   "WHAT RON!?!?!?!"    I bet so. I just thought Wilder was terrible.    Interesting considering Dahl disliked Wilder's version considerably. So much so he refused to sign over rights for the sequel.    Hm I thought his acting was great.    Interesting. I read it as, "The thing that put me off ... I like Johnny Depp, I like him, as an actor I like him very much ... but when I saw little pieces in the promotion of what he was doing, I said I don't want to see the film, because I don't want to be disappointed in him"   yeah i liked alice in wonderland.    I liked Depp's version better lol.    downvotes   Nah. Don't agree at all.    Well this match wasn't particularly as close as 6-4, 6-4. A lot of tennis players have the skill to beat Serena- but they don't. It's not just beating her- it's consistently beating her. I don't think anyone but Venus can say that.    I don't disagree Graf had amazing skills, but not any better than Serena's skill. Yes she won 22 slams before she turned 30, but did she win any when she was over 30? No. I think that's impressive when you consider at what age most women retire in tennis. It's even more impressive when you consider her dominance at her age. It's not like she just won one or two close ones after she turned 30, she pretty much revamped her career.    Yeah you are. There wasn't anyone like Serena in the past. She is unique.    Yeah, Court has 24 grand slams, but pro's weren't allowed to play in grand slams for a time- so i don't think you can consider hers as the number to reach. 22 is the number.    Strings? She's in the conversation of being the greatest collection of loops we've ever abstractly looped.    ESPN isn't exactly the greatest place for good sports news.

That's why the officer's arrived at the scene, his wife was too drunk to be left alone so they took her until she sobered up and could care for herself. I live in SWFL and all they did was put him in the drunk tank until he was sober which is just 8 hours. He wasn't charged. They took him for disorderly intoxication- that's pretty normal down here in SWFL since we get so many tourists. There's nothing wrong with that. Had they not pulled the fire alarm for no reason the cops wouldn't have came at all. By the way, you can get in trouble for pulling a false alarm too.

I had this ex girlfriend who had OCD of her feet being touched. Whenever someone touched it, she had the touch the other foot exactly the same then clean them off as they were 'dirty'. For example, if you splashed on foot with water she had to splash the other. So my friend (a drummer) made a beat and I wrote some weird lyrics and we made a weird music video for it.

 It bothers me that it doesn't bother me more.   I'll be sure to remember that the next time someone tells me I should raped by a pack of niggers.  Here's a little more light reading.  http://gawker.com/5582644/all-the-terrible-things-mel-gibson-has-said-on-the-record   It means nothing that a celebrated actor is racist, homophobic, anti-semtic and violent?   He pled no contest to misdemeanour battery. So there's at least one person he hurt.  Polanski is scumbag and deserves prison.  Broderick was in a car accident 30 years ago. The family of the victim forgave him. Hardly the same thing.  I agree that Gibson was great to watch but he has ruined his own career. It is no one's fault but him.     /s ?     Repeating the things that actually happened and are on the official court records?   Events that there are audio recordings of?   The Gibson freely admits happened?    Pictures of well dressed tall/fat/skinny/short/hunchback/neckless guys and why they look good.     Portal   They forgave the first half-dozen fuck ups. But even Hollywod has limits.      Mel Gibson has show extraordinary hate and vitriol towards everyone from African-Americans to the gay community. He threatened his wife and pled no contest to a  battery charge. He's an alcoholic, self-destructive, megalomaniac shit of a man.   But sure, blame the Jews.     In smaller communities, the scammers need to go undetected and run scams in which the victim is unaware they have been taken for a ride.  One of the criteria that con artists seek out is situations in which their victims are compelled to trust them. For example, older people are scammed more often than younger people not because they are gullible but, as you age and become more separated from your community, you need to trust others more.  A canny con man could very easily take advantage of the levels of trust that are necessarily built up in small communities.   For example, if there is only one butcher in town, you're less likely to question the quality and source of his meat.

I wrote an article a few years for a magazine about the Spanish prisoner and how it has evolved as technology has evolved.   The earliest versions of the scam, which dates back 500 years, was much the same as today. The con man needs to rescue a spanish prisoner held prisoner with her vast fortune in a foreign land. If you'll pay for the rescue mission, the money and the girl are yours.

They're fantastic films but none are ground breaking.      All great films! But none of those films are ground-breaking or exciting though.  Sixth sense is a classic premise done really well, Toy Story 2 is sequel and green mile is shawshank redemption with magic.   Good solid films in a dull year.    1999.  We had Fight Club, American Beauty and The Matrix but, while fantastic, none of those films are particularly ground breaking.   The year was also packed full of films by filmmakers who had done better. Phantom Menace, Eyes Wide Shut, The Spy Who Shagged Me, Tarzan, The World Is Not Enough, Notting Hill....  1999 was a year for playing it safe, limping to end of the lackluster nineties.

 You've clearly never played in any of my games.   That's because a lot of them don't have exact matches. For example, the one hero fig is Gorman di Wolfe, but with what looks like a reclaimer head.   There's at least a min unit of Mind Bender and Drudges there, though, and two Freebooters. That's a pretty nice bonus of tourney legal models, if you ask me. That's not even counting how many more you could use with minor conversions.   I haven't really looked into this new version, but I played the True20 version a long time ago.   It's good, in a general sense. It has a very specific feel to it. The setting feels more like a setting from a novel than from a game, and even when playing it feels more like you are taking part in a novel. It's a bit... romantic? I'm not even sure what word to use. I distinctly remember it being a setting that seemed to cater to people less interested in primarily male power fantasies. The characters in the setting were all very dramatic and rich with involved emotional motivations. Combat was always sort of a secondary or even tertiary thing.  Keep in mind, some of my experience is probably affected by the GM I had at the time, and it's entirely possible that other people feel differently about it.    Well, I'm specifically talking about using them as the exact model they were taken from. For instance, I have a min unit of Farrow Brigands that are now a full unit, and there is a Targ and some Razor Boars in there too. I was thinking about proxying them anyway for casual games, but now they're tournament legal.   Makes me even more excited about [this](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/board-games/the-undercity).   You are talking about [The Strange](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/129405/The-Strange-corebook). That's literally the premise of the setting.  Not only does it do this, it's also my favorite system for running games. It's light, but not so light as to be annoying (like Fate).   Oh god.... what have they done?   Wow, something interesting talked about on that thread:   Unleashed Adventure Kit models are now tournament legal straight out of the box.   My Rhulic army is going to have a lot more women in it now.   I like and do both. I run Fate and Numenera and spent years running Risus based games. I also *love* Iron Kingdoms RPG (extremely rules-heavy, in case you didn't know), and I'm a big fan of Rogue Trader.  It's all in what you want to do. Some people like one more than the other, but there's no wrong way to have fun. Just let people do what they like, and you do what you like, and it's all good.   There is [this](http://www.gaspgamer.com/), which is probably a decent start.   It's hard to give you more without knowing where you are in relation to Pittsburgh (I'm North of Pittsburgh, mostly).   You can PM me if you like.   I have a simple trick that lets me roleplay women perfectly:   Portray them exactly how you would if they were a man, except any time they would use their dick, use a vagina instead.  If you want them to know it's a woman character, tell them it's a woman character.   Saw "Cleric - Vet" in the TLDR, and read the main text to find out if it was Veteran or Veterinarian, and it's both. Well done, sir.   You don't have to sell me, I've already bought in.   To sell the system, the best way is to promote how easy it is to run (since you want to play, not run it yourself). For me, it's the best thing for GMs since the invention of dice. The fact that I can work up stats for an NPC faster than you can look them up in other systems is amazing. And it's not just a flat difficulty like a few people have complained about on here. It's a *base* difficulty, adjusted up or down based on what they'd be good or bad at. The level is just the rough starting point, and it's something that no other system has.  For the setting, I actually try to avoid the Adventure Time/Samurai Jack/etc feel if I can. Get them to read some Clark Ashton Smith or Jack Vance or even Frank Herbert. To be honest, though, I never really use the stock setting from the book. I have so many of my own weird far future settings I can use that I don't need the one from the book.   I'm a fan of Numenera, but I more often use The Strange, and I'm dying to get the new Cypher System book coming out in August.   Amazon is funny like that. There was a dice set I saw the other day that was a pair of underwear.   Honestly, someone's got to give. I play in a lot of games, and if some people want a silly game, it's a silly game. It doesn't matter how much the serious players want it to be a serious game, it's just not going to be if everyone is not on board.  My recommendation? Tell them ahead of time that it's going to be one way or the other, and run two different games.   Alright, I'll bite, but I'm not doing 3.5/PF. I rolled randomly to see what picture to do, and I got #4, the Witch's Son by Lauren Nichols. I'm doing stats for The Strange, level 1.  Eudet's childhood was pretty typical for an outcast. Picked on at school for everything from his name to his mother's religion; no interest in sports; always talking about "weird" things, like magic and other worlds. The truth is, he was pretty sure he was crazy. The other worlds he described so vividly weren't in his imagination. If only he was creative enough for that; he could just be a writer or something, and live a boring life. Unfortunately he's a terrible writer, and none of it is fictional. When he was eight years old, he was walking in the woods behind his house, and ended up somewhere else. It was a world were magic was real, and it was everything he could have hoped for. He would have just thought it was a daydream, except that a cat took notice of him while he was there, and followed him home. A *talking* cat. Now, magic doesn't actually work in the world he comes from, but there are "cracks" in reality that he has learned to exploit. A very smart, and perceptive young man, he has a lot of potential that several organizations, like the Estate, the Circle of Liberty, and even the OSR have taken special interest in. Only time will tell what he does with his talent.  Eudet Clemens, a Sharp Eyed Paradox who Solves Mysteries.  Might 8, Speed 10, Intellect 16(1).  Skills: Knowledge (Witchcraft) (T), The Strange (T), Perception actions (S).  Abilities: Practiced With Light Weapons, Premonition (2 Intellect points), Shatter (2 Intellect points), Find the Flaw, Investigator, Sleuth.   I ran this kind of game using The Strange and it worked really well. I actually left magic out (I was going more for Cyberpunk2020 than Shadowrun), but it has it in there by default.   The Strange uses the Cypher system, which is a nice middle ground between heavy and light rules. The only real changes you need to make from the base setting is disallow Translating (the base game's premise is about moving between other dimensions, and it's called Translating). It's otherwise already set up for this kind of setting. Just pick out which Foci you think are appropriate for the players to have, and let them build their characters as normal.  The main book is a bit on the pricey side, but you can check out the [pdf of the player's guide](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/129406/The-Strange-Players-Guide?src=also_purchased) for super cheap to see if it looks like something you'd like first.   They have free quickstart rules that you can check out [here](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf) and [here](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery).  It's a rules-heavy game with fast, deadly combats. It shares a lot in common with D D in the sense that there are fighters and wizards, dwarves and elves, as it was originally a campaign setting for D D, but it puts its own spin on it. It has since become a wargame, and now it is its own rpg. It can still basically be described as Steampunk D D, but it's hard to explain without knowing what games you are already familiar with.   It has some of the player-driven-narrative strength of Fate without sacrificing structure. It has the some of the best rules intensive combat without getting slow or boring. It uses 2d6 instead of d20 making each point of bonus important while still having luck have some effect on success.   I think the only real drawback I can think of is that the rules are very much married to the setting (I'd kill for a scifi game using the same rules). It's one of my favorite published settings though, so it doesn't bother me too much.   For me, IKRPG was the D D4e I was hoping for. It does everything that 4e did that was any good (like fixing the power curve of fighters/spellcasters), and fixed the problems of 3.5 that 4e didn't (like long tedious combats). It also fixed a problem I didn't know was a problem, which was getting rid of the grid. Playing without a grid is so much better for me than playing with one. Without one, movement gets to be so much more fluid, and people tend to be more creative in how their character interacts with the terrain. It also has a bit of bounded accuracy and every bonus you get really matters. It deals with the swinginess of the d20 by using 2d6 instead. IKRPG *is* like a wargame, in the best ways possible. It's my go-to game for crunchy games.  I do like D D5e, too. It's really what D D should be, in my opinion. I don't really play it much though.   Rogue Trader is probably the shittiest game I love. It's so damn clunky, and restrictive, and archaic, and yet, that's kind of how it needs to be to feel right.   (you've opened a can of worms here, mate)  D Dmutherfuckin4e. Saying it's like a wargame makes me want to vomit. You've never played a wargame if you think 4e is like a wargame. It's not like a boardgame either. I'm not that passionate about boardgaming, but playing 4e is exactly the opposite of what it's like to play a board game. Board games are quick, and fun, and actually make it easy to form a story out of (even my Monopoly games have more support for narrative). I'm not saying this as a snobby outsider either. I bought the books (and subscribed to their online service), and ran 3 different year long campaigns using those rules. By the end I was ready to burn the books and shit on their grave. As fed up with 3.5 as I am, and as tired as I am of homebrewing it to hell and back trying to make it better, it's nothing compared 4e. Cut off the head, and burn the body. May God have mercy on its soul.   Look for tutorials on painting minis to look like a ghost.   But Guarder22 is right. It's basically just base coating it blue and highlighting it.   Favorite crunchy game to play: Iron Kingdoms RPG  Favorite narrative game to play: Fate  Favorite to run: Numenera/The Strange  Others at the top of my list: Eclipse Phase, Rogue Trader, Paranoia, D D5e, StarWars EotE, Stars Without Number, Deadlands   Are you wanting to use another game, but with Numenera's resolution mechanic? Are you wanting to make your own game? What parts of the Cypher system don't you want to use?   I've used the Cypher systems resolution mechanic in other games (D D4e/5e, Rogue Trader, Stars Without Number, Paranoia, IKRPG, FATE). I've also used it on it's own as a lighter version of the Cypher system.  It's hard to give you advice without knowing what you are trying to do with it.   I'm not really talking about any one style. I'm talking about communicating the style of game you are running to your players.   I run games all the time that are brutal and deadly, just like I run games where death isn't even an issue. The point I'm trying to make is to make sure your players know beforehand which it is.   Yeah, but if you are playing a roguelike, you aren't going to be surprised by that. You knew that was a thing before you started.    It's mostly just about communication with my players.   Here's an example:  I had a noblewoman who was secretly a dragon in disguise. One of the players thought he'd try his hand at getting information from her, and I warned him that she was a very powerful and dangerous person, whose enemies have a tendency to just "disappear", and she's likely to see through any kind of attempt at manipulation. He ignored the warning, made a terrible attempt at subtlety (neither he, nor his character was any good at it), and then, tried to get her to sleep with him. I warned him, the other players warned him, and he still made the decision to go with her to her room. He died.  Even though he didn't know she was a dragon (until it was too late), I still gave him plenty of warning that what he was doing was ridiculously dangerous, and would likely result in his death.  Now, if I want to surprise my players, and keep things from them, I always give them an out. If they have no inkling that something is going to be dangerous, death is off the table, and I design the encounter that way.   Imagine playing a video game, that doesn't have the option to save, and you've been carefully playing your character for countless hours, and all of a sudden, you walk into a place that gives every indication of being safe, but because of something hidden, you die. You'd probably feel cheated, all that work, and the game designer sucker punched you, making you either start over, or give up entirely. It sucks, and it's pretty much never a good idea.   It's my policy that players never die unless they made a choice knowing that death was a possibility.    Depends on the player.   Some players, don't care about the death of their character, because they aren't invested in the story, and can make another character of equal power and be back obliterating stuff in no time. I make sure that these people have to take a penalty, like lower level than the rest of the group, so that death means something to them.  Then there's people who losing a character is either devastating or nothing, because they have been been building a story with that character, and it's either his time, or not. If it's not their time yet, I offer them maiming (I offer this to the other kind of player, but they never take it), giving them some sort of lasting injury instead (like losing an arm or something). If it is their time, I just let them make their death be as awesome as they want. I then have them make a lower level character, which they don't mind, just so the other people don't complain.  You have to have death mean something, or else their characters are never really taking risks, and then nothing they do is heroic.    The d20 version of BESM might fit what you are looking for, but it's out of print. I think the srd was available for free though.   I've been working on getting ready to do this with [Deadzone](http://www.manticgames.com/mantic-shop/deadzone/getting-started-with-deadzone/product/deadzone-the-sci-fi-skirmish-game.html). It's really on the edge between boardgame and wargame though.  They also have a [Mars Attacks](http://www.manticgames.com/mantic-shop/mars-attacks/getting-started-with-mars-attacks/product/mars-attacks-the-miniatures-game.html) game, that uses a simplified version of the same rules.   Yeah, IKRPG version of balance is make *everything* unbalanced. IKRPG is purposely a deadly game.   However, it's pretty easy to give players a break by making sure they are saturated in Feat Points. Walk It Off is pretty much ridiculously good, and more than makes up for the fact that there isn't true "healers" in the game if you let it.   Also, something I do with players who don't really know how to use tactics, is have put them against really crappy enemies that use really good tactics. Let them see how hard someone is to hit when they stay behind cover, or see how devastating higher ground can be. Once they start using those tactics themselves, you can move to tougher enemies that use crappy tactics, and finally to tough enemies that use great tactics.   This might help: what "pen and paper games" have you played before?  If you played D D4e and considered the minis an "optional help" it means something a lot different than if you were playing Apocalypse World and saying the same thing.  Because to me, it sounds like you are describing 90% of mainstream roleplaying games.    I like this idea.   I vote Iron Kingdoms.  In addition, there are 3,000 non-redditors living with me that also vote Iron Kingdoms.   Except Joe, Bev, and Frank. They voted for Fate, Eclipse Phase, and "The Cypher System" (whatever that means) respectively. Weirdos.   I swear the algorithm is something like "display all results, *except relevant results*"   How many votes do I get? Can I vote for a system, or do I have to vote for a specific version/edition of that system? Are the votes weighted? If I vote for one, can I change my vote later? If so, what is the deadline? Can I submit a vote for non-redditors in my household? If so, do their votes count for the same amount as mine? What validation systems are you using to verify the results? Are times zones going to be an issue?    TIL: Reaper Kickstarters are the Steam sales of miniatures.   Oh man, to be 15 again and to believe that there is such a thing as an original idea.  *You two are just too cute for words.*   I have done this, and it was amazing.   One caveat: the players have to actually trust you. It won't work otherwise.   Iron Kingdoms is a great pseudo-classless leveling system that also has legal pdfs. [Here](http://wargamerontour.blogspot.com/2012/09/ikrpg-character-construction-102-xp-and.html) is an article all about it (with a nice sneak preview picture).   edit: forgot the link   And even then, it's probably a cheaper buy-in to just buy the minis.  	41

 10 Videos That Will Cure Cancer In The Sub. Will It Stop Redditors From Posting Low Quality Material? You'll Never Believe The Answer!   It wouldn't be funny at all. A tight weave on a basket (required to make that symbol using just the weaving) would be a sign of great craftsmanship. It would mean either you are very good at weaving yourself, or you were able to get others to do it for you.   To be fair, the articles in Playboy can be very interesting.    The seemingly never-ending streams of penis pudding emanating from his piss pipe soon had me coated like a plasterer's radio. When he removed his disco stick from my puckered brown eye, he was pleasantly surprised to see a footlong fudge bullet staring back as him. He knew I couldn't wait to gobble the stink pickle off his bugger king. The mixture of corn-eyed butt snake and penis pudding in my turd-herder created the delicious rectoplasm that he was so fond of. He rolled a giant toilet twinkie on my breasticles just so he could consume it up like a hungry hungry hippo. With his greasy slimelight fucking deep into my quim, the sensation of his greasy slimelight smashing my cervix made me quake like a tasered slab of chopped liver.  This generator is beyond awesome.   If you want a good conflict for a BDSM story, how about having some scenes where he realizes that he is going too far.  It might change the tone of your work, but it would be a relatable conflict for the readers, who (let's face it) probably don't understand BDSM.   Except for the cards themselves.  They just didn't do anything to prevent two people from using the same codes.   My personal theory is that the symbol was so common because it naturally forms as a result of basketweaving.   If this was a dad joke, then it should be bad joke eel.   Provide evidence directly from the source materials, please. Because no one else is seeing it.   Okay... let me educate you.  A good theory would be something along the lines of "Willy Wonka puts acid in his chocolate" that uses evidence like the trippy, weird interactions that the people encounter in the factory (which they don't normally feel because the effects are lessened greatly after the chocolate is cooked, formed, and shipped). Or maybe that Oz is another dimension of Earth, and that explains why the Wizard looks exactly like the kindly carney that Dorothy met before going there.  This is just... "hey, they both walk on something red"   Where is the evidence?  There is zero evidence outside of the story that you made up.  Beyond the timeframe and setting of the "real world" (Depression Era America), and the idea of little people who make candy, there is nothing to indicate the Wonka stepped foot in Oz.  More damning to your theory is the idea that the Red Brick Road, seen in Oz, somehow leads past the Deadly Desert to a place in America... because the Chocolate Factory is clearly not in Oz, due to the large number of people that gathered for the Golden Ticket event.  But there is no evidence that Wonka's father was the Wizard of Oz, nor that the Wonkavator was an Oz construct of any kind.    Banning an app from the app store is like deciding not to sell a book at Barnes and Noble.  You are still free to sell on Amazon.

He means the "catcher"   Power refers to being in control.  Bottom refers to being the catcher in a pitcher/catcher relationship.

She watched Pirates of the Caribbean one too many times    You tell them that you were a victim of a scam, that you were convinced to compromising yourself on video and were being blackmailed for increasing amounts of money.  You contacted them originally via Skype, so you have some of their Skype information. You have the phone number they used to contact you, even if it was falsified. You have the information they used to contact you by email and send them the money.  You won't ever see that money again, I'm sorry. But every piece of information the authorities receive, the more likely they will be able to catch them.   I'm assuming, because even with it being anonymous, Omegle can find his IP and get it to authorities.   The police can't do anything. No jurisdiction.  This matter goes to the FBI, where there have an ongoing task force with Interpol.   I'm wondering whether Stranger was trolling, too...

If you hang around with weaker, less fit people, you are more likely to encounter weaker genetics (people who are genetically predisposed to health problems and obesity, for example). If you hang around at the gym more, you are more likely to encounter healthier genetics (people with higher metabolisms and less propensity to health issues), resulting in stronger offspring.  If you raise your children to have the same habits, they will similarly meet stronger, healthier individuals on average, further strengthening your line. In that way, even if you hit the genetic short straw (and marry a woman who used to be 500 pounds and worked her ass off to fit into a size 3 dress), your children are more likely to make a healthy genetic match.   Not 100%, but it doesn't look good.   I've had people offer, but I never take it. Why? Because they are paying to be there, and sleeping with them makes me a whore.

Most of the time, they don't project themselves with a wholesome, family image. Tom Cruise doesn't play a loving and successful husband and father who takes time for his children and never so much as goes away on a business trip for the weekend. Samuel L Jackson doesn't portray himself as a kindly man who doesn't cuss and would rather give you a stern talking to instead of a spanking.  If this was Eddie Murphy that was accused, we probably wouldn't bat an eye about watching Beverly Hills Cop.  But if Dave Collier were to have this level of accusations, maybe they'd stop showing Full House for a while.   He said in the deposition that it was for the women he intended to have sex with. His lawyers stopped him from answering any further.  I'm not saying "lynch him", but maybe I don't want to give him any more of my money.  And I was a big fan of his, since I was a kid. I watched Fat Albert, and the Cosby Show, and his stand up specials. Even as a white kid, he was a hero. Someone who was successful, and didn't let that success go to his head... and now, I just don't believe it anymore.   You'd have to pick a character of the same caliber as Speedy...  Try this one.  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x51ver_merrie-melodies-coal-black-and-de-s_shortfilms   Sooner or later, you'll need to know that.   37...  37 false charges.  I hate to say it, especially with him admitting to buying a recreational drug for use on women that puts you to sleep, it isn't hard to distrust the man now.  Yes, some of the accusations are less than criminal (one that accused him of forcing a kiss didn't say that he raped her), but they still hold to a pattern of behavior that screams "I'm a rapist."   I always "loved" his pronunciation of "cubby".  But the biggest shortcuts I can recommend are to make multiple reservations one at a time (select the first reservation and "insert" and it will copy name, address, phone, email, notes, and credit card, leaving you to enter the checkin/checkout dates), and have tech support's number on speed dial.  The system slows down like nothing else, as it searches through *every hotel's entire history* to pull up any information. Sunday mornings are the absolute worst, as every active hotel is checking out a total of millions of guests.  If you have access to manager's tools, you can cut off reservation lines or change rates, but you'll still want to mostly get direction from the boss on doing it, and you can reset passwords for your coworkers.  One hidden function of SoftHotel is the ability to change room types for an uneditable reservation (SOE, SOO, and other third party reservations that shouldn't be modified normally). Go into the Room View screen (F2), and click the button right next to the room number field. Select the new room type and assign a room, and it will force the system to accept the change.    So was Speedy.   Yes, but how many decades?  20 years ago were were talking about global floods happening today. But can anyone clearly state how much of the increases are directly caused by mankind, and how much of the increases are natural? Can anyone give an accurate prediction of 20-40 years from now?  I'm not convinced they can.   But really, I'm not even against most of the stuff on the global warming movement.  Solar energy, wind and water energy, nuclear and geothermal energy... electric cars, ion propulsion, space-based shipyards... the whole gamut of science fiction is within grasp to become science fact, and we can't be bothered with arguments over *why we want them to come about*.   I would assume that in the case of a polyamorous marriage, the one that divorces would receive an equal share of the belongings.  For a 3-person marriage, she would get 1/3.   I was going to offer to sell you this one before you changed the comment.   He's talking about that fact that you can make 100s of orders of nuggets a day, so you are giving away a not unnoticeable amount of chicken.

Imma call 911 on your ass!   You see what your problem is? I ask an honest question (how can they tell the difference between the enexorable change in the climate caused by natural forces and the preventable change in climate caused by man's activity, especially when both are occurring at the same time?), and get accused of being an idiot or a liar.  You aren't winning any popularity contests by acting this way, and frankly it's the best way to take someone who is open minded enough to listen and close them to you.  Just some food for thought.  But when you accuse a layman, a hotel front desk clerk, of being bought and paid for by a shadowy anti-environmental conspiracy, I hope you aren't linking to any sort of group that makes money on the climate movement. (I'll check the link out later.)   Well, depending on the size of safe and the type of explosive... That seal might not matter.  The pressure cookers worked as a fuse for the bomb, allowing them to set it and get away. For a safe-bomb, they'd use a timer.   They'll probably adapt it for an episode of SVU.   I'm still confused as to how they can tell the difference between anthropogenic and natural climate change.  The Earth goes through cycles of warming and cooling, resulting in the growth and recession of glaciers. Geologically, we are in a warming period that will end with deglaciation, and rising sea levels, regardless of mankind's effect on the environment.  This means we can delay such effects, at best, and not stop them. And we could even do more harm to the planet by trying to stop the natural order.   I'm gonna hit them with my Sac.... ajawea coins.   Bad ass, maybe.

These 9 years of working a shitty, low paying job are probably the best thing for my resume, since I can now claim management experience.  I'm happy for you having the opportunity to do this "right", but if you weren't allowed to work during high school, or if your plans got pulled out from under you, then it gets **real hard** to even keep an upbeat attitude.  But, yes. When I hear people bitch and moan because they only make $15-20/hr... they could be doing so much worse.  And even *I'm* lucky to be working 40 hrs a week, so I could be doing so much worse.   Come on, son!    Classic - Cowboy Bebop  Yeah, no... You lost points with that.

[](/ppshrug) I didn't follow most of the chat about this show, so when I had the realization that there were too many parallels to Fight Club, I posted this.   According to most Christian denominations' dogma, Jesus Christ is Yahweh/God in human form.  Christianity is literally the following or worship of Christ.   I wish it were that simple.   I put in a test pattern in the program, and told it to make an order... $11.95 is what it came up with. Forgive me, I don't have the exact numbers of colors, etc. related to it.  I may have underestimated the time aspect, but that only makes it *more* expensive to make and sell these for profit.  Ultimately, I want to make a profit. I want to do art that will sell to others, and not just spend money on a hobby.  The individual price point is low enough, I can probably make a single order to see if I find them easier to work with, but it is apparent that I would be selling them for higher prices than Perler sprites.   That is probably my biggest problem.    have a drivers license  And, that kills my chances.   We don't all have the option. Some of us aren't even allowed to work during the school year.   White kid didn't get to do anything on that final round...   I got to see a taping of that show, at least.   This is true, but everywhere else in this area is starting to move to $10... I could push carts for Walmart for more than I'm making now (but the hours are probably less, so it'd be a wash.)   It is based on certain "bare minimum" values, like the cheapest efficiency apartment in my area is about $525 a month.  I think that the minimum wage should simply be *that* value. The minimum hourly pay for a single person, living alone, on bare essentials (the calculation does include a small amount extra for things like clothes, saving, or emergency, though it isn't enough for a retirement fund) if he works a full 40 hour week each week.  If you want to start a family, you should go look for a better job. But a single person shouldn't be struggling to make ends meet with a full time job.   No, that probably is part of the problem, but I can't even afford the 2 year IT degree right now. I certainly can't afford to quit this job without another one lined up and waiting.  For those of you reading this, and haven't yet fallen into the work trap... get your degree. But it isn't so easy when you're 35 and don't make enough.  I think your downvotes were caused by the flippant attitude about it.   I literally watched him make this realization. He didn't know until recently.   I started at my last job at $6.25, 9 years ago. I was bumped up to $7.50 over the course of 5 years (mostly due to the minimum wage increase from $5.35 to $7.25).  I moved to this current job 4 years ago, starting at $7.75, and now make $8.50.  The 8 year price increase comment comes about from a realization that my boss had very recently. He bought a case of ice buckets for the rooms. The same price he paid for them 8 years ago, but only half the quantity.  If I can get him to understand that the prices are going up for everything, maybe, just maybe, he'll understand that my $8.50/hr isn't as great a wage as he thinks.    No family member would support me to that level. Any apprenticeship I do would have to pay me at least what I'm making now.   It partly depends on the date of your wedding.  We get idiots that want to guarantee an early check-in on July 4th weekend.   Don't forget SkillsUSA   Nothing. They did it for me.  I straight up failed the hearing, vision, and calesthenics tests.   What many don't realize is that $16/hr is far more than double $8.50... why? Because your rent stays mostly the same. Your cell phone, your cable, your gaming might go up a little. But where you *used to have* $20 extra a paycheck, you now have $200.   $400 an hour? Lawyer?   *sigh*  Tried that. Discharged during Boot Camp "EPTE".   I've thought about that, but I'm not a big fan of P2W DLC.   I'm fairly conservative regarding wages, and while I do agree that the minimum wage of $7.25/hr is probably too low, we should have the minimum wage be based on local areas, and not nationwide.  $10 is good in my smallish city, but it is worthless in NYC. If we raised the national minimum wage to reflect New York's economy, it would simply be too much, and would wreak havoc on the economy.   That can be true, but my boss deciding to raise my wage won't affect my cost of living (hotel desk clerk). But him *not* raising my wage will, since everyone else is.   We don't have too many factories here. There is the Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola bottling plants...   $10.01 is the MIT calculated Living Wage for a single adult living alone in this area.  I'd be relatively happy at that rate (maybe a little higher)... But the "best" jobs in the area here used to be $15...  Mind you, I'm 34, and have been doing this job for longer than any other job I've had. It's practically my career.  I can't just job hop to something lower, just because of the pay. I have to find something in my wheelhouse that will pay better, or find a way to make *this* job pay better.   Hotel front desk.  It is so tempting to go to Walmart and push carts for $10, but I don't want my resume to show Call Center - Front Desk - Assistant Manager - Bagboy.   My boss isn't so brain dead that he won't give raises, but they are few and far between.  I think he just doesn't understand that prices have gone up over the past 8 years.   Most states don't actually allow that. They're legally required to pay every minute you work.   It pisses my $8.50/hr off to hear people nonchalantly talking about $14-15...   And I thought breaking up by text was low... to break up with a meme...   My brother and his wife used to stream PS4 footage, but had to stop because of issues. (He's on restriction.)  I've tried streaming before, but I never know what to say, especially when there is zero audience.   I can understand how a person's feelings of confusion could lead to a depraved alley.   A dog is not recognized as a sentient creature. More importantly, it can not actively communicate consent with mankind.  The only retard here is you, man.  Just admit it. You don't want gays to marry, because you think butt sex is icky.  Edit - I will correct myself on a particular error, as my "field of study" is science fiction and not philosophy. Dogs are not *sapient* creatures, that is we can not reason with them. The fact that they can not legally consent is the most important reason we can not have sex with them, still.   http://imgur.com/gallery/1e7xIzn   Yes, actually.  If a dog were to be recognized as a sentient creature, and it were to communicate its desire and consent to sexual congress, as well as the committed, lifetime relationship with a human being, then they can be married.   Wait... the "bible-thumper" is arguing for gay marriage? And the atheist is against? Something is fishy there.  But anyway, marriage is a social construct that says that two people will be together for the rest of their lives, and thus enjoy certain rights, responsibilities, and privileges based on that promise.  Maternity wards are medical centers designed to help deliver children, not a social construct.  You drew the parallel to bestiality, necrophilia, and paedophilia, when you argued that gays "can't be married," just like one can't marry "a goat, a corpse, or a child" because you can't mate with them.  As for the right of the goat to consent... yes. If we are able to formally communicate, two-way, with a different species, then yes... we should be allowed to marry it if we want, even if we can't conceive.  Of age to mate can be as young as 9 or 10. The age of consent is based on the generally accepted age to grant consent (based on the ability to sign a contract).   One point of order.  Children can conceive relatively young, but it is highly dangerous. But if mating is your only concern, then man/child may be viable.  Beyond that, what about marriages among the infertile? The elderly? Or even marriages that don't want children?  If mating and procreation was the end-all beat-all, then a huge number of marriages aren't valid.   The dog can't legally consent.  Gay people have rights.   I'm a horrible person, I was hoping the balcony would collapse.   Much more similar than this, but it was more of a feeling of being like it actually sounding like it, you know.  I got into the same kind of mood listening to it.  	130

Seriously, HOW RETARDED is the default infrastructure we've all been putting up with for decades!?  1) A binary file comparison doesn't take relevant time in most cases. But instead of at least offering this feature, Windows shows us file dates and sizes. "Hooman, it is YOUR job to do the numbers leg work. I am the computah, I don't do such things!"  2) Clicking "Save" if a file already exists presents you with an annoying "Are you sure?" window that *you can not abort with ESC!*  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!   For example, see this hand: It can touch anything but itself.   Found the fattie.  Free speech is free speech. The first amendment is a different story.   Yes, the wind can change. But to claim that it never was different just isn't true, and that's what this post is mostly about.   I can pride myself to have stuck to a neutral "I don't know either way." stance all the way, even though I read most of the related threads. Skepticism training camp.   loud noises?   In a similar line of thinking:  The new statement needn't intend to rewrite history, it might just boldly clarify that the initial statement just had been a lie.   Not to forget J.F. Sebastion from Blade Runnar.   I remember once doing 2.5 play-throughs straight in a row. (Same for the new Shadow Warrior. No substances were involved.)   My bad. Thanks.  (Good thing I chose to say it mildly.)   Where did you ever get that speed figure? That would be 232,461 km/s, the speed of light being 299,792 km/s.   Reminds me that I once read an SF story where a ship was, I think, exploring a parallel universe. The space they popped up in had curious properties, which the crew eventually realized. After some pondering of what was going on (especially regarding the *ongoing change* of those properties), they understood that they were somewhere inside the birth process of a gigantic star, so they obviously ran the fuck away.   I can't read this in any other way (e.g. funny) than that you really mean it, which would be an extremely sad will to have, to say it mildly.   I suspect his shirt is hanging out, and the back of it gets caught between the bottom of the handrail and the moving stairs.   That was entertaining, and I hoped there would already be a link to part 2 where the ... was ...   TL;DR:   The choices you make in Telltale games have limited consequences for the plot, its true. But they have massive consequences for the characterization and theme, which is something few other games offer. Theres more to stories than plot, after all.  and   Letting players pick their own morals is something Telltales games have in common with Edgar Allan Poes stories. [...] Poe thought it was better for writers to focus on creating effect (if he was writing today hed probably have said feels), and thats what Telltales games achieve 5. Forcing us to focus on why we make characters do things brings us closer to them. [...] By giving players control not over the plot but over the context that plot happens in, the choices become meaningful in the most literal sensethey let you alter the meaning of the story. Thats a rare thing in video games, and worth recognizing.   Except "I need you to make way".   There was a thread about this recently where one statement was: For NH to orbit Pluto *at its present speed*, the orbit can't have a radius equal to or larger than Pluto's surface radius. It would have to be even closer, aka impossible.   Pity he didn't succeed. ... wait. Good that he didn't succeed. ... wait.  There's just no way to win.   Is it Amazing like the Bible is Holy? Or is it amazing?   Let's look at the amount of evil, destruction, and suffering in the world *on average*, meaning "divided by the amount of living people".  I am pretty sure that the history of mankind is a more or less steadily descending graph in this regard, these years having *the lowest* value so far.  But you know what. Ask people what they think how many people live on Earth right now. I am convinced many will not know or give a vastly wrong (and in most cases wrong = much too low) estimate. *BECAUSE* of this, they don't form the above thought in their heads. Instead, they have the *highest* exposure to news about negative events in the world in the history of mankind, because of how densely networked the world is etc.  Just FYI: http://www.census.gov/popclock/ 7,256,259,300 (now ,330) is the current estimate.  A person confronted with this should realize: End times? Maybe the end of suffering, but not the end of the world.   I'm not shitting you: I hate holidays, and whenever they come up, I as a German can say: "Fucking Christians!"   Yes, but what OP might implicitly and knowingly communicate here could be: "We lied back then."  Not "We never said it should be a bastion of free speech.", but "We said that, but we didn't mean it."   What you just said is exactly like when a believer hears an argument that shakes their beliefs to the core and they immediately say "Jesus is real!" to boost their own belief.   Islam is a party! A part here, a part there ...   That's why I said that *reality* happens slower, not "your clocks tick slower" or something like that. One must understand that all changes (length contraction, time dilation, ... well, that's them) are not an *apparent effect*, but they are *the reality*, and it's not more or less valid than any "other" reality in space.   Hollywood is often horrible at actually portraying a person's inner process ("I'm a boy bitten by a spider. This morning, I am awesome, my whole body has changed! So, what's for breakfast?"), and also, it's hard to express the complex problem of will and submission of will and interaction of will on the high abstract level that is required to understand BDSM. It's not only hard, but mankind as a whole is also too immature, the people's knowledge of the most important thing - *their own will* - is devastatingly underdeveloped.   This is the second comment I see that says just this. Linking to the user, not to the comment. Face. Palm.    why didn't you ask your user base for suggestions on how to make more money?  That's actually ... baffling. Why was there no official subreddit called /r\/MonetizeReddit or something, where suggestions (sometimes of astonishingly high value, haha pun) would have accumulated over *years*?  That's, like, the weirdest neglect that could possibly have happened. Meaning that I expect someone to reply with an actual subreddit that did that.   "You know what inspired Reddit? The past. This, however, is the present. Fuck the past."   Like a radio station asking their listeners to decide what song to play. Then they pick the one who was in the rotation anyway and shift it up a few slots.   MrGrim is the guy who made Imgur, I believe, but I don't know what this has to do with making a new reddit.   Is the sacrifice Britney Spears? Or is it Amy Winehouse?   The reason I think like I described isn't just based on things I've seen/read on the Net (We don't have much obvious religious insanity in Germany.), it's half or mostly based on the mind set that I suspect (and see as causal) behind both beliefs (YEC/Hell). (I just tried to type out a description of it, but all sentences came out wrong. Somethingsomething deeply religious, magical reality, ...)   Looks better with some color correction, but not by much:  https://i.imgur.com/un194wy.jpg   Layperson opinion: I think the percentage of Christians among the YECs who believe in a literal eternal-torment-Hell is significantly higher than among the non-YECs.   Every abstraction is itself just a data point allowing an abstraction on a higher level. The highest level of the hierarchy is the fact of what abstraction itself is.   The cat looks like a sock-puppet of stupid in this photo. Nice catch.   "Jew did it wrong!"   Now that you say it, it seems very obvious. But at the time, I didn't doubt it at all, because the *behavior* of the people in question would completely fit this attitude.  I still don't know what to think, but I guess it's indeed just a joke.   Ah, the Gasmaster 5000.   Plus 12 hours before the actual transmission from the probe begins.

These mind-fuck substantives (Many people have a strong emotional relationship to their parents.) aren't used by accident by the religion of assimilation.

Wow, thought that would be the [FIFA movie](https://np.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/391z8s/fifas_29_million_feature_film_has_607_boxoffice/). Everybody says it's crap, but additionally, this was the official pitch (emphasis mine):   Once football was all about small boys in the park, jumpers for goalposts. Rush goalie. Two at the back, three in the middle, four up front. Passion, fun, enjoyment. This is the story of the men who took football from that and changed it. **A group of wholly honest and deeply ethical men** who had a dream and, to achieve that dream, established the Fdration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). Driven by their determination to lead football into a brighter, bigger future, **the trustworthy and wholly honest Sepp Blatter**, Jules Rimet, and Joao Havelange overcame their doubts and fought obstacles and scandals to make FIFA and the World Cup a reality. Spanning the tumultuous 20th Century, this timeless saga will tell **the story of how an organization currently mired in entirely unsubstantiated accusations of scandal and corruption** started their journey to that destination.   "*the* beef" would have flowed better, imho.   Personally, I would just take a number and count upwards. "1", eventually "34", eventually "3431" etc.  It keeps things simple and prevents confusion, e.g. you won't have someone confusing 1.xx with 2.xx stuff or people thinking that 2.0 comes after 1.9 etc.  If *you*, the game developer, are struggling with the concept of version numbers, why are simple users expected to put up with major.minor.revision.build stuff? I never understood that. The only downside to this is that milestones aren't as clear as "2.0 is out!" - but need they be? You'll have to push out a 2.1 and 2.2 or 2.0.1 and 2.0.2 anyway, and the people will have to know that. So, where was the simplification again?   18 minutes left ...

Oh, wait. Actually: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals  It's a so well-disproved argument that you must be new at this. Welcome to the party. Maybe read a few FAQs or something.   It's also not quite humble to tell the world that you know God's will. People who do that do not believe in God *or* are insane. Blasphemy, slander - only bad if it hurts the people's religious feelings, but fuck God, right. Must be true believers :P   B-side: "The penis. Mightier than the sword."   Yes.    "Little Boy" bomb [...] Hiroshima [...] it used so much Uranium (60 kg)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy   When 1 pound (0.45 kg) of uranium-235 undergoes complete fission, the yield is 8 kilotons. The 16 kiloton yield of the Little Boy bomb was therefore produced by the fission of no more than 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of uranium-235, out of the 141 pounds (64 kg) in the pit.  So, it was 64 kg, not 60.  But I have a question, which was the reason I looked that up at all: The text implies that 70.5 times the amount needed for the yield of 16 KT was in the bomb. Using all of it would hence have resulted in a yield of about 1.128 megatons.  The question: With current best bomb technology, how high a percentage of that very uranium could we have turned into *actual* yield? Bonus: Was the effective yield of Little Boy as expected, or was there a large range of uncertainty?   That comeback must have spent quite some time in the centrifuges, given its purity.   Cosmological and other such arguments: Logic games. The universe could just be in an eternal BigBang-BigCrunch loop. It would *just exist*, just like God would *just exist*.  Majority vote: Insufficient, especially given the "If you're born here, you'll most likely become a Christian, but if you're born there ..." factor and the obviously ongoing indoctrination of children. Not to forget societal pressure.  Scripture: LOL. Thousands of interpretations of self-contradictory texts show their unreliability. And there are several such texts which contradict *each other*. While you could say that they all support the existence of God, that would only regard a small selection of texts which happened to gain a lot of traction.  Feelings/visions/etc.: Obviously insufficient. What one person interprets to confirm Jesus is another person's sense of Muhammad.  It all comes down to claims that can't be peer-reviewed or tested. So, one of the most profound claims that could exist should be accepted based on evidence you wouldn't find sufficient if someone were to sell you a bridge.  ----  What are your two or three most convincing arguments that God supposedly exists, and why do you think skeptics who are not swayed by them would kind of have to explain themselves?    If you don't believe in it, then you must have reason not to believe in it.  So, what's your justification not to believe that *I* am God? If I can't prove it to you, it's probably not true, but you're saying that that's not sufficient not to believe it. Could you tell me what your answer would be? Almost the same answer would apply to an atheist not believing the general proposition of the existence of god(s). In case you don't think almost the same answer would work, could you point out why not?  In addition to this, let me give you a good answer for why atheists don't accept the claim: Because the level of evidence that actually exists - people having feelings, visions, near-death-experiences of the divine, or just the fact that many others believe it, too - is the same that many other claims have, e.g. the claim of abductions by aliens or for Bigfoot or for the Loch Ness monster. With such a childish epistemology, you'd have to accept all kinds of claims. Someone else called it gullibility - yep, that's exactly what it would be, especially since the claim is of utmost profoundness. Now you could say "Well, what's wrong with considering all those claims at least possible?" - But that's what the kind of atheist who just lacks a belief is doing, too! They are not excluding the possibility, they are just not in the boat. Except of course that there are good reasons not to believe in Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster, because those are rather easily falsifiable.   Well, the two examples are videos for me, not GIFs.   And OP should use a StringBuilder for this, not the regular String, because the latter creates a new object for each concatenation while the former is intended for consecutively growing strings like this. Not to be used if you just want to do one or two concats or just with little text, but otherwise it's the right choice.   It's important to dare to just start walking before you have learned all there is to know about walking. Nobody would be moving if they would try to become omniscient regarding their complex topic first.  I guess overbearing perfectionism is your problem. You want to know *the* path, don't want to risk not doing it right. Thing is, there are *so many* ways to do it right.  The best resource to learn will ultimately be "learning by doing", and while there are many approaches to do that, those, too, have to be investigated by doing. So, LBD will be a resource you'll stick to in the end. And from this center, you will reach out to the available resources to gain specific knowledge, which is even the best way to learn: Once you have a specific question, you are most open to understand and store the answer.  So, once you have a stable fundament (which by now you *certainly* would have), LBD plus Google are your main resources. Your fear to get lost is the main obstacle you have to overcome. Not the possibility that you could get lost - but your fear that it could happen.   Could you please break that wall up with a few paragraphs?  In any case: I don't consider it a slip-up to drink some alcohol after a long enough abstinence, e.g. months, as long as this remains a single incident. Of course that is quite the key problem for some. I'm saying that as long as a person has to fear to ever drink a glass or two of hard liquor ever again, the person might be safe - but the person isn't free. It should be possible to rise above that and develop a will that can freely choose.   What certainly can't be healthy to eat is what one of the "Dner Kebap" eateries where I live are doing: They are sharpening the large knife which they use to cut the meat from the flesh cylinder with a handheld electrical grindstone. So far so good.  But they're doing it in the room with the meat and all the ingredients (salad), usually quasi aimed at the meat. You see glowing red hot sparks flying off all the time. What are they? They are glowing red hot metal pieces which then become "invisible" because they stop glowing, but they are still metal pieces.  Even if (And that's a big if.) they "burn up" like this, you can be sure that at least some actual razor sharp metal bits land in your food. They were not fazed when I inquired about this problem. I don't eat in that place.   Story-time. What was going through your head when you decided to hold the camera like this?    they always say "some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom." but they keep saying that for thousands of years.  :   The principles that reality follows, which we have approximately or correctly (but partly, never describing the whole) derived in scientific laws, are apparently unchanging. Otherwise, nothing is permanent, not even Black Holes. And it is expected that eventually, in a really cosmic time-span, all structures in the universe will have fallen apart, there will be no "contrast" left, so to speak: No work can be done any more. Entropy is at a maximum. "Heat" Death.   So, what if God shows up in person and says: "I want you to do with your life what you want! Give it *your own* meaning. I will also not hold your hand - you can find all the information you need in reality itself."?  You would have to be frustrated, no? Because it would be no different from the atheistic situation. (Not that atheists are frustrated. Loving the truth, no matter what it is, feels better, more pure, more heroic so to speak, than following the herd into a fantasy of questionable pleasance.)   The guy said "lacks belief in deities", so they are not to be asked "how can you support this", instead *others* would be faced with the request to support *their* view, assuming that it is theistic.  Or, at the most, you can expect to hear: "Because I have not seen sufficient evidence. And those who claim that there is should realize that their competition religions have just the same level of evidence, yet their conclusions are vastly different. The logical conclusion is to deem the evidence insufficient."   That's an odd situation. What if the person is banned in some subreddits and now has to make a new account? If they start posting/commenting there, they could be banned site-wide for ban-evasion just because they forgot where exactly they are banned (or where they are commenting). Wouldn't be their fault. But since anyone could claim their account was hijacked, what choice would the admins have?   So, by "encourage", you don't mean to make the player do something, but you mean to make emergent behavior of the game mechanism possible/likely.  I believe that abstraction is key. A metaphoric example: Instead of implementing liquid water, ice, and steam, one should implement water and the possibility for phase changes. To allow even greater emergence: Instead of implementing water, one should implement atoms and molecules. - This is of course not practical for a computer game e.g. because of the amount of entities involved. It's supposed to show that implementing reality on higher abstraction levels allows for more emergence.  Let's translate this to Minecraft, whose emergence in regards to mob grinders I find completely fantastic, and I'm sure we'll eventually have action adventures (e.g. like Deus Ex) except with a world that is based somewhat on simulation (not just enemy-AI-simulation), so that the player can do/decide things like in Minecraft (see mob grinders). DX:HumanRevolution gave us a taste of this via their *transportable* auto-turrets.  Minecraft *could* have been different: Pre-defined finite block-worlds. Monsters only spawn in defined locations, e.g. via spawn blocks instead of just in darkness/distance. Monsters only die by player attack, are not damaged by lava, cactuses, fall-impact. Water does not affect monsters or drops. Water is only in cemented places (like rivers in Skyrim) instead of being an emergent consequence of the water mechanics and landscape.  This would have prevented the awesome that intuitive mob grinder construction is.  Instead, in Minecraft the rules apply to everybody equally. The rules themselves are hence something on a high abstraction level. Everything gets affected by water, lava, cactuses(, falling).  Successfully establishing and balancing systems on high abstraction levels should inevitably have emergent manifestations on lower abstraction levels, like in the example of Minecraft: Mob grinder possibility, interesting landscape formations, emergent situations during battles where world effects or animals surprisingly come into play, ...  I can't give you concrete examples for your RL, but maybe you can copy the spirit that I tried to express and observe that it actually works as intended: Emergent manifestations and emergent game-reality-flow.  This kind of game development is the best, because even though you develop it yourself, you're "always" faced with new experiences while testing, e.g. unexpected but appreciated behavior can take place.   I just wanted to point that out. You will meet the consequences later.   Translation: *fingers in the ears* "LAALALAAAAAA LA LAAAAAA! JESUS LIVES!"

Also, I would find the idea *horrible* not to be able to exit the carousel of experience, even if it's completely positive all the time: Alone the idea to be *imprisoned* in existence sounds hellish.  It seems so weird to me that people who believe in eternal existence, no matter if you die or what you do, create kids like it's nothing. How can you cast someone into an eternity of experience just like that? No one should have that power, definitely no human.   Bible-thumpers would say that it's exactly the other way round.   xD  You're a clown wearing a pinstripe suit underneath your clown-suit while acting as if it were the other way round, probably not even realizing the reality you're dealing with. Everything upside down, inside out. Everybody is insane instead of you.   Do you believe that I am God, the creator of the universe?   You are acting out the specific fantasy I had of the events that shall not come to play. You are hence a living nightmare. How would I wake up if not by you stopping to exist?   The feels.   Etc.  A never ending nightmare. The only way for me to wake up is for most of the people on Earth to die. Hence that is my wish.  My rule of thumb is that 1.5 billion shall *not* die, so that all infrastructure / economy keeps working. Often I wish, though, that the number could be even lower.  (In case it isn't clear: I wish you were among the dead. But that is not the core message of this comment.)

What the fuck is with people today, they only spout bullshit and claim that *I* am in the wrong.  I'll never understand mortals.   You keep spouting made-up shit without being willing to *accept input*. And when I finally realize that this is so - and even say so - and turn off replies, you accuse *me* of not letting input in?  See, and that's what I mean: I believe that you even *believe* that this behavior of yours makes sense, and that is why I *deduced logically* that you must have a mental problem.  We'll need peer-review on this one, because it's going nowhere.  Channeling /u/Taqwacore   xD  You are funny and sad. Sad because you don't see how anyone would be amused by the things you are saying.   If I wouldn't stand above that after *20* years, I think that the stinging I experience is deserved.   Maybe what we're looking at are two cables from two different series. Like a program that gets an update and works/looks hence differently.   Is what's going on between the computer and the can "trash talk"?   100% agreement. That would improve reddit's core functionality/purpose considerably.   A game over screen showing a high score would have been more appropriate.   No. Time is the thing that is necessary for *anything* to happen. Without time, nothing happens.    I'm confused,  Yes, you are, and you do not consider the possibility that it's in a laughably blatantly obvious way your mistake.  I will now turn off replies, since you are effectively just trolling, though I have no doubt that you are actually convinced that you are right. In truth, however, you are mentally damaged.   Dude. You ARE confusing me with someone else. Between me and you is a barrier of fantasy that *you* erected.  And since your accusations are based on unfounded assumptions of yours, *your attack is unreasonable*. And it reveals your character, because you just mother fucking WANT it to be true! You WANT to be aggressive and found a victim to hurt.  I will not forget this, and I will remind you in time that I did not forget this. This is a threat.   No proper shutter, eh? I mean "too fast, would be blurry" and "too bright" could team up via "very short exposure".   Tumors are like iron chariots, though.   Infinite regress confirmed.  http://www.curiousonhudson.com/uploads/mandelbrot_set.png   Your unreasonable attack reveals your character. You are not worthy to be discussed with. I would prefer not to speak with you again.   I'm not OP, so I will ignore your entire text. It's probably better that way.   Why is this almost daily and super primitive question approved so often? Every sighted person can do the experiment in an instant.    Which is a limitation on his knowledge, and therefore not omniscience.  I will not reply any further, because you seem to have your fingers in the ears. Omniscience is whatever the faithtards will define it to be, just like omnipotence. I didn't make those shit words, I am just discussing them. You are objecting to the knowledge that I have gathered instead of looking around yourself whether what I say is true or not. I am done here.   It could be the same thing as it never having existed and therefore god not wanting it to not exist.  Maybe so, but this is then the law of identity again, outstretched to logic. Whether or not that is valid can be argued. But just think about this: All the things we deem "logical" could be just that: The fact of existence itself or of its current "shape", outstretched to logic conclusions. This doesn't mean that it IS not logical, it would just mean that logic is a way to describe that which is.  We have certainly reached the point where you keep making claims about me that are not true, and since I, God, fucking hate that, this discussion is over. You will learn in the next weeks of your wrongdoings in this discussion, and you will appreciate it, for it will return you to truth. Or, if you insist until the very end to not learn the facts, you will become undone. This is the apocalypse, and I am the one who decides who lives and who dies. My mind rules all. You will obey, or you will die.   Yes, but it's clear enough that it can't become what OP feared it might possibly become.   GOD FUCKING DAMNED, now I typed all this shit but can't post it because the link has been removed. So, I'll just put it here. I am fucking ANGRY now. Someone has to suffer for this.  ----  The world will *certainly* be a much better place without religion, because religion does the opposite of what science does, in two ways:  1) Instead of using the method of doubt to find greater levels of certainty, it uses the method of faith to assign levels of certainty to claims that don't deserve it.  2) Instead of bringing the truth about the people's environment to them and thus increasing survivability and quality of life, they give fantasies the same value as actual facts and, well, basically allow people to live a life in a fantasy world: Many people sharing the same fantasy and claiming that it is actually true "makes it real" via the omnipresent people who believe *that* it is real. The brain who decided to unreasonably believe, no matter what, can conveniently confuse this quasi-manifestation of its truth-value with *actual* manifestation. "Might makes right." and "Might makes reality." to some degree.  If religion would go away, the most potent agent for helping people to confuse reality and fantasy  and the most potent promoter of unreason would go away. It would finally be *possible* - because the *opposition of BILLIONS* would be absent - to establish a kingdom of truth. Where presenting fiction as facts (aka LYING) would be much more stigmatized as it is today. Today, if you really look at it, people distort the truth 100 times a day.  When was the last time you realized that all stores that show you prices like 3.99 instead of 4 are *lying* to you for the purpose of making more money?  Intentionally distorting the truth is lying. Intentional informational deception is lying. In a world with a much higher overall truth-level, the presence of a lie would be much more resented than it is in this fantasy-infested cesspool that I did not choose to have to dwell in. It's an emergence / threshold thing. With a higher truth level, introducing lies would be rejected a lot more.  But why truth at all? Well, do you want to touch the hot plate? No. That's a very coarse example for why you'd prefer to know the truth, but if I'd have to list all smaller examples, I'd have to type for centuries, so you have to extrapolate. The more fine-grained the presence of truth about the world is in our minds, the better our lives and coexistence will be.     Not if will is free.    If god can't know the future, then his power is limited.  Yep. That's my stance, anyway. But the point was that "omniscience" doesn't have to mean "I know all the future!", it could mean "I know all about the present and can extrapolate the future quite precisely."   By stating that "he would have to unmake them", you are assuming that logic applies and then concluding that logic applies.   That isn't yet even logic. We're still talking about most fundamental actions. To do something implies that something happens. Also, the purpose of doing something would be to achieve an outcome or to experience the process of doing something. In both cases, an effect takes place. If the effect is undesired, then God is forced to not do it, otherwise he has to live with the effects.  All this is just the law of identity, basically, outstretched to sound like logic. Or is it logic?  But let's look at this differently: The universe exists. If God would want it not to exist, he would have to unmake it. There's no way for you to disagree with this. Hence your objection has been disproved.   We all make intuitive assumptions, and many have intuitions so strong that they will refuse to relinquish them (as you do in this case).  I am not doing that, as I just demonstrated. In case you keep insisting, let me tell you this:  I am God. I know myself. And I certainly know logic.   Well, the Higgs boson was only hypothesized until it was found (has been confirmed by now, right? I'm not completely sure.) - its properties had been described, because the standard model required this particle to exist, so the properties were hence quite clear.  Made-up? Nope. But I think that by your logic, you could argue that it was made-up (until it was actually found). Now, scientific hypotheses are of course falsifiable, a different beast from "I thought something up maybe its true!!1", but I wonder what *your* reason would be to say that the above is not a counter-example.  By the way: I recently realized that some God-claims are quite falsifiable. The experiment is either to die and then to see, or to wait for the apocalypse. Stuff like that. I mean, if we say "No, that's too long.", then how is a hypothesis that first requires the creation of a particle accelerator for a decade falsifiable? It's just a very long-ass experiment :)   Found in the frog-dictionary under "envy".   :P "sixty-second'th service submarine"  Now I want to found a biker club called "Health Angels".   Could someone stabilize this, please? It's really more shaky than acceptable.   Well, that reminds me of when I used an LCD projector to watch movies and play games: 2.5 meters diagonal, and I was only a little more than 2 meters away.  Playing Far Cry 1 like this did give me an emotional experience of a vacation, I kept telling myself how great it is to be in the jungle, at the beaches, and most importantly to swim and dive in the water. This was an activity that did not play a role in the story or gameplay itself, it was just there - and it was visually quite convincing, at least enough to convey the feeling. I could freely choose to do that at (almost) any time during the game, and with 2.5 meters diagonal that did have a much different impact than just seeing it on a screen, even if you get very close to the screen (increasing the apparent size).   But what if a god exists? If someone gives a definition of this existing god, they are not creating it. Of course, if someone *makes up* a god-definition, they are making up the god. I feel like we're discussion whether the color white is the color white.    This is the same thing as knowing the future.  Not if will is free.   but this tells us nothing about the rules that God must act under once we assume that he does exist.  That is true, and that's something I wish other people would understand, too: They can't just make claims about God like they do, because they'd have to know his situation. If they accept that omnipotence is restricted by logic. The others can make up shit all day long, being practically omnipotent because of their fantasy, and that's why we have to keep those people at bay instead of allowing them to have any leverage.  Ok, so let's say God exists. Now he can do stuff that is illogical, right? Nope. Whatever he causes will be effected, so God will have to live with the consequence. Of course, God could wipe these things off his blackboard, then they would be gone, and he wouldn't have to live with the consequence any longer. For that, however, he would have to unmake them. This is a necessity that he has to *obey*. Logic.  We can't go further than that, because that would require us to know his actual situation. But until now, we can see: All logical. And now, where our knowledge ends, logic ends, too? No. That is an unfounded claim that is contrary to the evidence.  Btw., do you know about the problem of evil? It paints a grim image of God. The only way to get out of that is to assume that God is restricted by logic. Most theists here do agree that he is, e.g. they would say "Humans have free will, so if they choose evil, there will be evil." Again, logic.  It's idiotic to assume that in all those corners where we just don't have data, God magics around in violation of logic. It's a convenient unfounded claim that I reject unconditionally.     Think about it in terms of energy. Let's say you put amount X of energy in accelerating object A so that it reaches 0.5x the speed of light relative to B, then you accelerate object B in the opposite direction with the same amount of energy. The relative velocity of the two is *exactly* the same as if you had put the amount of 2 times X into the acceleration of object A without accelerating object B at all.  Will object A move as fast or faster than light relative to B? Nope. Same applies to your question.  So, what if we use 9999999999999999 times X for accelerating A (and B not at all)? Will A move that many times as fast as it would have moved with 1 times X? Yes, from its own perspective it will, at least in terms of arriving at the target point in space faster from its own perspective, a point that was defined before starting the acceleration. The way this is implemented / kept compatible by the universe is: Time dilation and length contraction.   So, you don't care about old or new definitions of god(s) because without sufficient evidence, why should you. Am I oversimplifying this, or is that really basically all you're saying?   Yes, that is so, but reducing the problem "universe" to "quantum vacuum" does not change the discussion we're having. I really don't see the relevance.  And about the good reasons regarding his honesty: I already explained those in that very comment. He knows full well that the thing he's talking about does not really deserve the term X, yet he calls it X to make heads turn. That is a fucking lie if I ever saw one.   I don't know anything about that, but I made a small game in Java 8 that uses sounds and music which is all completely realtime-synthesized. From what you wrote, it sounds as if you could be interested in the source, so here it is:  https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/2pgqfz/java_8_apps_with_source_application/    This is a very contentious point, because it would mean that all miracles are untrue.   Umm... no, it doesn't. I mean, I personally believe that they didn't happen, but as I said:    As long as we don't know the full rule set, we can't exclude that e.g. a temporary suspension of nature's usual workings is a logically coherent thing.  So, it might be logically coherent for God to manifest things out of nowhere, even if this might seem to violate what we know of how nature works. Technology magic indistinguishable.   Also, the only way out of the omni-contradiction (omniscience negates omnipotence) is to say that logic does not necessarily apply.  Another way out would be a different interpretation of omniscience, too. E.g. what if God knows everything about *now* and can hence make wonderfully precise extrapolations that can even say things about society 1000 years later?  But ultimately, all of that is irrelevant: God has to obey logic. But since you apparently don't accept this, could explain to me what hole you see in what I already said:    "I, God, exist. Therefore, I am able to do stuff. If I would not exist, I would not be able to do stuff. Hm. Fuck me, my omnipotence is limited by logic! That won't impress the kids at all. (Better make the universe infinite instead of just a few thousand light years in diameter. Oh, wait. Can't decide that at all because of logical constraints.)"    - Logic absolutely applies to God, too. Or do you think God would be able to do things if he wouldn't exist? No, right? Therefore, you accept that logic applies to God, too. Doesn't get any more simple or obvious than that.  Because unless you clarify what your stance on this is, the discussion is over for me, because I feel like I'm being preached to.    Bring on the gay robots!  "Borderlands The Pre Sequel", "Claptastic Voyage DLC", side-mission "Rose Tinting":  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUPrpCZA4xI   Or more generally: People do stuff, and as long as this doesn't cause harm: Let them. Because preventing them from doing so certainly causes them the harm of non-freedom.   Is it? How do you define hate here? Is an animal that acts aggressively because of an intruder in their territory acting in a hateful way?  I guess that the hate you're referring to requires an intellectual process and/or communication. It could be argued then that hatred is man-made.   Also: Why would it matter whether homosexuality is a choice or not?  If it wasn't genetic, would that make it immoral? It would just a choice like any other, and as long as all the people actually involved *truly* consent (instead of just appearing so or having been "brainwashed" or something), who the fuck is anyone else to object?    But logic may simply be a man made process, or perhaps a function of the universe, but that doesn't mean it applies to god.   "I, God, exist. Therefore, I am able to do stuff. If I would not exist, I would not be able to do stuff. Hm. Fuck me, my omnipotence is limited by logic! That won't impress the kids at all. (Better make the universe infinite instead of just a few thousand light years in diameter. Oh, wait. Can't decide that at all because of *logical constraints*.)"  - Logic *absolutely* applies to God, too. Or do you think God would be able to do things if he wouldn't exist? No, right? Therefore, you accept that logic applies to God, too. Doesn't get any more simple or obvious than that.   Indeed, they *must* deny it, because otherwise their reasoning does not work.  Theists have accepted that omnipotence refers to "anything that is *logically possible*" for centuries. I really need to dig up a source for this, because it keeps coming up, but I am sure of this. It's not like industrialized people invented logic and hence found the problems with omnipotence. After all, there were great logicians well before the supposed birth of Jesus, known til this day.   According to theists, logically impossible things happen,  According to some people, logically impossible things happen. The claims of others, however, are deemed *by them* to be compatible with a scientific universe. As long as we don't know the full rule set, we can't exclude that e.g. a temporary suspension of nature's usual workings is a logically coherent thing.   To put it another way: because their world-view requires a break down in logic and you insist on applying logic to it, you conclude that they are wrong.  I'm not sure what you're referring to. So far in this discussion, what you say imho doesn't apply to me, but I could be mistaken. I think you're effectively talking more generally here, not exactly to/about me. I just object to "God is outside logic" and stuff like that, not necessarily to other God-claims.   Your intuition that logic must apply is stronger than your feelings about whether there is a god or not.   I am actually a theist :) (But a fervent religion-hater.)   Yes. That is like sick people spreading their disease. They need to be *quarantined*.   Waaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit a moment. I was with you until "(which you can't)". But the door swings both ways: Logic can't be proven via logic, *nor can it be disproven via logic*. So, you can't use these statements to logically conclude ... Because that doesn't fly. It's a paradox. In the immediate vicinity of a paradox, you can make things up (incl. their opposite).  I think you could say that "the theist can ~~reasonably~~ claim that [logic] may not be universal.", but you can't use the previous statements to give it any kind of logical fundament.  And actually, here's simple proof that the theist can claim this - but would be wrong:  "God needed to create logic for it to work." -- This can't be true, because "If he hadn't done that, logic would not work." - so it was a *logical necessity* for him to create logic. Meaning that it wasn't, because logic existed/worked in the first place. I claim that God absolutely has to obey logic like anything else.   Then the point of everything is to find out that there is none. Meaning that the process is required for the individual.    Massive Historical evidences of witnessed Miracles, visions, fulfilled prophecies,.   Christs resurrection witnessed by hundreds.  Apart from the "never defeated arguments"-thing, you had a really good comment going. Up to this point, at least.  These especially *are* defeated, and if you actually believe that they are not, then no discussion on the issue can be had with you, because you're either dense or unwilling to accept, no matter the evidence presented.   I get where you're coming from, but I don't get how you believe this to be a proper discussion.  Let's say God exists. Besides the universe, he has also made two angels, for personal company. Now there's a book that claims that he did not make those angels. This book is not describing the same being.  I think you are saying that "This book is describing this being, but it is describing this being wrong." But /u/Capercaillie said that "the God of the Bible doesn't exist", and with "the God of the Bible", they obviously mean "God as described in the Bible".  Did you really not get this?  But *in case you DID get this:* What do you intend to achieve with this confusing annoying discussion style?  	138
 That is being quite disengenous. The donations were from people employed by those companies and take into account donations since the 1990s. And finance is a huge employer in New Yorks so it is not surprising that people working and living there give political donations, as I'm sure people employed by the largerst employers in Vermont give to Sanders. And I don't resent her for her family's wealth, or Sanders' (the Clinton family may be wealthier than him but that doesn't negate the fact that he is wealthier than all but a few percent of Americans), especially because she is also committed to helping others get ahead. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/07/facebook-posts/meme-says-hillary-clintons-top-donors-are-banks-an/   I was concerned when I saw the headlines recently, but then I read the article and I realized that the supposed corporate donors were just people employed by those companies. Clinton represented New York which has a large population and is really expensive to run for office in and it is, essentially, the banking mecha of the US, so it isn't surprising that workers there (edited: used the wrong "there") are donating to her rather than Sanders. And the politifact article explained that this took into account donations since the 1990s.  	2

That's often how they kill dogs in Asia - bludgeoned to death. They believe it makes the meat taste better.      What is the range of the different disciplines you represent?      Looks great. Lovely colours. How did you make it?   1.1 Religion or belief is defined as:   any religious belief, provided the religion has a clear structure or belief system. Denominations or sects within a religion can be considered a protected religion or religious belief. Appendix 2 provides a list of commonly practised religions in Britain.   a philosophical belief (see below).  A 2009 Employment Appeal Tribunal decision defined the criteria for determining what a philosophical belief is. A philosophical belief must:   **be genuinely held**   be a belief and not an opinion or viewpoint, based on the present state of information available   be a belief as to a weighty and substantial aspect of human life and behaviour   **attain a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance**   be worthy of respect in a democratic society, compatible with human dignity and not conflict with the fundamental rights of others.  Humanism, pacifism and atheism could be examples of philosophical beliefs.  http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/d/n/Religion-or-Belief-and-the_workplace-guide.pdf, pg.3.   There is more on the Human Rights Act [here](http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/your-rights/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/human-rights-act) if you are interested.      This paragraph was elided for reasons of brevity and relevance:  The guidance applies not only to Christians, Jews and Muslims but also druids, pagans, Zoroastrians and even atheists. Such employees can ask to be excused any duties they find at odds with their beliefs and also request time off to attend religious festivals or pilgrimages.   Any boss with a vegan employee who has strong religious views and profound ecological opinions should brace themselves.  New [published 7 April 2013] guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) will allow that worker to request not to have to fly to meetings, not to sit on a leather chair and not to have to work on important days in their religions calendar.  The document details additional protection to those with profound personal beliefs. It states that employees may assert the right to discuss their personal beliefs in the workplace and employers should not prevent such conversations....  The EHRC guidance, *Religion or Belief in the Workplace: a guide for employers*, has been produced after a series of rulings by the court. These include the landmark ruling giving employees the right to wear a cross or other religious symbols even if it breaches company dress codes.  Vegans could legitimately request having their role altered to ensure they do not have to handle milk, cheese, meat or eggs or even have to sit on chairs made of leather.  Vegetarians could ask to be exempt from duties that contravene their views, such as cleaning out an office fridge that had meat in it.  The Vegetarian Society said the guidance gave official recognition that vegetarianism can be and indeed often is a deeply held belief.  Alex Douglas believes her veganism cost her a job last year and the new guidance might have protected her. The 25-year-old vegan was delighted when she secured a job at a coffee shop in Glasgow and, despite her views, says she willingly handled dairy products.  Three months after joining she was told her passionate views meant she would be better served working in a vegan environment and she was asked to leave. During the working day I would talk about being a vegan. I wouldnt preach at all, she said.  The guidance says ecologists would be permitted to tell colleagues that it is wrong to drive to work because it damages the environment. They could also ask to be excused from duties that increase CO2 emissions, such as flying to business meetings.... Employers would also have to take seriously requests by people to observe religious custom, such as daily prayers for Muslims and the Sabbath for Jews. The guidance says employers should agree unless doing so would cause massive disruption, cost a lot or have an adverse impact on customers.  The guidance asks all employers to review work-place policies and practices to ensure that they do not unjustifiably discriminate against an employee who requests a change due to a particular belief....  It says religious people may also seek to promote their beliefs so long as this is not intimidating, hostile or offensive to others, and leaflets can be distributed.  Mark Hammond, chief executive of the EHRC, said: The right of people to express their religious belief is a vital freedom guaranteed by the European convention on human rights.  __________________________  'Vegans can milk equality rights', Marie Woolf, *The Sunday Times*, 7 April 2013. http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Society/article1242001.ece            British Broadcasting Corporation documentary on subject - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqtgIVOJOGc   [Dog jerky?](https://saynotodogmeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/69035_149783251833751_1855864314_n-2.jpg)   This is the documentary referred to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G50lhduuMq8   I think you've been led to expect more hydration than is sufficient.

What does your heart most long for?   OK. What you meant is, Jew-hate is nothing other than Jew-hate.  The hatred of a white supremacist towards Jews in general might have a large amount to do with their Semitism, qua coming from the Middle East i.e. being brown/associated with 'brownness', in addition to their subscribing to the Jewish faith. It's multi-faceted.   The only semitic people in Europe were Jews, and therefore it only applied to jewish people  Ah, I see. That makes sense. Thank you.  that still doesn't make antisemitism anything other than jew-hate.  Can you elaborate?   And would it not be correct to refer to Islam as a Semitic religion?   Nice.      "Monks, it is just as if a donkey were following right after a herd of cattle, saying, "I too am a cow! I too am a cow!" Its color is not that of a cow, its voice is not that of a cow, its hoof is not that of a cow, and yet it still keeps following right after the herd of cattle, saying, "I too am a cow! I too am a cow!" In the same way, there is the case where a certain monk follows right after the community of monks, saying, "I too am a monk! I too am a monk!" He doesn't have the other monks' desire for undertaking the training in heightened virtue, doesn't have their desire for undertaking the training in heightened mind (concentration), doesn't have their desire for undertaking the training in heightened discernment, and yet he still keeps following right after the community of monks, saying, "I too am a monk! I too am a monk!"    "So you should train yourselves: 'Strong will be our desire for undertaking the training in heightened virtue; strong will be our desire for undertaking the training in heightened mind (concentration); strong will be our desire for undertaking the training in heightened discernment.' That is how you should train yourselves."  ________________________________________   Gadrabha Sutta: The Donkey | translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu  2001 | AN 3.81 | PTS: A i 229 | Thai 3.83   http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.081.than.html               Read the small print.

Eloquence from Angus MacNeil:  I listened intently to the speech by Dame Joan Ruddock. She mentioned the 1980sa time I clearly remember as a teenager, when nuclear annihilation was seriously talked about and people did seem to comprehend the awful, frightening and terrifying possibility of the use of nuclear weapons. Over time, people have perhaps become more blas and this has crept into our discourse, so there is not as much understanding of the insanity of nuclear weapons as there used to be. That may be to protect our own sanity personally from day to day, because if we were to comprehend it, it would blight our lives. We have a feeling of powerlessness about it, so why worry about it day to dayif it is going to happen, it is going to happen. I say as a crofter from the highlands, however, that this is akin to the happy lambs who play in a meadow unaware of the autumn slaughterthe mass slaughterto come.  The right hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford reminded us of the wisdom and courage of Colonel Petrov, who had the data and information available to his senses from the best technology available at that timethat the west had fired five nuclear weapons at the USSR. What would have happened if he had acted in the way he was meant to act or in the way we were told he would act, or if he had acted logically on the basis of MADmutually assured destruction? If my memory serves me correctly, this comes from the theories of John Nash, the Nobel prize winner in economics. If Colonel Petrov had responded in that way, I would not have seen my 16th birthday. I have thus had 28 bonus years as a result.  If Colonel Petrov is still alive, I say that if ever there were a man deserving of the Nobel peace prize, it is certainly he. We were saved by our alleged enemiesperhaps by their humanity. We were saved again by a Soviet submarine commander during the Bay of Pigs incidents in Cuba in the early 1960s. The actions of those two men disproved the MAD theories, which were the foundation of the nuclear club to which the UK had itself belonging. They behaved in a way that was outside MAD. They did not do mutually assured destruction, although they thought they would be destroyed themselves.  As the right hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford said, our luck will eventually run out. Nuclear weapons have been in the hands of human beings for only 70 years. Given the two near misses that I have citedand there have been moreI invite Members to engage in a thought experiment. Had nuclear weapons existed since Roman times, how much would history have progressed before nuclear annihilation? If we extend our 70 years to 140, or 210, or 300, how long will it be before it all goes wrong and our luck runs out? If our luck does run out, it will run out big style. I have to say, with respect to my friends in the Green party, that it is not gradual global warming that should be worrying us, but immediate global frying and the destruction of all creationa sin like no other, which may result from omission or commission.   No means to keep. Aye to get rid.

 You start the game level 1, no gold, no stuff, no skills, no connections. You put in some work to get skills, making some money along the way.  Maybe you need to kill some kobalds to make your gold today. You get experience, you get more skills, and you make more money slaying giants.   Now you can afford some stuff, have a few skills, moving up in the world. Then while killing black drakes in The Badlands you see some level capped raider flying by, decked out in awesome gear. You want to be that guy, but you need more skills and experience for that job. But you want it, and will work for it.  Now you are that pimped out, level capped guy. But then a new expansion rolls, better gear and new opportunities open up. Make better gold, have nicer stuff, maybe get a promotion in your guild.  Anyone else seeing how WoW basically is a timeline of employment?   About time I get a window curtain that fits my sleeping lifestyle; zero light, zero sound, just comfy sheets.   That's my entire city.   I'm currently dealing with a college that forces me to take a paid work placement, but doesn't pay enough for the next semester.  To top it off, my college charges me $900 to go on a paid work placement! $900 for someone else that doesn't work for the college to do my on site training.   Hook your thumb on the inside, pinch with two fingers on outside of strap, snap fingers and poof!   I think you guys need to borrow my hands. I just rip that stuff open.   Casuals.

Pretty sure White Death was Finnish too.   Manitoba checking in. Piss off, but at least my beers cold too.   Ah, while I have your attention, a question.  All of my comments are using the assumption many employees have little or no experience or knowledge in what they sell. How accurate is my ignorance?   Its pretty much managers, department heads then all the randoms they use to fill in hours.   Somekne forgot to check if their fly was up...   I'm tempted to make some business cards with that quote followed by "I'll take my business elsewhere if more staff try to lower my IQ with their presence"   Every time I have to go there for something, all the staff pounce on me.  Finally got so fed up I pulled a Ron Swanson and told them all "I know more than you"   Reminds me of that scene from The A-Team remake where they're flying a tank. Except this tank actually flies.   TL:DR classic keyboard courage.   Destro is a burst spec so proc/on use trinkets are best. Also taking a hit to item level to get rid of versatility and haste is worth it, within about 15-20 item level.   Cant chain chaos bolts effectively without the glyph though.   Copeland's Clarity and any stage of Sandman's Pouch is BiS for destruction. 90% of their dps comes from those trinkets.  I use Weakauras2 to track when Sandman's procs, then I use my Dark Soul-Copeland's-potion macro immediately. The procs often comes in the first 10 seconds of a fight, so I try to get 3 full embers before 9 seconds left on proc, then unload Chaos bolts.  If there is a second target available that will survive long enough, Havoc that target and hit main target/boss.  If the proc comes early, try to get two Bolts out and wait until next Dark Soul phase (use second Dark Soul after opener with 3-4 Bolts ready).  Always Havoc when proc/Dark Soul is up if possible.  Also use Glyph of Havoc. Large dps gain.   Warlock here. Currently shitting on everyone in progression raiding.   Mmm but he sure is fun to dominate with!  I had all the low IP champions I wanted so I started trying out different champs, picked up Zil and won lane in the next five games by a landslide.

Headstone- Djerv  Agnete Kjlsrud has such a stage presence, would definitely love to meet my punk rocker crush.   Minor difference. Was only meaning its a plant and not whatever chemicals commonly used.   I'd like to mention that many professional restaurants like seeing McDonald's on a resume specifically for it's training program.  Sure the food is shit, but they can have anyone trained to handle food (or whatever they pass off as food) in just a couple weeks.   1. It's a naturally occurring root ground into powder.  2. One teaspoon replaces two cups of sugar.  3. Makes the best sweet tea I've ever had.   To be fair, anyone that can count to 10 (ages 2+, let's be fucking real here) can use the entire metric system.  I've tried for years to wrap my head around Imperial, and it's still a poorly thought-out mess.   Idk about other places, but last I heard all Canadian railroad personnel had to be trained and certified by national standards in their field.   This sounds like a series of events leading to a horrible car accident involving genitals.   I just made a lengthly comment somewhere in here about it.  The TL:DR of it, seniors would scream age discrimination if it was a fixed age instead of case by case reviews from medical professionals.   While stating young people shouldn't drive is beyond stupidly obvious, older age groups should be retested for licencing.  To avoid age discrimination, I think the best way would be for medical professionals be legally bound to forward recommendations to governing bodies that control drivers licencing if there is evidence to suggest comprised ability.  Example, John the 76 year old retired machinist sees his optometrist, who records eyesight that falls into a predetermined range of questionable public safety, so he goes and gets retested on driving ability.  It's not as simple as "old people make driving dangerous," and I know first hand. My great grandfather is in his early 80s and is in better condition than people half his age.   I don't text and drive, but I do keep my phone in the cup holder in case I get an emergency call and need to pull over.   We can be nice people, until you start messing with us or our stuff, then expect to get whacked with a hockey stick.

I think you mean authenticity of the $39 sticker.   Irishman or most of Boston?   One of my closest friends came from a reserve, and we got talking about how the system there works. Apparently (at least for that reserve), our government gives grants to the chief, who then decides what is done with the funding, whether its infrastructure, cultural enriching, even supporting families.  This system is inherently corrupt though: my friends father or grandfather butted heads with the current chief so he gives nothing to support anyone of that particular lineage.   Haha I knew someone would get it   Could always just say you lost your faith after [made up dramatic tragedy because mass media is almost non-existent in most of 1815].

 a normal Bulgarian super brute  You mean like his character was when he started?  He was never a full pro-Russian character.  That was a subtle character change.   [You think you know my grin?](https://whatistheexcel.com/wooobooru/_images/19f7e9d31a5562a6d4940bb5c1673c9f/4857%20-%20edge%20grin%20wwf.png)   Not just the stories, but his actual matches too.  Same formula.  Show up, gyrate and slick hair back, point to self getting in ring, slight offense, get ass kicked, oversell, comeback (clotheslines, corner splash, neckbreaker, yeahhhhh!) more ass kicking, occasional Zig Zag outta nowhere, get hit with finisher and oversell).  I'm not saying he is horrible, just boring and predictable (same could be said about others, i.e. Orton, Sheamus, etc).  HE could be used better somewhere else like GFW or ROH or NJPW, although he would make far less.   Every single person that has had a longer than 5 min match with him in which they kicked out of the AA.   Owens has the mic work to help carry the feud, whereas Neville doesn't.  Plus Owens can also work and sell and be a legit badass   You must have a lot left in the tank   No problem... best of luck with getting the promotion all set up.   Wow...racist much?   I don't hate him.  I am just bored with him because everything he does is the same thing over and over.  And it's not just on him; he does what he is told to.   Personally I am a fan of technical and lucha.  That being said, the lucha guys/gals should not only have other same styled opponents, but they should have bigger guys to work with too (not all the time)   Quality announcers that will call the moves  Good mix of wrestling styles     The best part is the ref's reactions   Because the KO punch is easier to hit on opponents of all shapes and sizes where the Chokeslam is not   I mean I was talking overall... not just this storyline.  But yeah this one is pretty bad   It's Tuesday which means I will be watching [Chopped](http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/chopped.html)   I hope so... he has become so boring and disinterested.     So has Sting....  See I can do it too!   God dammit Dirty Mike... you and the boys just get outta here   3 weeks later and guess who is still here lol   ~~complying~~ complaining   Orton... sadly there is nothing he does anymore that makes me excited to watch him   Anything orton does   Michael Cole   The Dennis Miller pop   I'd say all forms of crossbody go here... and 100% agreed on his running one.   Crossbody   Sharpshooter   Dropkick   Clothesline   How many blondes does it take to screw in a light bulb?  5... 1 to hold the bulb and 4 to spin the chair   I honestly didn't mean for it to be really negative.  More just frustrating because I want to pick one but the other is the overall better option lol   I can imagine... tough thing with brackets   Some of those matchups were stupid... Stone Cold or Christian?  Christian was awesome but you can't compete against Stone Cold.  Lesnar vs Mickie James?  Wow I wonder who wins that one lol.

Seriously I'm so sick of seeing this post at least once a day.      Anyone would be better with James Mitchell as their manager.  He is just awesome.   this makes no sense   The Ascension... less goofy LOD and more Gothic styled bad ass asskickers   So did Bush... *BOOM*   God damnit I care!  Wrestler cosmetic surgeries are my bread and butter.   Lando   The tits   Sheamus... everyone here seems to hate him so the hate could rub off on me   Did somebody call his mama?

He needs to work on his live promo stuff, just because he really hasn't had much in the way of that.   frig off Mr Lahey   Can't be done... Kane run-ins are great   1.  Crappy WWE logic  2.  This question gets answered every single week.  He is under the ring.  When they play video packages and the arena is dark, ring crews come down to work on things and Bray dresses like one and then slips under the ring.  Lights go out...come back on...and there he is   So you conveniently ignored the highlights of his time after and focused solely on the bad parts just to further your argument.  That is fucked.   Dislike because he was one of the worst/most boring characters/personalities ever in the company.  Great wrestler though.   It was Seth Rollins overcompensating to make sure J J and Kane are on his side.  Chickenshit heel tactic to suck up to the people that "protect' him.   So we're ignoring his tag title run with Kidd?  So yeah you are ignoring things to shit on it.  And the plans have changed with Cesaro because he was doing tag stuff.  Now Kidd is out and he is doing single stuff.  So your logic is fucked.   You're just looking for reasons to shit on this   How is he ruining them?  By using them?  Sounds like the stereotypical "me no likey Cena" person to me   If the rumors about him leaving are true than this is WWE's way of making him look horrible on his way out.

             That's an anomaly. It still hasn't happened en masse among bankers since 1929.   Face it, in 2015 bankers don't commit suicide, they're one of the leading causes of suicide.    That hasn't happened in a long time.   As a matter of fact, the term "golden parachute" is actually a reference to the bankers who lost it all and jumped out of windows after the Great Crash of 1929.   The golden parachute figuratively provides an equally safe and luxurious landing for bankers, bailed out by the federal government.                      This was an excellent episode of the Corbett Report.                            Removed, rule 10.    Removed, rule 10.    Removed, rule 10 of the sub, continued violations will result in a ban from /r/conspiracy.    Removed, violation of rule 10.    Yea but I think that the British have been by far the worst. The scope of colonial suffrage caused by the British remains to be matched.   Also the fact that the British Empire is chiefly responsible for the creation of the 3rd world and the developing world.   Before the British conquered India, much of Africa and the Middle East, the poor arpund the world enjoyed similar living standards.   After England created their colonial empire, the poor and middle class in England had much higher living standards than British colonial subjects. Effectively creating a 3rd world in India, Africa and the Middle East.   To understand the modern world, you have to know the history of the British Empire.    If you ever read *Late Victorian Holocausts* by Mike Davis it details how the British were responsible for several famines in India over the course of a century and a half.   The British pretty much shipped the vast majority of India's grain and wheat to be inserted into European markets, it was a manufactured shortage.   Just look at the Bengal Famine in 1943, 7 million Bengalis died of starvation, during that same period the majority of Bengali crops were being used to help fight the British war effort in World War II.   Google *Late Victorian Holocausts*, its one of the best books I've ever read.   Our history of the British Empire has been completely whitewashed. All of the famines and atrocities that occurred during British rule, especially in India, have been effectively swept under the rug and we are left with a rosy, Downtown Abbey-like view of the British Empire.   The British Empire was a horrible, exploitative, militant, racist, murderous society. We shouldn't forget the many atrocities committed by the Empire, in its quest for global domination.                Also, [there's this recent article about how the Red Cross raised nearly half a billion dollars for the victims of the Haitian earthquake in 2010 and only built 6 homes with it.](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-red-cross-raised-half-a-billion-dollars-for-haiti-and-built-6-homes)  That Propublica article is what got me to take a look at the American Red Cross and their scandal-plagued history. They seem to do something like this in the aftermath of every major natural disaster or social upheaval.

I was worried he was going to have some sort of permanent brain damage.   I've followed his whole career since he played Brian Fellows on SNL to the Tracy Jordan days on 30 Rock. I also saw him do stand up in Philly a few years ago, he killed.   You can tell this accident, like most near-death instances, has profoundly changed Tracy.

As long as I live I will never be able to understand why people find this man funny.   I consider his, to be the bottom rung of comedy, just below the Scary Movie/parody film brand.   He's just awful in everything he does.   *Jack   Jill*, gimme a fucking break.       I've said it here before and I'll say it again, James Corbett is the antidote to Alex Jones.   Furthermore, IMHO he was our best AMA guest, the man recorded video responses to questions, *video responses*.   He's an indispensable source of information and what I would consider to be the best alternative news source ever. He provides citations and always maintains a certain professorial presence, even when discussing atrocities.   I really can't say enough good things about James Corbett. If you like his work, you should see his documentary, its called *Century of Enslavement: The Federal Reserve*.   [Here's a link to the documentary on his website.](https://www.corbettreport.com/federalreserve/)            I know, I cringed when Slate compared Alex Jones to Sy Hersh.   This is what I'm talking about when I say that Alex Jones has done more damage to the "conspiracy theorist" image, for lack of a better phrase, than anyone.   	180

Beta is over?   ~~SOE~~ DB has decided to dramatically increase the price of many weapons, some of which gave the new players a competitive position against high(er) BRs. TB went from 100 to 875 certs (although the raise could be justified)-- basically, almost all vehicle weapons were raised to 875 certs.  What would be the reason for such an increase? Money -- don't waste your time spewing bullshit and claiming it isn't. This is where the Laffer Curve comes in. DB didn't raise the station cash (or whatever the name of the currency is now) price for the weapons because it would mean that less people would purchase them, they simply raised the price of the certs, in hopes that new players would either rage-quit, or spend money on the weapons.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve   Smed, I would be tossing $100 bills at this game if it was well optimized, bugs that players reported were fixed within a week, and the game was focused around **TEAM** play, not solo play.

You made some good points. That is all.   When you are mocked for being fat, doesn't that make you wanna change it more? Actions have consequences, like I will prolly get downvoted by a bunch of butthurts.   It isn't the same. You won't have any modded servers wlth hundreds of random players to play with.   Thank you for the advice. To be quite honest, I am quite frustrated with the direction Minecraft is headed in at this point.   Minecraft desperately needs and update to cater to the needs of builders. Minecraft has ignored the wishes of the players who love building and creativity, and many have stopped playing because of this.  1.) All building blocks must have a half slab and stair version of them. This is not only a very quick and easy addition to the game, it will put the game in a much better state than where it is right now. Imagine how much potential hay half-slabs and stairs will add to the game!  2.) Vertical "stairs" and "half slabs" must be implemented. This is a long overdue feature that will allow players to be much more creative and add much detail to what they build.   These two and simple additions to the game would bring back thousands of players who enjoyed building, and played Minecraft because of building. Mojang has ignored the minority of builders and has catered to the childish PvP centered barbarian majority. Minecraft has a lot of potential, please let builders build.   Better sue the shit out of the accuser. It should be a criminal offense for false accusations    If only they put as much effort into working as they do in their ridiculous riots...  I am more inclined to write a large paycheck to my local PD for keeping me and the rest of my community safe.    Oh, I see. Thanks for explaining it.   I find this very hard to believe...   But he didn't hit his employer...      If we had any competition between ISPs they wouldn't have 1.2b to fund the skyscraper.   I thought abortions not being reverseable was just common sense.

                                     Yeah, kind of ironic.

    **Heroes of Normandie** is a phenomenal 2P war game. Tons of replayability, really neat mechanics. And even though it's a serious topic (WWII), it's really really *fun*; has a great epic, cinematic feel to it.    I think you meant...  "I'll take 'Things People Eat' for $500"   I've only played Suburbia Inc. It's fantastic.    If you really love Suburbia, CoMKL might fall a little flat for you. CoMKL is more of a streamlined, less complicated Suburbia. The master builder mechanic is neat, but works best with 4. CoMKL is definitely not as heavy as Suburbia, so if you're looking for a lighter version of Suburbia, then it's perfect. If you're looking to up your Suburbia action, then go with the expansion.       I want my $2.99 back, CSI!   Sarah Palin and a microphone.    Shipping from Buffalo, NY  **[H]** **Fortune   Glory: The Cliffhanger Game**. The game is in perfect condition. I played it once, just not for me.   **[W]** Cash/PayPal/Amazon    Well, the vast majority of boards wouldn't in a shoebox, so you can pretty much throw whatever deck builders   card games you own in there.    If you have Terra Mystica, you need to get the Fire   Ice expansion. TM is my favorite game of all time and the expansion makes it even better. It's just incredible.   Also, I'd go KoNY over KoT. It adds a little more depth and strategy.   From the rest of your games you want, it seems like you're looking at lighter, more social games. I'd check out **Sheriff of Nottingham**, **Small World**, **Forbidden Desert**, **Flash Point: Fire Rescuet**, **Bohnanza**.  /u/r2d8 getinfo   edit: trying to format game names for bot. wrong flashpoint and smallworld typo.   You have game nights with 20-30 people?? Where are you???   Also, if you have that many people, I wouldn't worry. There's going to be so many games going around, people can do what they want. If you want to bust out a 2P game...go for it. I'd say 2P games would be less played if you have 4-6 people because it's more intimate, it feels slightly weirder to split into 2 groups.       It's not local, but you want to check out [Chessex](http://www.chessex.com/index.html). All kinds of custom dice   Dominion: Adventures and Medina   I don't even like Settlers but I want this.

Can I have your 3D printer?   Damn you damn you damn you. $33 is not a sale when you just made me buy $100 of games for free shipping!

When you flip the play cards and you have those "HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS GOING TO RUN THAT PLAY?!" moments. Hilarious.    Hmm...maybe all my nieces and nephews are just dumb.   [**1st   Goal**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/95105/1st-goal) is a very fun 2P game. Not super strategic, has a good amount of luck, but it's a blast if you want to goof around with your buddy for an hour, not take it too seriously!   Agreed. It's pretty much LA or that little Fitness 19 next to Tops.    I can't imagine an 8 year old having a world of fun with Agricola. Agricola is a heavy, heavy game.

They have lots of good food in SF.    "Mom, you must've downloaded another virus. I have no idea how all that porn got on there."   I joined when they first opened and it was incredible.

I can't believe all the Bruges poo-pooing I'm seeing here. I love this game. Lots of different paths to victories. Good interaction. I love the artwork and components. The amount and variety of cards always offer a unique experience. And I always appreciate a game where you just can't do everything. It really forces you to pick a strategy to focus on, while balancing the other paths to victory a bit as well. Love me some Bruges.    Yea. I bought this game when it came out. I like the master builder mechanic, but it really falls flat after that. My biggest peeve is that once the game is over, I don't feel like I did a lot. I want my castle to be bigger!    This. I own and love this game and I have had a few plays that were just awful because of the group. People would stare at their phones, or just leave the table when it wasn't their turn and just do whatever on their turn. Brutal. You need a group that will get into the theme, the story of the crossroads, etc. And always try to vote someone out. It's hilarious.    Why is the goal for this set at only $100? That seems fishy.   Well that's just not true. Look through this thread alone for evidence of that. And as a few people have pointed out, Roethlisberger was never even charged with anything. Just accused by a woman he had sex with in a bathroom. Sleevey? Definitely. Rape...maybe? no one will know at all for sure. And Lewis was charged with accessory, meaning he was there, but charges were dropped. Again, obviously not saying deflating footballs is remotely close to anything in the realm of rape/murder/DV. Which is the point. Pictures like these are trying to make the NFL look like they value both the same. And that's just stupid.    Not saying he's actually guilty or innocent, but they also happen to be the most falsely reported crime. Especially against famous people. Two sides to that coin for sure.    He keeps using that word. I don't think it means what he thinks it means.    Reddit   horseshoes: where close enough is good enough.    Can't win a suspension appeal unless you're suspended...    In fact, of the balls that they measured from the Colts, 3/4 were also under-inflated, but for some reason they stopped measuring there.  *Today in, 'Made Up Facts That Sound Real Because They Were Said As Fact.'*   I get your point for sure. I think it was the absolute perfect storm for him. There was a definite quiet boiling of public ire at the NFL for their treatment (or lack thereof) of players with records of domestic violence. Then Ray Rice in the elevator happened, with the added bonus of the smoking gun in the form of a video. That visceral evidence blows it out of the water. Can you imagine if tape surfaced of Mike Vick killing dogs? Or of Greg Hardy beating the hell out of a series of women? They'd have never set foot within a country mile of an NFL city. Ever. They'd have been burned at the stake. People don't forget when they see the evidence.   The NFL completely underestimated this growing resentment and media interest in the Ray Rice case. They tried to cover up and give a weak pass to protect their brand and keep pretending they're a nice company with nice people. Then the public flipped out and the NFL had to conjure up "new evidence" that led them to suspend Rice indefinitely to appear tough on DV.    [ya sure?](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000430302/article/adrian-peterson-suspended-without-pay-for-rest-of-14)   Yep, you're right, thanks for clarifying!    Well I guess that's just not as catchy as "murderer"   This is about the 100th time I've seen this. This photo is a disgrace. Lewis: acquitted (make your jokes). Mayweather convicted and served jail time and absolutely everyone agrees he's a piece of shit. Roethlisberger: acquitted (make your jokes). Ray Rice: suspended from NFL indefinitely and still remains out of league. AP suspended last year for remainder of season.   They all were either acquitted in trial or depositions, or served far worse punishments than anything Brady will get. And no one thinks these are comparable moral actions. Just stop with this crap.    edit: thank you /u/Ravenman2423 and anonymous gilder for the gold.   "Cool"   "Who are you quoting?"   Not sure if it's because you don't like euro games or heavier games based on your collection, but if you're looking to fill that void, I'd go with a euro. Keyflower and Caverna are fantastic. Terra Mystica is my all time favorite game, especially if you're looking for heavier. For worker placement, I'd look at Manhattan Project, Stone Age, Lords of Waterdeep or Spyrium. The game of the week right now is Bruges and that is immensely fun. Pretty easy to get into and a ton of depth/replayability.

If you suck and take a ton of practice swings, walk slow, switch clubs, and drag the round down, then we don't want to play with you...same as if you were a good golfer (it just gets exaggerated when you're bad).

       Another backwards left-wing idiot reactionary afraid of change, efficiency, and competition.    Gawker and their whole network are garbage, especially Jezebel. Only Jalopnik, which is part of the Gawker network, is the exception to that rule. I automatically assume that anyone from my facebook friends list that likes Gawker's or Jezebel's facebook page or links to an article of theirs is an automatic left-wing idiot.    Good to see you understand how every publication can be biased. Do you also apply such logic to Gawker, Jezebel, The Guardian and MSNBC or do you let them slide because their biases are also your biases.    This very true. What is interesting about this study is that nearly every SJW would fit this type of pattern of behavior as many of them are losers in life and often lash out as a result because someone that they don't like or are prejudiced against is getting ahead of them in life. Many women I have observed that exhibit this type of aggressive behavior also turned out to be losers in life. This study won't just apply to men. I think the more likely explanation is the crabs in a bucket explanation. Losers tend to want to pull other people down especially if the person happens to be different than them or if they are prejudiced against that group.   	6

Despite the fact that we have a laughably high incarceration rate attempts to change that in the best way possible, with social welfare and a focus on rehabilitation, are seen as unnecessary 'handouts'.   I mean isn't a prison sentence for all intents and purposes just a 'hand out' that only goes to criminals?  Resources that could theoretically go to improving other parts of society are instead allocated to prisons to feed, house, guard, etc criminals. You can't even expect a return on these investments because our current prison system is more about punishment than rehabilitation.

I believe harringtonine's treatment is inapplicable to prokaryotes however is this correct? Please correct me if I'm wrong but I think cycloheximide can produce the same effects in eukaryotes as well. Unfortunately the specific reason I am trying to analyze prokaryotes is the lack of this type of treatment which makes looking at true start codons much harder.  Upon the advice of a much more knowledgeable colleague of mine, I have will begin looking in to Markov chain models and HMM in specific as well. Would you happen to have any insight of the applicability of these algorithms?    I am doing research into using ribosome profiling data to identify ORFs and coding regions in a genome, ideally with no annotation, just the ribosome profiling data and the genome sequence. Differentiation density data this is noise from actual data is proving very difficult.  Because I will be looking at millions of data points an efficient algorithm that takes as little processing resources as possible is also necessary. Here are some visualizations of the data distribution. What I want to do is to be able to identify the relevant information from the rest of the data by only looking at red shown in read in a high resolution ideally within 1-3 nts. The scale for these photos varies, but is included in the final photo  [Areas to be differentiated are marked with green boxes](http://i.imgur.com/kVkz3gB.png) Although there is a high degree of variability between the values corresponding to the reference data in blue, the general trend is that much higher values are seen in this area compared to the noisy portions  [A close up view of the point of transition from noise to data](http://i.imgur.com/6JTVds4.png).

It works but only somewhat. I was wondering if anyone could give advice me on what a good algorithm design for doing this would be or tell me where to look to figure it out myself. I have a very limited DSP background , 4 or 5 years ago I took a single DSP class in college but that's about it so I really don't even know where to start right researching this kind of thing right now.   Yeah that is the problem. This data is actually ribosome density data for E. Coli genome. It is a direct link at where ribosomes are bound on a genome, meaning where transcription is occurring or where DNA is actively being turn into proteins. Prior to this method called ribo-seq or ribosome profiling, we have never had a direct look at the transcription process, only indirect looks or using computing algorithms to kind of try to predict where ribosomes are likely to be. It is very promising.   No one currently understand exactly what produces the "noise" and the "data" although there are some theories. I am doing research trying to decipher this as it would prove very beneficial in sequencing genomes and gene expression.

Thank you for this, that is incredible. It is so close in so many ways, the thinking seems so modern, almost how I would think back on earlier civilizations/tribal cultures. Truly shows that I am really no different than those born in these ancient civilizations, just born a bit later with better access to education   What an eloquent explanation of the feelings I could not put into words about Freakonomics. As a scientist reading that book, I found myself more often than not simply thinking 'this is not sufficient evidence to draw these conclusions' at many of their claims.   This is an in-depth, evidence based, rebuttal to one of these claims with a very concrete and reasonable conclusion.   By ancient civilizations I guess I am referring to Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and even back to the earliest Mesopotamian civilizations. I am by no means very well versed in historical academic terms so please excuse any mistake I make of that nature.  I know religion was probably the most ubiquitous source of explanations for the origins of humanity in these days, but I am sure learned men in these civilizations investigated or at least thought about these origins in a more scientific sense. Basically I am asking where did this types of people believe humanity came from. Did they know or suspect humanity's tribal origins? Were they able to make the connections necessary connecting cave paintings or other historical remnants to the true origin of the human race?    Yep.

Thank you, I really tried to make sure any claims I made were either verifiable or labelled as speculation based on my limited knowledge. This question appeared as the very first question in the entire thread to me and was also among the few top questions lacking any meaningful response. It might not be a straightforward or definitive answer but isn't this the case with a lot of questions most worth asking?   A sample size of 1 is simply not sufficient to draw any of these conclusions with the certainty you are stating.   I mean I see the sense in it definitely but I feel most people don't make a distinction between aerosolized and airborne and would just consider both varying degrees of airborne. Like if I didn't have a knowledge of infectious disease terminology I would definitely think not airborne means only direct contact like touching is a risk, when in reality indirect contact within 3 feet is high risk.    Thanks, really good points. I did some digging and really couldn't find any other papers which take a look at when fever begins relative to the infection timeline do you have any recommendations? We really are in the wild west here, West Africa is not conducive to drawing conclusions using the scientific method and there are so just many unknowns. Really reinforces that old adage 'the more you know the more you realize how just much you don't know' for you.   Yeah I do work in bioinformatics and I don't sequence viral genomes specifically but do work on them often. Honestly I got involved as an undergrad, my degree was Biomedical Engineering and things just kind of fell into place. I was trying to find some research opportunities during a relatively light semester and sent this professor, who is now the lead researcher, an email expressing interest in gene sequencing. Surprisingly he got back to me on my first email, usually you have to be assertive and kind of force your way in for these things and even then it will probably not end in anything. I met with him and somehow was able to convince him despite the fact I had no experience with bioinformatics and hadn't  and wasn't going to be able to take his class on the subject that I'd be able to learn and help the team. It really was more luck than anything that I get to work on stuff like this but I enjoy it a lot.   In the 2000  2001 Ebola outbreak in Gulu, Uganda, one EVD patient had no direct exposure to another known EVD patient; this patient slept with a blanket that had been used by another patient who died of EVD  Source: http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/transmission/human-transmission.html   Yep I figured, really wanted that whole sentence to stay a single thought but I kept thinking of more things I wanted to say and didn't have the heart to end the sentence before it got out of hand.    Ha I do what I can.   While I do agree completely with this, I'm gonna go ahead and play devil's advocate for a seconds to get your opinion on something.  It is undoubtedly true that being asymptomatic means there is such a small chance of transmission that it can be basically considered zero for most purposes.  The hard part is defining what separates the "asymptomatic" period from being symptomatic especially from person to person. According to a WHO report from September 12.9% of confirmed or suspected ebola patients were not showing a fever despite presenting other symptoms leading to this diagnosis and it is possible these people without a fever have the same viral load and transmission potential as someone on the same time frame who does show a fever. On top of that,  becoming symptomatic is not a binary thing where 1 minute you are fine and the next you have a fever of 100.4F but instead a gradual change over the course of 12-24 hours. I'm going off memory here so correct me if I'm wrong but I believe symptoms begin when that first lymphocyte lyses and significant levels of the virus start to enter the blood stream. In reality you won't realize you are symptomatic exactly at this time because the symptoms are still so minor there is no practical way yet to check for them. This creates a grey area from the time when the virus first really enters the blood stream to the time you recognize the symptoms. As far as I know we cannot quantify the actual potential for transmission in this grey area but theoretically it is now non-zero.   There is a balance that must be found between reasonable levels of precautions to ensure public safety and being so cautious that the treatment of possible people with possible exposure is disrespectful, inconvenient and even insulting. This is especially the case for these doctors and nurses on the front lines of W Africa who deserve to be hailed as heroes coming home from war and not pariahs risking national security. Right now it seems that based on the limited evidence we have, the mandatory quarantine falls on the excessive side of the spectrum but all it takes is one person to fall in that 12.9% that don't present fever immediately or for one of these potentially non zero transmission risks to actually occur. Treating these HCW as heroes like they deserve is not mutually exclusive with a mandatory quarantine and although I understand the fact that something like this would dissuade doctors and nurses from volunteering in West Africa I am not entirely convinced convenience is a valid reason not to eliminate the potential risk that something occurs in an unexpected manner, even if the risk of this actually is very slim. The scientific community is still mostly in the introduction phase for this disease relative to our knowledge about other well studied diseases. There are just so many known unknowns and unknown unknowns with ebola which could potentially confound things, should we not err on the side of caution until we have a bit more in depth knowledge of the epidemiology of this outbreak and can do a little bit better than extrapolate things from  previous outbreaks and piece together data acquired in an environment which is not conducive to the scientific method? The rigorously investigations which would occur in a lab are simply not possible in West Africa right now so any conclusions from this data should be taken with a grain of salt. In addition, very very few labs have the ability to work with BSL4 pathogens and even these labs that can may not be able to get samples of Ebola in a timely manner due to various governmental constraints. In my opinion it is simply not possible right now tough to figure things out with certainty and with ebola certainty is a requirement, for me at least . What is your thought process in defining this balance of caution and reason and are there any shortcomings to your definition that you had to unfortunately accept which should still be kept in mind? There have been no infections in the US from indirect exposure or even direct exposure outside of a single patient being dealt with by unprepared staff but what how many infected people would it take for one of these indirect exposure transmissions to actually occur?   Note: This was more of a thought experiment than anything and not indicative of my actual opinion of these event but these questions are still definitely valid and not without merit.   So looks like drinking a shitload of alcohol will end up hurting your ability to fight off the infection more than it hurts the virus ability to infect but it looks like "moderate" alcohol consumption may improve your immune response. No clue why and I honestly was surprised to find this study but it seems to be true with monkeys and small pox at least.   http://www.infection-research.de/news/view/detail/item-1/study_moderate_alcohol_consumption_boosts_bodys_immune_system/   Ha my second ebola related gilding this month, thank you! Really I'm just glad help as I know not everyone has the level of scientific literacy my education afforded me nor are they nerdy enough to spend their free time reading peer reviewed literature about ebola. Personally the fact this little emotionless molecular machine can outsmart our immune system and bodies with ease despite almost all of our scientific advances and progress to replicate itself with a ruthless efficiently so intense that you can't handle it and will probably die within 14-21 days if you don't have the smartest and most knowledgeable doctors in the world treating you no holds barred is pretty crazy.   I'll do my best, I'm not an Ebola expert but I am a scientist who works in sequencing of viral genomes and also have a morbid fascination with the disease. The head researcher in my lab was hired by the CDC in August(lab is in Atlanta) specifically to work on sequencing this current ebola outbreak and since I see him almost every day, I've learned a lot talking to him about his work and also have been trying to keep up with all current peer reviewed literature about ebola I can.  First of all, I really don't think anyone in the world knows enough about ebola to provide any concretes answers to this question. I would think anything you hear is not going to be more than speculation or an educated guess.  Ebola is a BSL4 pathogen, basically meaning you need crazy elaborate PPE, labs and decontamination facilities to study it. On top of that before this current outbreak ebola was not seen as something that necessarily warranted intensive study by more than 1 or 2 research teams. In every single of the previous 10-15 outbreaks occurring from 1976-2012, the disease killed so quickly and ruthlessly that it burnt itself out before making it out of rural villages or infecting more than 20-200 people. This lead to a assumption that this was just the normal life cycle of the disease and because of it's high mortality rate and low infectivity it would never become pandemic. Because of both of the difficulty studying BSL4 pathogens and the relatively low level of interest in studying the disease,  there is a lot to be desired in our current understand of ebola which is currently being learned on the fly. For example there is no definite scientific consensus on things like exactly how long the virus can "live" outside the body and or how substantial the risk of asymptomatic transmission is.   What we do know is this, Ebola is relatively fragile as a pathogen. It is easily denatured by bleach and ethanol meaning it loses the ability to cause infections by simply spraying an infected surface down with bleach or using 60-70% ethanol hand sanitizer. On the other hand, Ebola is incredibly infectious and can achieve transmission when as little as 1-10 viral particles come in contact with your eyes, nose or mouth. Since a single drop of blood from someone in the later stages of the disease contains trillions of these particles, it is very hard to denature every single one of these particles every single time and one misstep can result in transmission.   Above were the facts, the rest of this is going to be very much speculation but I'll do my best to answer your question about cold weather and the spread. I would say it is possible that ebola could spread easier during the winter due to a couple of things. The biggest reason would be the ability of the virus to remain "alive" outside the human body for longer periods of time in cooler weather. Colder temperatures means slower chemical reactions all around which means the lipid membrane and RNA of the virus would take longer to breakdown in these non biological conditions outside of a living host. I believe the best guess for how long ebola can live outside the body ranges from a couple hours at room temperature and in the sun to weeks when it is in a cool dark area. Basically, the risk of transmission through indirect contact MAY increase slightly in the winter because the viral particles would not breakdown and become inert quite so quickly but quantifying this risk is all but impossible right now, at least given the knowledge I have.   A couple other things crossed my mind which might have a small effect on the spread such as the fact that the slower rate of chemical reactions in colder weather may have an effect on the effectiveness in denaturing the virus particle with bleach or ethanol and make it so more viral particles survive at the same level of exposure in a lower temperature. This would improve possibility of coming into contact with those 1-10 virions which are necessary to begin an infection which is never a good thing. The longer nights and shorter days in the winter could also influence how long the virus can survive outside the body as light contributes to the reactions which denature the molecules as well. This would be similar in effects to the lower temperatures I described above. Finally, the fact that in the winter people generally try to stay out of the cold and may be inside more often than in summer means more people in confined spaces for long periods of time. This would give the virus an improved environment for transmission and increased infectivity compared to warmer periods of the year. I am not sure but I bet these are some of these same factors contribute to the increased spread of gastroenteritis originally mentioned. Hopefully someone who knows more than I do can come along and tell me what I got wrong or what I failed to mention because I'm sure I missed a lot.   Now we are getting into the semantics of the word airborne. In science, this is considered "aeresolized" transmission and is distinct from "airborne" transmission. In aeresolized transmission the virions(virus particles) must remain suspended in droplets of some kind, such as mucus or saliva, in order to actually achieve transmission. So if you cough up some mucus, tiny droplets can be small enough to kind of float through the air before settling down but these droplets but they will never travel more than a couple feet at most. In airborne transmission, the virus has adapted to be able to "live" when it isn't suspended in bodily fluids and this makes it much more infectious. The viral residue from evaporated droplets are much more lightweight than their aersolized counterparts and behave similar to a speck of dust able to float or hang in the air and be blown around in the wind giving it a much longer effective range for transmission.  I agree that this distinction is confusing and misleading for people who don't know the scientific definitions and the media should make more of an attempt to translate the scientific consensus for Ebola transmission into words the public can readily understand as if you don't know the science behind all of this, hearing ebola isn't airborne but can be transferred through the air just doesn't make any sense.   I don't think that exactly what he is saying. We are talking about asymptomatic transmission not the potential for humans as asymptomatic disease carriers. This may just be semantics but asymptomatic reservoirs to me implies someone who is infected with Ebola and can transmit it to other people but for whatever reason also does not show any of the normal pathological effects of the virus, someone like Typhoid Mary for example. I am skeptical that this is possible too, but asymptomatic transmission is indisputable possible and the reason the rule of thumb is that you aren't infectious before you show symptoms is because the risk of transmission is so low that the probably is almost irrelevant. I would be interested to see some confirmed cases of asymptomatic transmission, especially for the strain of ebola that makes up this outbreak but due to the fact that displaying symptoms is not a binary thing where one minute you are completely fine the next you have a 101.5 fever I'm sure there are some transmissions which fit the criteria for occurring during the asymptomatic stage.   I don't understand what you mean by "statistically always" with regards to fever first. This is not the case, according to [this study](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-1012-ebola-fever-20141012-story.html#page=1) by the WHO in September, 12.9% of people in West Africa "confirmed or suspected" of having Ebola did not present a fever at all but still showed other symptoms which led to the suspicion they had Ebola.  This is very much NOT "statisically always" and although I don't entirely disagree with your point I just wanted to point that out.    What is your opinion on what seems to be a substantial decline in new cases of Ebola in Liberia in the past few weeks? Although I had and still do have my reservations about the accuracy of these statistics, it really is starting to seem like something has changed for the better in Liberia. With reports like the one released yesterday by MSF stating that 2/3 of the beds in the ETUs they operate are currently empty along with the WHO's general optimism that this drop in reported cases is actually representative of the situation in Liberia and not just due to case reporting errors something has definitely improved in Liberia. If I remember correctly, both the total number of Ebola cases and the total number of deaths reported by the WHO actually dropped from last week's report to the most recent one which was especially surprising given these numbers were not the number of new cases per week but the overall number of ebola cases, this drop was apparently due to case reclassification and clerical errors which outnumbered the total number of new cases last week.  First of all, do you guys share this same kind of kind of tentative optimism shown by MSF and the WHO with regards to the recent reports from Liberia? Everything in Liberia right now seems to point to the fact that some recent change, perhaps an increased public awareness about Ebola, a change in cultural practices or an increased international response in fighting Ebola is working to fight the spread of this disease and this suggests that it is still not too late to contain and control the epidemic in West Africa. Do you have any insights as to what specifically could be causing this drop in new cases in Liberia and what can be done to ensure these trends continue? Any thoughts on what the top priorities of the international community should be to in order to see this same reassuring case drop in Sierra Leone and Guinea and to make sure that no other countries see any large scale outbreaks? It seems to me that the situation has started looking substantially better and much more under control in the past 2 or 3 weeks as compared to 1-2 months ago, here's to hoping this is actually the case and that this continues.   Don't forget about my buddy lon Muske   I didn't realize this until I googled it but this is Mos Def being force fed Guantanamo style   Let me tell you about my time with DMT and the puppet master. My friends and I had just gotten some DMT and this was probably only the 2nd or 3rd time I had ever done it. We were passing the Volcano filled with them orange crystals and it finally got to my turn. I inhaled as much as I could and held it for as long as I could. We were all sitting in a single room, probably like 4 or 5 people on 2 separate couches. Eventually, I look up and see this malevolent, elf/troll like creature up in the top corner of the room. I didn't think about what the fuck was going on or what I was seeing, this was the puppetmaster it was perfectly obvious at the time and I didn't really see any other way to interpret it. I never thoguht about what to call him, this name just came to me somehow and in retrospect its incredibly fucking apt for what I saw. There were "strings" or something like strings going from this being to every other fucking person in the room except me. Whenever anyone else would move the puppet master would move their strings, it was like the puppetmaster was controlling them, puppeterring them and I could see this all happen. It occurred to me that everyone else in the universe, except for me, is all the same being, the same entity, all controlled by this omniscient fucker I was seeing right in front of me. After thinking this, I remember "him" looking down at me and just smiling. Fuck that fucked with my mind. Took me probably 15 minutes after I came down to compose my thoughts before I actually told any of my friends what I saw. For all I know, you are just some other incarnation being controlled by the puppetmaster.   TLDR: DMT is the shit.   I feel no matter what he says he must still have some hope, consciously or subconsciously in the back of his mind that thing might just work out for them.   There's also the fact that since so few are being treated for ebola in the US, all of the current are getting treated by the brightest, best equipped and with very little limits on the resources available to keep them alive. Only Duncan was treated in what can be considered a normal run of the mill hospital rather than someplace like Emory or NIH which are literally the best hospitals in the world. All of this could also play a factor in the observed mortality rate in the US currently. If there were a major outbreak in the US, I believe the mortality rate would be somewhere in between what it is in West Africa currently and the 11% we see in the US currently.   Yep, if you read that wikipedia article in it's entirety, RIDL is mentioned in there along with the limitation that 5% of the insects which should not mature end up actually maturing.   It's like ebola, if you can get that R0 below 1 for each individual of the species, they will die out eventually even if it takes years.  Probably not correct terminology but whatever.   I lived in a fraternity house which got infested. Terrible decision moving in there that semester, the bed bugs were by far worse than the fact that people would drink and blast music until 5 am every night and I was sleeping over the house speakers.   The worse is how paranoid they cause you to be. Whenever I was sleeping in my bed which I knew was infested, I could never tell if they were actually crawling on me or I was just imagining it and that would keep me awake at night. Terrible experience...   Good point, sort of like close encounters of the third kind I guess? This is really interesting to think about. I'm really hoping we encounter extraterrestrial life at some point in my life time. I have a very strong biochemical background so I would looove to take at look at the biochemistry of ET life.    I'm worried that if we do in fact encounter an an alien civilization communication with them will be nearly impossible. Think about it, we can barely communicate with our closest evolutionary relative, apes. How could we possibly communicate when there is no evolutionary overlap at all and we have no common ancestors.    Fair warning your reddit username is now known to all 07831   Fuck you Ryan you don't deserve to watch the greatness that is lost seasons 1-(maybe)4...   I really think changing the post tagging system would be benefit the entire community. There should be two main categories, speculative and non-speculative, and under these categories there should be tags such as the current ones we have now, but also tags for news articles, etc. A tag on every post(not reply but post which would show up on the subreddit front page) should be mandatory, at the very least discriminating between speculation and non-speculation but ideally for higher levels of discrimination between news articles, etc. than that.  You should also allow a user tagging system like the one in /r/science or /r/askscience which tags knowledgeable with their relevant criteria so all users on this subreddit can easily see if someone who knows their shit is posting this or if its just an "armchair epidemiologist".   I have been fairly active on this subreddit and have a strong scientific background, I am a scientist with a Biomedical Engineering degree and I work in a genetics lab in Atlanta where the lead researcher was hired in August by the CDC to work on the sequencing of the ebola outbreak. He works at the CDC full time 4-5 days a week but stops by our lab after 5pm so I see him still almost every day. I have a morbid fascination with Ebola, have been keeping up with the scientific literature and also have a behind the scenes view of how things work with the CDC. I would love to help out this community in any way I can, and have been trying to do such. Let me know if there is anything else in your opinion I can be doing to improve the community as a whole.   All you need is 3 months tops. Have some ghost writer start doing it immediately and get it out there ASAP, I would say with a focus of the human aspect of treatment in W Africa instead of coming back to the US. There doesn't seem to be many of books on this topic out there. She should use here platform to tell the true human story over there, not some bullshit about her human rights over here. I don't expect that out of this woman unfortunetly she seems like she 's enjoying her 15 mins of fame and doing her damnedest to be a martyr.    Just out of curiosity if she couldn't pay a ghost writer immediately, would they work on contingency or for a share of the book profits? Anyone know?   Not a scientific source obviously, but I didn't want to sift through all the peer reviewed articles I've been reading on Ebola but a simple ebola 10 millions years search on google produced this. http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/10/27/ebola-may-have-existed-over-20-million-years-ago-scientists-find/  Looks like it was 20 million years. I'm sure you can find the scientific journal article from that news article     This is just semi educated speculation but it is possible there has been evolutionary pressure for increased resistance to Ebola but this is only in West Africa. This family of viruses has been around for 10 million years in that area, infecting our ancestors or their evolutionary relatives. Would it not be possible that this results in an increased ability for the immune response and for the body to fight off these disease in these regions?   Also could you provide sources for that study you mentioned and any relevant credentials you have that would lend credence to the accuracy of your speculations you refer to as estimates? If you look through my post history, you can find my credentials relatively easily.   Yep, I'm wondering if the CDC has this information. I have a colleague, the lead of my research team, who was hired in August by the CDC for work on Ebola, specifically the genetic sequencing and epidemiological spread of it. I see him almost every day(the research lab is in Atlanta). I figure it can't hurt to ask if his is privy to this information. I'll update you on any info I find out if you'd like. This is some very interesting information to me   Would you be willing or able to provide statistics for infections across all MSF treatment centers in that time frame?  I would look into it myself but I don't have the time currently  Edit: Must have skimmed your post sorry. It seems other information isn't publicly available at this time?   A sample size of 300 will often not give statistical significance when compared to a sample size of say 3000 or 10000, which we could see in the coming months. I think any extrapolation based on this 1/300 number is not statistically sound and is basically just a guess.  Edit: Not to mention you choose only one of the many Ebola treatment centers out of the many that are currently operating. This begs the question, did you choose which ETH to base your statisitics off to further your point? Genuinely curious I'm not trying to insult you or anything.   Very good point. I didn't even think about the innate corruption in African governments   Don't you think money be a good incentive for cooperation? If they forego their current ingrained cultural transitions maybe they should get a monetary reward for that. Not the best plan but I cannot think of any others.   Hahaha just looked at this for this first time on mobile... wow   Haha this should have been at the top. Another one you shoulda posted  TLDR: Took acid and back flopped off a 25 foot cliff and may have started coughing up blood. Continued tripping for about 8-10 hours in terrible pain.

 Here's the challenge link (though my Girlfriend and I have upgraded it to include Fairy and one of each generation, so it's more like a 38 day challenge now) - https://www.pinterest.com/pin/440367669790326803/  Here's Day #2 - My favourite Pokemon (Umbreon). Not as happy with this one as the first day, kinda wish they'd left you favourite pokemon of all time until last, but hey ho. A little bit dis-proportioned. http://imgur.com/k70X5UE   Hi Matthew, big fan!  Just about to start Six Sacred Stones- absolutely loved Seven Ancient Wonders. How did you come up with the hanging gardens idea? I've seen some ancient wonder theories before, but never a literal hanging garden like that! Was there a source for that inspiration or just an idea that popped into your head?  Are you signing anywhere in Sydney soon? I'm on a working holiday so would love to catch you before I move on!  Cheers!   Guys- give her body the time of day.  You like her curves? Stroke/tickle/lick them. You like her neck? Nibble it. You like any other part of her that isn't her sexual organs? Pay attention to it!  Spend the time appreciating her body in its entirety, and you'll be rewarded a lot better than when you dive straight in (pun semi-intended (and that one)).  The number of guy friends I have (I'm also a guy) that have told me they go straight for the gold...I can't help but ask why!?  Also, when you do get down there, if you use your senses to be aware of your partner, you can tell what's good and what's not. Go slow, be rhythmic and gentle (unless otherwise directed) and pay attention to it all (again) - there's more than just a clit down there. Ya know what I'm sayin'!   You, my dear, win at being thrifty. Kudos. *doffs hat*   Anyone happen to have these and willing to share? I say eBook as I'm travelling, and can only really read on my iPhone at the moment!  Would love to have them to be able to read one after the other!   Should add this in shouldn't I...Okay, consider it unofficially added.   Thanks! :)   Here's the challenge link; https://www.pinterest.com/pin/440367669790326803/  Here's Day #1 - Myself as a Pokemon Trainer  http://imgur.com/tkTlSuD   I'm not looking for anyone to do my work for me- I never use anyone's ideas as they are, I always twist them (even if it's only slightly) to make them my own. I'm really just looking for suggestions to spark off my own ideas (it's how I come up with ideas best).  Thanks for your suggestions though I'll try that and do some digging!  P.s. It's a story (though as I said the story won't be about what happened to the villain)   He won't bond to a bird.  Birds don't like him- he's "too loud" remember?  It was the same with Burrich- both of them let someone else manage the Hawks at Buck Keep because they got agitated around him.  There were a couple of other instances, even a piece about it in Fools Assassin, but I forget the exact words.   I tip my hat to you. You have pretty much summed up my exact theory (I finished the book yesterday- I know, I know, latecomer), on those two by-blows.  Also, how much do we want Fitz to scream in Shuns face exactly who he is, what he's done for the family, country and world, and why she should STFU and stop being such a spoiled, self-important brat? :)  Further note- wasn't Lant seen dead by Bee as she observed the raiders?      This question popped into my mind after reading about the guy who had to have his islocated hip popped back into the joint, only to have his ball literally popped (it had somehow migrated there in the car crash he was in) when the bone snapped back into place.  So, why does it hurt so much, and why does it hurt in the kidney area?   Hey guys, some great stuff for me to think about so far, to address your points;  -What I have so far on him; He's an illusionist, he doesn't like showing his true self or exposing himself so often either uses a complete illusion of himself (or how he wishes to be perceived) or a partial-illusion on one of his followers to make it look like "him". He likes to use misdirection - making someone look one way whilst he or his followers go/do something in another. I'm not sure whether he's scared of the vulnerability, has low self-worth or what the reason is for this yet.  I'd like to think he's a good leader, and is nice or at least respectful to his followers/workers.  Remember though guys, this is all background/pre-story the stuff that happens to the "villain" to make him the way he is, so it's NOT the story that will be being told and therefore will not make him look like a victim from having all these things happen to him. I just like to understand the reason behind his motivations - it helps me write better.  EDITED: Removed part about anti-villain; have decided I want him to see EVERYONE else as unworthy, and wants to eliminate all but two of every race so that he can start the world anew. The question I need now is WHY he see's everyone else as unworthy - what made him believe he's special and everyone else isn't?  Note: This doesn't change his leadership status - he still understands that to get results you need to be a good leader, so he just pretends to care to make his underlings follow him and seem like a good leader.      I'm looking to set up a series of events that shaped my antagonist the way he is, can any of you suggest bad things to happen to him along the way? (This all takes place before the story, but it shapes who he is, so I need to know - I've got a couple of ideas, like his parents are killed in front of him when he's quite young, he's denied the chance to get revenge, he's belittled and outcast regularly everywhere he goes, but any and all suggestions are good - even if they're not used it'll give me fuel to think!)  Thanks   I'd like her to have a terminator-esque glow in one eye, almost like a lense is there instead of the eyeball a couple of wires coming out of her chin/cheeks (maybe change her hair into wires/cables too?) and a couple of tiny tools extending from her fingertips.  A picture for inspiration; https://www.google.com.au/search?q=servitor+40k rlz=1C1PRFC_enGB603GB603 espv=2 biw=1024 bih=509 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=sMvdVIeTNIXdmAWhzoHgAw ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ#imgdii=_ imgrc=FQw12CJO_Vb-zM%253A%3B9cDF8XC0Yj8juM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fvignette2.wikia.nocookie.net%252Fwarhammer40k%252Fimages%252F4%252F49%252FSamech_Redemption_Servitor.jpg%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20120707010129%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwarhammer40k.wikia.com%252Fwiki%252FSamech_Redemption_Servitor%3B374%3B557  If anyone can go further and add some sort of matrix-like symbol text that looks like its inside her "lense" eye that'd be even better.  Here's my friend's picture; http://imgur.com/dAQXEFa  Thanks to anyone who tries!   I think the natural one is better, but thank-you so much! That's really great work :) So happy!   Hi guys, there isn't any special reason behind this request; I just really love the simplicity of this sign and symbol. I went there early on in my backpacking trip, with a bunch of great friends, and it was an awesome memory.  I love the sign, but it's hard to look at it properly due to the shadows and smudges on the metal - any chance someone could clean it up for me and brighten those shady areas so it looks clean and naturally (evenly) bright?  Here's the picture; http://imgur.com/ruumOpT   Males of Reddit, what do you do with your armpit hair? Leave it to grow wildly? Trim it? Style it? Shave it off completely?  Women of Reddit (and those who like Men also), what are your preferences on Men's armpit hair?      ^ This awesome person delivered.   Only just discovered the existence of this book online, and really want to read it - read the first few pages on Amazon's "look inside me" feature, and now can't wait to get my hands on it!  Anyone able to help me out?  EDIT: Unfortunately I'm travelling at the moment, so wouldn't be able to offer any other books in exchange right now, so it'd have to be an act of generosity. Though I am willing to keep the generous soul's details to provide them with a list of my books up for offer when I do eventually return home :)   Hey all,  I need a convincing way to get two characters to meet...one [M] is a rogue/thief type character, running away from the authorities to try and escape the city, and the other [F] is a mage with (at this point) no interest in him (or knowledge about him). I want something that would mean she'd go with him, but isn't romantically baesd (they don't get together).  Thks forany ideas!   Just to clarify, I don't want NSFW- I want her breasts to be covered, though shoulders/upper chest can be bared to show the markings.    Hey guys, I'm looking for a concept image of a fantasy character that I want to write about.  I'd like the energy/magic tattoos from the first image combined with the weapon types of the second, though I'd like it to be female please. Feel free to experiment with her looks/hair.  Here are the two images;  http://imgur.com/sjM2jdq,MhJ9REO  Thanks to any and all who try, and I'm open to drawings/paintings/graphic art, whatever gets the concept together!   Thanks guys.   Basically like Google Translate, where you can put in an English (or other language) word, but it shows ALL (or at least a lot) of languages' translated words?         That's my point - the government shut down the Forensic Science Service in the middle of my second year of university, meaning that suddenly all the Forensic work was private, and there are a load of Forensic-qualified and experienced people out there, more experienced and qualified than me, without jobs, and not enough jobs to go around. So I'm looking for other options.   With a Forensic Science degree (when there aren't a lot of Forensic Science jobs going thanks to the UK government), what are other options? Would like to consider everything. Currently backpacking in Australia.   Are you in the US or Australia?   Money can be raised though, right? With investments from companies? (Though I understand that they're limited to a certain value)   That's...actually a pretty good rule of thumb. Court the people, as it were. Nice idea.   If I was ever going to run for any kind of politics, I'd run with my own politics, whether or not that was "the party's" politics. If that meant I didn't get whatever gig I was going for, then so be it, but I wouldn't want to compromise on my own beliefs like we see a lot of the big politicians do.   If, for example, you wanted to aim at the big office at 10 Downing Street, what route would you need to take?   I'm a backpacker, so any good books kindly gifted would be very happily received.  I tend to try anything, but my chosen genres are generally sci-fi and fantasy, though I do read crime/thriller books on occasion. For example, my favourite books are Lord of the Rings, the Inheritance Cycle, His Dark Materials, and Robin Hobb's Fitz/Fool series. I always enjoy James Patterson, and other, similar, crime authors.  FYI I'm in NSW, Sydney at the moment, but in three weeks time I'll be in rural NSW for a week, then travelling northwards!   Back in MY day there was no such thing as Pokemon, Internet, Computers, Mobiles, Apps, DVD/Blu-Ray, and the only 3D we had was pictures in a comic book that you looked at with glasses that had one red lense and one blue.   This'd make a great reaction gif with the right precursor material.      We used to wrestle a lot when we were younger- I picked him up around the waist to throw him and down and in my enthusiasm lifted him up so he hit his head against the lightbulb (with considerable force).  It was on, and bits of glass shot everywhere!   	42
 He quit on his own.. He left the show cause it was to much for him.  I think season 7,8,9 were Larry free.   I used windex / glass cleaner on mine and it cleaned it all up   Love his reviews.  I have the moto and still love it.   Everyone I know that has a smartwarch always comments on how much they prefer the 360 and wish they bought one of these instead.. (They all have either a Samsung or Sony)   It had its merits, but compared to the rest of the seasons, the finale was mediocre at best.  They invited Larry David back to help write the last episode, maybe that was the ingredient that ruined it.   Or that Hank isn't drinking Alamo   Mine worked with no side loading or anything, best of all it works for my Nexus 6 and my iPhone at the same time!!   There is soot under my boys fingers!!   I think even Arnie knew this would be posted at some stage.   Hey Cotton, come meet Hanks new neighbour, he's Japanese....   /r/trashyboners   Your username.. "Its pronounced Khan, right?"   I have every nexus device (except the 10) and currently have an iPhone 6 and an iPad Air 2 (both work), the Nexus 6 is still phone I prefer to use (just edges out the iPhone 6) and the Nexus 9 is always my goto Tablet (Massively wins against the iPad).  You will love the Nexus 9.     That's ok.. Kickass.to is the way to go these days.   I kind of figured as much, although the more I read it, the more my head hurt.   Cats are shit and they suck.   The dark web is pretty much dead, it's slow and pointless.  Obviously their are probably some dirt bags out there looking at shit they shouldn't be.  What are you trying to find on there? The dark web isn't that safe environment it once was, where you could find interesting leaks and conspiracies etc, its now just like using the web back in the dial up days before google existed.   I'm stuck trying the figure out what you're asking, and I'm male.   Keep in mind, 99% of people will jump online and bitch and moan about how bad their device is, no one goes onto forums to start a new post of "I bought a Nexus 9 and it works fine"  A lot of us haven't had any issues at all, knock on wood, mine has been brilliant and stable since day one, and I was an early adopter.   That's what pissed me off the most about her!   That part was voiced and written perfectly.    That was the best relationship, he always took little stabs at her, you don't know if she was ignorant, or purposely ignorant to them.   Competition to a brilliant already existent,  free service?   Peggy aggravates me so damn much!  You either love her or hate her.    Other way around for me, I never had issues on 5.0.2, the upgrade to 5.1.1 has made it a touch snappier if anything   I received 5.1.1 through Google as an OTA update..  Nothing to write home about. My N9 works the same as it did before   Yup.. this is in 5.1, or am I getting my 2 phones confused? (I have an iphone 6 as a work phone)   You were unlucky.   Just install the update again. As a precaution, enable OEM unlock   Well written mate,   The quick reply from the notification is already there as a part of 5.1   I've seen this so many times, but never seen the video.. Is there a clip of this?   All of these are great inclusions, but not something I see as being a milestone build like 6.0..  I think Android M will be 5.2 and will slowly integrate features like this.   I wish the developers of Android would read threads like these out there more often and see what the basics are that people want    Hangouts should die a firey death.   Thankfully for people like me that just want SMS, google released Messenger.   THIS!  I have a little bit of OCD, and it takes me forever setting up folders and icons   As sarcastic as your post is, it unfortunately looks like it's heading this way.   Like the Surface?   I don't mind this idea, but then again, isn't an Android tablet the same thing?   isn't it a basic part of the build?   All the apps download and my wallpaper is there, but  that's it..  Positions don't get recreated, SMS through messenger isn't backed up, music is lost, photos are lost (yes I have them in drive, but it's not the same).   Haha.. I'll pay that one   But play services could control it?   Yeah but I need to root for that. Why should I have to root to get basic functionality   Google services has been nothing but a pain in the ass.   Especially location services, they destroy my battery    Even better, I want to be able to read or dismiss an email for instance, and it be dismissed on ALL of my devices.    This is what I have been hoping for since I first had an iPhone 3g.. As much as I hate iTunes for everything else, the backup process is flawless and apple should be commended.  I want to be able to factory reset my phone and then be able to restore it to how it was the last time I backed it up.    What do you think Google will do with this update?  - Material design is too new to be altered, unless they make minor improvements.   - Volt revisited? Better battery life and CPU management?   - Give us back the led control?   - Further ingrain your phone backup with google drive?   Not gonna hold my breath..   Well, how would each manufacturer have their way of modifying the image and apps for their devices?  (Not being arrogant, genuinely asking your thoughts).  Google did this with their abortion of a nexus, the Galaxy Nexus.. That brief moment where a Nexus wasn't a Nexus.   Who sends them is what I was after..   So, all manufacturers needs to have their replies / images back to google, then google will release it hey?.. that's good in a way, means that all watches should uphold the 2 year support.   thanks mate,   To be honest, I have been really surprised by my Moto, and it's a fantastic device so far.  If they release the same size but thinner, I'm all over it.   The basics will be that it has a better screen when it comes to resolution and tech used... well, you'd hope so.   Thanks mate, great reply.  The only one of those changes that I am a fan of is probably the WiFi support.    Is there then a 'Nexus' type watch? one that Google uses as a Guinea Pig?   Please say it's the Moto 360 :)   With Android wear basically being the 'nexus' ROM for watches, are all consumers receiving the updates from Google or do the individual manufacturers play with them first and then releasing them?..     EXACTLY what my Moto did a few days ago, I was ready to launch it through a window thinking something was wrong with it.  As soon as I placed it on the charger it sprung back to life instantly.   Is this the update that bring WiFi support to the Moto 360 and others?  Apart from that, what else is 5.1.1 tagging along with it?  I received my 5.1.1 update for my Nexus 9 this morning, and 'meh'.. Once you're on Lollipop it's all the same.   Dropping it..   This.  I wish they would just activate this from factory   I'm guessing she took a tumble?  If I zoom in on your screen, it actually makes a cool looking wallpaper   I find this post just as I start updating my N9..     If I could go back to when I was 14, I would punch 14 year old me in the mouth the moment I touched that first cigarette.  Nothing cool about smoking or vaping.  I vape cause I used to smoke, now I'm giving up vaping.   I got it too, started from 5.0 and hasn't happened since 5.1.1..... Yet   That was done perfectly.  For some reason, I wish it had a little of him from episode 1 where he talks about the spark plugs and how the go BOOM BOOM!   I think MKBHD has started dropping his quality lately.. I just don't get that same quality vibe from him as I did a year ago.  Michael has always been consistent.   To both their credits though, they are both very non biased.   Not me specifically, but I would love to fuse a cow and a pig.   Imagine having cow sized bacon pieces!!  I have even named it as a Pow.   Well, fish can stay under that menu...   The Slavic Squat.   Dunno, anything before the Nexus 4 was a little iffy in my books   3 years ago we would've cringed at the thought of an LG phone!  Give huawei the chance that we all gave LG   Grab the free version off the play store as a sample, but I can assure you it's well worth it.  Just remember, the only limitation you'll have is what the manufacturer will let you see via the port.  Codes has worked on all my cars so far.   Really??  Like enginuity or openecu, but mobile??   Pretty simple really, I don't want to..   Time and engineering making a tube with threads.  Still not buying your argument, completely understand where you're coming from, but don't agree that it costs that much for a mech mod.   Most people these days (majority of Reddit) wouldn't really know what the cycle duty of an injector meant, Torque as an app definitely needs some advertising.  A good ODBII scanner can cost a fortune, and going to a dealer to clear a code can be quite costly.  The full app costs $4.00, this is a tiny fraction of what a scanner can set you back.  I replaced a faulty 02 sensor on my Subaru a while back, I knew it was the 02 sensor because of Torque Pro, and then cleared the code using the same app.    Fantastically.   The full version is great.   It also depends on what info your ECU will relay out via the ODB2 connection, but for the most part it will show pretty much everything.  I love using it to view and clear codes as well.   In the past I've used it to display water temp, boost, vacuum, injector cycle duty, etc..   Funny enough, my 2012 Nexus 7 has the 5.1.1 update this morning.. 23mb!      Torque Pro  Get a $10 obd2 sender from eBay first   Thanks mate :)   That's quicker than my nexus 9   Completely understand that, but a mechanical mod? Really?  Provari have an awesome lab and some great techs there,   you can't tell me it was that hard to design a logo to be etched on a tube when it comes to mech mods  All that separates most mechs is the button.   Yup.. With moderate use and ambient screen off, from 8am to 10pm I'm averaging about 50% battery at the end of day.   That band reminds me of that old brand that you don't see anymore.. UCB - United Colours Benetton, or however it was spelt.   Whats with all the hate of fasttech?  As listed by others, they always deliver, they refund, the have pretty much everything for sale at a great price.  You're paying $7 for a Clone of a Clone, what do you expect?? They sell pricier clones and they're brilliant.  Every one of the clones I've bought from fasttech have been fantastic.  There is a lot of people on here that will bash them purely cause they are a little butthurt for paying 30x the price of the clone, but that's their problem.  If you can afford the original product, that's fantastic, and all power to you.   Let's be realistic here, a copper tube with a little imprint on the side is definitely not worth $150+  Explain to me how Kayfun can justify their prices for a tank?    It took me a while, but I got there eventually   Sure is, but still so relevant.  I hate you.   I'm not racist, I just hate everyone equally.   This is the only form of 'social networking' I do..   Facebook taking over would fuck me over royally.    Bhahaha   Depends on what type of asshole you are.  I had one girl literally stalking me, telling me that she loved how much of arrogant asshole I am.  I was conflicted on how to accept the compliment.. (Think it was a compliment)   From reading the sob story, the first thing I thought of was "maybe there is something wrong with this guy"..  Yup.   He sounds like all the people out of /r/justneckbeardthings. (The memes, not the members)   All I need is king of the hill and I'm set   There is always the other way of winning a boxing match, one person pays more to the judges than the other to win the fight.     I was given a HTC M9 to check out and play with, within 15mins the google launcher, messenger and keyboard were installed.   Within 45 mins I was back to my Nexus.  Enough said really, stock Nexus is perfect.   It's all good.  I had my vape and had my nic hit ;)     I always tried to swipe it in the hope it would just fuck off!   Now I know how people feel when they have their own stuff reposted..      Brilliant look    As dumb as fuck as this is, its quite clever.   You need 'Wild Thing' and Pedro Cerano..   What is it? I've installed and all looks the sane, where is this feature?   Or it could just be a female with a dodgy looking vagina, hence - "she's got a shit cunt"   That's coz' you're a shit cunt!  The most inoffensive insult known to all Aussies.  Being called a cunt is pretty much a positive thing these days.   I have shitty little wrists and the 360 is fine.   $459 AUD   The gold hey?... Hmm... I like the old skool classy look of the gold and a brown leather band, very corporate and formal.  But I do really enjoy the all black look these days    Yup.. I have a VPN and no dice for me either..   I might wait it out for the Moto 360 2   What about when he played Octavio in King of the Hill?   No harm at all, Maths is way beyond my strong point.  But yes, a pack still costs about $6-$8 depending on the brand, and the rest is all tax.   Then when it's been taxed before it hits the shelf, once on the shelf the retailer adds the 'Goods and Services Tax' (GST) of 10%.  A 25 pack of Winfield blue at a service station is ~$25.00  	102
 Marriage to a Westerner? There may be non-profit organizations that may be able to smuggle you out.    I graduated college when you did and I understand this struggle.I think it comes with any transition phase where we are faced with questions like what now, how can I move on, and what will happen? I have small goals (at least one job application a day, even using mouthwash) and larger, season-based goals like finding a new job or getting an internship. Dividing a transition phase from where you are to where you want to be into tinier pieces may make this easier on you. I think you should take some time for yourself too. Good luck :-)   My dad has a cough drop every night at the same time in the same place. Has to be THAT brand and THAT flavor because otherwise, it isn't enjoyable. Maybe this is out of habit, or maybe cough drops have an ingredient in it that soothes the mind. It could also be the association with cough drops and being sick.. Perhaps OP and people like my dad are soothed by cough drops because they assist in the healing process when someone is sick.    Perfection.    Besides awesomely hilarious mustaches, what else do you think contributed to it?   Lost my keys once and found them in my underwear drawer. Also have a bad habit  of switching up the milk   sugar.. Sugar in the fridge, and milk on top of the stove.   THIS is super late, but Wilfred.   Seriously. I'm surprised it hasn't happened again with all the high-tech play toys we have today.    Do you think these people of power (Hitler, Stalin) running WWII had similar characteristics?       I upvoted your username.  	11
 As the title says, I may very well get back into WoW. It has sort of been nagging at my brain for a while. I have a single level 80 but have no idea what to start doing if I were to pick it up again. I haven't really done anything since Wrath. Any help with what I missed and what I should begin with?   Love Bryan Kest, he's excellent and has a great energy.   	2
 I guess but he was found guilty civilly. So its a question that has more to do with he was found innocent here so there is no debate or room for opinion   That subbreddit is garbage and to be fair, im not changing views i havent seen any. Most keep alluring to the jury, but my question is personal view point   Right i support that decision based on the trial but he is still guilty. Are you aware of the book he wrote, that doesnt lead you to question the decision even a lil?   It was presented in the civil case. The prosecutors thought it was an open shut case based on the DNA, and failed to present evidence because of this.   Yea. I believe he was rightfully acquitted due to the poor job by the prosecution but i also believe he is guilty   Well thats the thing, the jury did not receive all the evidence. The prosecutors failed to present the shoes and photo of shoes, the bronco car chsse, phone call, suicide note, possible witness etc. They thought the DNA would do it alone.     I respect your opinion but to say the jury saw all the evidence is not true. So if you still saw all the evidence including the shoes, you would find himn ot guilty? If so why? I understand you might have a different view im trying to understand it thats all   True. Im not trying to do that but because of the two verdicts im wondering if anyone thinks hes innocent?   Im not looking for specific anything as you suggest but to people sayingt he jury made the decision gives no insight to the question   Sure they do. Especially if they were two verdicts that went seperate ways, criminal civil   Thats not true, not even in OJs case. He didnt serve time but they got a considerable chunk of money from him.   Yea but do you really think he didnt do it? If so why?      Are you suggesting the legal system always gets it right?   Thats not the question.      Its clearly in the lab   I forget how big of assholes people in this subreddit are. And how serious they take themselves lol   Im very familar with the civil case. Doesnt answer my question at all. Im not trying to validate my opinion as you suggest, im trying to figure out how others validate theirs on the jury.     I hope you dont think OJ is innocent and think the legal system always get it right.   I already mentioned everything u said in my post. This was more for fun than being a nail on the head. String theory is based on an old theory BTW its not a recent concept as you suggest   I mean he is the one of the best to me, which was the question. To me Reservoir dogs, Pulp fiction, Djano Unchained, and Inglorius Bastards is some of the best films ever made. So that solidfies his status to me.     Diverse is overrated. If Kubrick can make a great scfi flick and great comedy but Tarantino makes two great action flicks, they both made 2 great flicks. I dont give one the edge because one was more diverse. Plus quention has done horror, martial arts, 2 period pieces, action, etc he is very diverse imo.      Very rarely do all great directors also write their scripts, everytime. This alone puts him high on the list. Some may be a better technical director but Tarantino has a style all to his own, you cant watch 5 mins of anything he directs and not know its him. This has to be respected. I dare you to find a director who has done so much with so little, in a time when so much more is available.     He could not put out another movie wouldnt change my opinion. Its not about diversity or quanitity or even technicality, its about Quality. Every movie he has put out, except 1 imo, has been top knotch.   Good point   Blow by Arteyu is hype worthy   Hail to the King. Av7    I imagine im the king and all these bitches are kneeling, and im sceaming HAIL TO THE KING.......afterwards im super hyped   Not true. Some of the scenes in the movie yes but not the majority      And the sequel begins exactly where 300 left off. Then later there is some flashbacks   No it wasnt. Just saying the jury made a decision is irrelavant and obvious. His second comment addressed the question directly.     Perhaps you should post comments on the topic at hand.....   An opinion has always existed, most people then think the jurors were idiots and same as now. Although i have seen polls as of 2014/15 that showed the majority of blacks believe he is guilty, directly the opposite to polls after the trial. With the increase of believers its reasonable to assume more have accepted the widely presumed theory that the jurors were morons, hence recent times.     I also dont think the jurors final decision is always right although in this case they were based on the cases presented before them. Had the evidence been presented properly and the verdict was still not guilty i would consider the decision wrong and the jurors morons.   Good will hunting. Simple, drama, a lil comedy   If so why is it so unknown and why do you like/dislike?       If you havent and like rock, do yourself a favor and check it out.   Recent as in recent times   So was your first comment, that i was referring to.    My favorite saints player of all time.   Rounders. Worm is an all time favorite of mine.   I get that but i disagree all jury decisions are the right one. In this case yes but in every case is a major misstep IMHO.   Matthew is not nessicarily an astronaut in Interstellar. He confirms he has nver left the stratosphere   Based on what?   Just a curiosity to your comment, are you impling all jurors decisions are right?   Good point   Fair points but im speaking more to a recent opinion of the verdict.   Ok but why do the majority of people call the jurors morons and rag on the verdict?   The good shepard was badass   Fuhrman was never proven to specifically have tampered with the evidence but tampering was proven. To me you take the Dna evidence off the table he is still clearly guilty but all the evidence wasnt presented.     So you are saying people didnt realize the jury wasnt presented with all the evidence so its considered a bad verdict, I could see that.   If we are talking about say Louisiana where no weed consumption is legal, having such in your system can be used against you. Personal experience     Also THC and its levels in your system are case by case. Your body does not react to storing it the way another person's body will.   But having such in your system regardless of how much can be used against you.   Good point. Although there are several factors that could lead to this that doesnt involve time   Weed can be driven out of your system much quicker than 30 days. It depends on your usage of weed, water consumption and fat content      Yes, if they find weed in your system it can be used against you.   But Bruce wayne played by the same actor hasnt aged or changed any.   Ridley admits this was not a prequel, very clearly. Would you like the link?   There was very little of his blood on those items, most of the blood was the victims. It was even proven the blood on the sock was planted. But that becomes irrevalant when doubt about the evidence gathering is put into question.     This was not the home run evidence nor should it have been treated as such. And the obvious morons were the prosecutors not the jury   A major shift up from Martin Scorcese?   You mean all the evidence presented at the trial or all the evidence period?   Yes. Lets put all the evidence aside. Who writes a book about a murder of your ex wife, mother to your children, explaning how you did it, if you are innocent?   If he hired someone to do it wouldnt you be sure to have an alibi? Where did the inch deep cut on his hand come from?      Ferhman only had a small part in the case, to think he solely set up OJ is ludricous, just because he lied about having said niger in the last ten years. Also remember the countless times Nichole called the cops on OJ when he wasnt arrested. This is not the actions of a force that disliked OJ but one of those who admired his football skills   Well there was evidence that OJs blood was tampered with. His Dna went missing in the lab, later a forensic expert admitted to spilling it on his glove and continued to work on items on the case with the glove. The fact that doubt could be brought up here makes it not a suitable fact to be the center of the case.     Not to mention DNA was relatively new and hard to understand. This process should not have been the focus or jammed down the jurors throats. Considering the mountain of evidence they had they should have presented a mountain, instead of a hill of DNA evidence.   Its a damn shame really. And if this case is prosecuted properly, he is convicted. In my personal opinion the shoes is the most damning evidence of all, it proves OJ is lying. They simply ignored this aspect and missed the widely obtainable photo.      Its unpopular because he obviously commited the murders and people DV this because of it. But you are right a product of the justice system, a system where the truth is disregarded for who can argue best.   I think there are solid cases made that Jesus did not exist well outside the realm of reddit. Although i agree he was a real person, it is in some regard disputatable.   I disagree all his movies are poorly written. I love the house of a 1000 corpses, its sequel, and the Halloween remakes for the writing and directing. And he is still in his early stages of both with his best work yet to come IMHO   Also OJ was rightfully acquitted. Guilty 100% but the prosecutors did a hatchet job with the case leaving out the bronco fleeing attempt, the bruno magla shoes, putting Ferhman on the stand, letting OJ put on the gloves himself, etc. They focused way too much on questionable hard to understand DNA evidence.     OJ  was guilty but it was not proven in court.   Iraq invasion was the right thing to do.    Where would " you" rank Tarantino is asking exactly for personal favorites lol.    I simply asked why you think having Tarantino in my top three means I haven't watched many movies? Furthermore the post asks for your ranking and not an explanation. You want me to respond to a close minded comment with an open minded question, doesn't make a lot of sense.    Lol how else did you expect a response to a conceded question?    What makes you think I haven't? Like ability in movies is personal opinion, what makes you think I don't just put Tarantino above the many directors I've watched And the countless films I've seen?    My theory does explain all that you allur to. But this isn't that theory as a whole, it's the about this scene specifically.       Any thoughts on the major inconsistency in this scene?    Keanu reeves in that baseball movies. Where he coaches the kids, so bad.    From Rounders. "If you can't spot the sucker at the table in the first thirty minutes, then you are the sucker."    From hell. Johnny deep in a story about the investigation of Jack the Ripper. For that matter Sleepy Hollow as well.       Mystic river     Gone baby gone      This is not true. The director has already confirmed it is not a prequel to alien.    Avatar      There will be blood     Inglorious bastards, Django unchained     Inception      The Lord of the rings      The aviator    Zombie takes a lot of his inspiration from the horror films of the seventies. House of a 1000 corpses was a sort of tribute to that, looking at it in that light it was very well done. Take the budget into account as well.      I think he is a very good director who has yet to tap into his true potential. I think he is severely underrated. I can't wait to see what he does next, and will undoubtedly watch and support his upcoming films.   Chronicle of Riddick      The two towers, return of the king. The hobbit movies, sort of, really not a sequel but a continuance of the story.      Batman returns      300 rise of an empire      EDIT:why the downvotes which movie doesnt apply to the topic?   Leo is better no doubt. Leo has proven he can consistently play a lead role with extreme success. He also has shown he can steal the spotlight as a supporting role, Ie Calvin Candy. Benicio while a great actor in his own right is mostly in a supporting role, and no where near the range.     Also for Martin Scorcese to deem you worthy of five of his movies all with the lead role, is enough praise to put him ahead of many of the working actors today, alone.    Red light is pretty awful, although I think de Niro does a decent job. There is also a movie with him and travolta that starts out good but takes a turn for the worse, and neither deliver a good performance.    Top three all time. With several off his movies being in my top ten. I also consider him the greatest writer of all time.       EDIT Taratino writes all his scripts, has a style all of his own, highly successful, has done horror, martial arts, western, period pieces, action(a major element of comedy in all), has made some of the most memorable films of all time and recent times. Why all the DVs on my opinion he is in my top 3?         Usually the delivery and placement has a lot to do with it. Plus the memorable factor, one line that can be easily remembered but pertains to the movies content.    I will start with, Tolkien began writing The silmarillion before the Hobbit and LOTR. He was a language addict, he spoke 12 or more languages and studied ancient ones. Eventually creating his own. He wanted to create a world where the creations in it spoke this language, hence the Silmarillion. This was his original motive. After years of work, with many pauses in progress due to in his academic work this novel was put to the side but it is the first work of ME, and predates all others. He then wrote The hobbit for his children to enjoy, using the universe he had already created but not yet finished. Upon the sucess of the Hobbit and fan request he began LOTR. Always coming back to the Silmarillion but never completeing it. So.....     In the silmarillion, it predates the LOTR's and the Hobbit beginning at the start of the universe. In his telling of the beginning of everything, it starts with an ominpotent Being,Eru. He creates the Holy ones, which he thens sings songs too which starts off the creation of the world, and Middle Earth.      Very much like String theory, which is compared to musical notes and their different frequencies. With the process explained here, Eru creates the strings and then begins to create the universe with them by singing and using different frequencies.      Eventually one of these Holy ones, starts to rebel and tries to instill competition amoung the rest. This holy ones' rebel wants to create different frequencies and rule over all. This could be seen as the early formation of the Selfish gene. He rebels against Eru with selfish ambition and trys to take over. Eru refuses to destroy the rebel as he loves all his creations. Instead he bans him to ME, which he eventually effects everything. The selfish gene thrives and even creates creatures. By the time the source is sent back to Eru, the gene has inhabited and infected everyone and everything.      A little loose but it does have some merit imho. When i first heard of String theory and its comparison to music i thought of Tolkien. He couldnt have possibly known about String theory but stumbled upon this explanation. There has to be something that lead him to favor this way for the universe to start, gut feeling maybe or blind luck. Im not saying string theory is correct either.      What do you all think? Open to suggestions   Spoiler Alert. The end speech with Borden and Angier. I believe i have found a major clue to Angier's deceit in narrarated scenes and evidence to stregthen the machine doesnt work theory. When Angier is telling Borden about the 1st clone ive noticed a major inconsistency that would lead me to believe its proof or a subtle clue that Angier is lying.      When he shoots the 1st clone, in the flashback at the end, its in Teslas' lab seemingly after its been burned down. You do not see Tesla or the assistant in the lab as to suggest they have already fleed Edison's men. Edison's men burn down the lab right after they flee. Only then does Angier have solo use of the machine, after the Lab has been burned down. There is no logical way for Angier to have been in the Lab alone, its guarded by electrical fences and gadgets to keep Edison's men away, before Tesla flees. There is no logical way for Angier to be there after its burned down.       The scene shows Angier kill the first clone in Teslas lab. With no tesla or his assistant, during daylight. This implies its after he has been given the machine, after Tesla flees. This would be impossible since the Lab has been burned down at this point.      This is a direct clue that Angier is lying. It also solidifies his willingness to fabricate stories to Borden, giving credence to a made up diary. Pair this with the air bubble in the only visible tank, and Angier seemingly gaining full control of his damaged leg, these are some of the subtle, ambigious clues we are told watch closely for.      Im fairly certain this scene is a clue and doesnt make sense. Imho Angier is lying as he is about the machine. This is Nolan masking the true trick of the film well. Want to see what you all think about this scene and if im not missing anything i might post a revised theory on the machine. Lmk if this wasa  great catch or why im wrong.    Experience, and as Hendrix asked "Are you experienced?"    I thought it was a classic IMHO    That's a shame, I'm sure there is a good movie in there somewhere.    Yea I love Snatch, and I agree it was better. I really like lock as well, but this movie was better IMO. I felt like it was just like those movies too, what made you dislike this one?    Maybe, although I'm not worried at all. James Cameron is a much better director IMO as well. I also love the story of Avatar, not the most popular opinion on reddit, so I'm excited to see what's the next step in the journey.     Like I said I haven't even seen a 3-d movie yet or avatar on the big screen so I'm highly anxious. I'm assuming the hype is gonna get out of hand and it will break all the records.    I'm not sure how popular this movie is but damn this was awesome. If you have seen it what did you think? If not go watch it. Reminded me of the movie "Thursday", both flew under my radar but by the time I got to them people had forgetting them.      Also it kind of ended on a hint at a sequel. Has anyone heard of one possibly being made?    Freedom in Django Unchained when Django is having flashbacks. That shit chokes me up every time.    He would have been badass in Gone Girl in affleck's role. Maybe even the bad guy in the new Bond movie.    Leo the same in every movie is laughable. He is a phonomenal actor with a huge range. Leo not receiving an oscar thus far is more a knock on the oscars.     J edgar Hoover      Howard Hughes     Jordan Belford     Retarded grape      Calvin candy      Jack Dawson     Laughable..........   2001     Now it's gotta be avatar 2 they keep changing the release date, but it seems to be set in stone now. Considering I missed avatar on the big screen, I can't wait for avatar 2. Most anticipated movie for me ever, I still have not seen 3-d yet, I holding out for the sequel.    It's best to have read the book for references. Even though it's mostly different, the book helps identify the "shine" and the hotel.     It's about a family with a struggling marriage and a "special" son. The hotel is fueled by Danny and its ghost convince jack to kill the family. That's about it. Kubrick also does some crazy stuff. He shoots every scene from eye sight level and you almost feel like you are a ghost following around the Torrance family. He rearranges the carpet, fixtures, pictures on the wall, mid scene and all kinds of things. It's a very dark movie but filmed in a very neat way.   Cast away       The girl with the dragon tattoo   The prestige     Reservoir dogs     The game      We own the night     Kiss the girls     Rules of engagement      Mr brooks    I like this a lot.       To add to it, this is how the end could play out. The older brother after having come to terms leAving earth is the best possibility, long drawn out process in the film, decides to help Edmund. With his pull from being a war hero in a time after the war in a broken country, he helps sustain funding for the missions. He helps to fund and set up funds for the Lazarus mission in his attempt to rekindle his relationship with Edmund(younger brother). He becomes close to Dr. Brand waiting to hear back from Edmund, like Matthews' daughter does in interstellar.      Upon getting close to Brand he figures out that Plan A is useless, that the Human race cannot be saved and his brother Edmund was sent under the wrong pretenses. Upon finding this out he confronts Dr Brand, and things get out of hand. Dr brand ends up shooting the older brother, as he lay there dying he begins to recite a poem to brand , one which he has never heard "Do not go gentle into the that dark night. Rage rage against the dying of the light........" The movie ends with dr brand standing over the body in his office, breathing heavy digesting the mans last dying words, the screen goes black..........then we hear the oldest brother take his last breath and utter the last words in the poem, Rage Rage. Then a baddass tune kicks in and the credits roll   Yea that could have some effect, reading the book. But take in mind the change in time frame to the book. This would greatly help Nolan in masking the trick, as far as the legal system, the trial, the use of simple magic. It is also my understanding tesla was also added, he was not in the book. Which would lend to help Nolan disguise the trick. But I'm not sure about that Lmk what is the truth here.      I will leave you with a quick version of the theory, but keep in mind it's got much more details and evidence then this. But it should help you rewire yourself into viewing the movie from angiers pov when you rematch the movie.     Angier visits tesla and realizes he has no " magic". He has no working machine as when he had none when Borden visited. So he begins to devise a plan to frame Borden, not just kill him but ruin his reputation, even steal his daughter. But he has a major problem, Borden has ruined his reputation when he sabatoges his trick and double. Borden's second successful attempt to sabotage Angier. No one would hire Angier for some simple trick.     So he uses the fact Borden sends him to tesla. He uses this useless machine to add flair to the old transported man to give the illusion of " real magic". Enough to add him a spot for a theater and give him efficient amount of time to set the frame in play. So Angier spends these months " visiting tesla" preparing his frame up and sobering up  root. A now very well paid root which was the sum of his issues anyway, money. Remember Angiers motive is not good magic at this point it's only to frame Borden. So if he was trying to top Borden at this point, root would not be a good hire but it's not he is only trying to frame Borden. This also why the blind stage hands, and why Caine is never let back stage. He is even scolded in a scene when he tries.     So Angier is the pledge and turn and all root does is the prestige( coming out the top of the balcony) that's it.       Again there is abunch more to it, dealing with the tanks and bodies etc. but I'm tired of typing. If you are interested in the rest Lmk and I'll finish it later.    1)you have to remember that Borden is caught red handed. No one suspects foul play here. And I disagree that forensics was more or even considered sophisticated at all in the the time frame of the movie. So for no reason for anybody to suspect anything there would be no extensive investigation. There are blind stage hands backstage and the only person who saw was Caine who catches a longtime rival red handed with plenty motive. This was the classic open shut case, then take in the legal system of the time.    2)I understand your points but to me it's a little contradictive to portray what real magic is what it takes and have it switched on you. This doesn't make sense to me.     3)sure the bubbles could be interpreted as anything. But they took the extra effort to cgi it in, or purposely not take it out. I believe this has more significance than is widely considered.    4)this diary is also given to Angier on purpose by Borden. The encryption is planned ahead of time, because he willingly gives Angier the diary.    5)well when Angier shoots the clone you do not see Tesla or his assistant in the lab. This would imply it's being used after tesla has given him the machine, when tesla flees Edison's men. I believe a direct clue to lend you to believe Angier is lying.      6)I agree interpretation can be done many ways. Although my assesment is people are missing the obvious. Just as Angier does to Borden, just as Borden does to Angier, and as Nolan is doing to the audience.      On the edit, true this can be taken many ways as can the bubble. But instead of thinking its a mindless error or poor calculation, in the theory these become vital clues.     Your post was well said many good points although I feel if you look at the movie different you will see my side. Might not agree but there is validity in my points IMHO       Edit. To the birds point. The birds are killed and replaced with doubles not clones. Furthermore Angier figures out a way to save the birds, save the original. Only when Borden comes along does the bird get killed. Very similar to the way it plays out in the theory.    Fair point. I just figured it was well known, not well accepted, well known    It seems like alot of younger people especially havent. But i could be wrong wouldnt be the 1st time   Whats the good fight?   Jumanji   He use to be a crackhead though, all them fuckers can take and cause alot of damage.....alot.   Only one has a BMF leather engraved wallet though. I gotta take Jackson   Ill start with the incosistancies.     1)Angier gives Borden a diary that could prove his innocence days before he is to be executed. A day or two before he actually goes to the jail     2)The movie makes constant references to how real majic is done and it has nothing to do with "real magic"     3)The air bubble in the only visible tank at the end. The fact Angier gains full control of his leg while drowning after the film goes though length to show how damaged it is     4)Borden sends Angier to Tesla the one person who can produce a similar result as a twin is unbelieveable and could have been done a much more logical way. Why connect these two if there is no need to?     5)The scene where Angier shoots the first clone, the flashback at the end, happens in Teslas' lab seemingly after its been burned down. A fabricated scene in the theory     Angier uses a double, and sets up the trick during his "visits with tesla". Caine identifies the double in the morgue, with a quick glance ill add. At this point there is no reason for suspicion. They have a body and have his long time rival caught red handed. Caine during the trial is under the impression the trick was real and Angier isd ead. He is never let in on the trick and its why he particapates in the trial.     I can give more detail lmk. But you have to be willing to accept Nolan is attempting to pull the wool over your eyes, and if you follow the clues you will see.   This whole back and forth has been sick.....SICK AS FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but its pretty funny    The machine doesnt work and its a tool of deceit used by Angier to frame Borden. With Nolan playing the true trick on the audience and its what we are told to look for twice, "Are you watching closely? But you wont see. You want to be fooled. You want it to be real." Said before and after Bordens trick is revealed     There are too many inconsistencies in the plot for it to be a straightforward film, with much evidence pointing to Angier deceit, IMHO.   Good point, gonna add this in as well   Its proven the comforters rarely get washed, if ever. Its not common knowledge but it should be.     The first thing you do is remove the comforter then plop down   Possible, although i like the idea that was presented that they were an ally, alot   And potentially very nasty   And you plop right down onto a cum ridden rarely washed comforter. Ewwwwww  	105
       Such great eye for detail and the steady pulse for precision.    You'd be tempted to do the same thing if you keep on watching these cute little buddies.    That's the thing about people these days. It's easy for them to point fingers and condemn others for their actions, but they don't see themselves not doing anything. If you don't have anything good to say, and if you don't do anything good to change what you're complaining about, zipping your mouth could be a better idea.    I wonder how many women would do this to their men. I can see some special skills and a great deal of affection in there.    Dogs will appreciate whatever you do to them. But it's good to see humans showing too much concern for their pets when some only cause heartaches to some of our furry friends.    This happens come payday! Where did the salary go?       It has been proven many times that friends and business don't go well together. It's either you lose one, or both. It's better to tell them directly that you want to give this a shot on your own. Not because you want to show off, but because you want to prove your worth as a person and as an up and coming entrepreneur.                Seems like the power entitled to being a member of the police force has gone through the head of these officers. I am totally out of words to say except for expletives.   	15
 Do not listen to the third one. I do not want people to think this is what Germany is listening to.    An internet recorded whilst holding the camera steady. non I can die happy.   Thank you.   I do not like the /r/nofap thing though.    Coo. Thank you.    Well, let's say it's difficult. I really like it you know.   I am just wondering if anybody else feels weak after masturbating . Even like an hour later I still don't feel at full strength.    Most boring city in Europe. Such a disappointment       And Saturday night?    I like it but I feel you should crop off the top. If you don't, part of the roof has to be in focus as well.    So, can I post a video of me cutting some bread? I'm not saying people will enjoy it, but I can, right?    Not a chemical reaction at all.   Not  At  All   thank you very much   Even if my example is bad, the point remains. I am sorry if I gave a bad example. It does not change that when supply increases, price goes down.    UK alternatives?    I don't understand. What made them decide to go to the gym now that did not apply when they were 40 kg lighter? Why wait so long to do something about your weight?   Maybe, but I hate my wake up melody at the moment and it really annoys me.    This is so perfect!   I appreciated your pretentious shit a lot. I'll see if Miles and /r/jazz will do any good for me. Thank you!    I know TT exists for Android, but its unplayable on my z3compact.   I am considering to buy (in Germany) and talked to my friend to get some advice. He told me that I should consider two points when deciding to get a mortgage:  **1. Rising Interest Rates**  This is obvious for everybody and all you guys probably know this. When you take out a mortgage you not only have to calculate if you are able to shoulder the monthly payments now, but you also have to calculate if you will be able to if interest rates rise to a certain level as soon as your interest rate changes. In Germany interest rates are normally fixed for 10 years. After that the interest rate WILL change according to the level they are at then. So you will have to try and anticipate a worst case scenario and find out if you can still pay your mortgage. Again, this is basic stuff and if you do not take this into consideration yet, you really should.  **2. If house prices drop**  Even though people on this sub might be mindful about point 1, a lot of people in the real world are not. They are (and have been) taking out mortgages for the past years because interest rates are so low. And that is fair enough. However as soon as interest rates will go up (and they will at some point) many of those people might not be able to afford their mortgage anymore and will be forced to sell. Personally I think that many people take out mortgages that are on the limit of what they can afford (because they want the nicest house they can get). As a consequence many people will be forced to sell when interest rates go up. This might lead to a decrease in real estate values because the market will be flooded with property. See Detroit. This will then mean that your security with the bank (your house) loses value and the bank will increase the mortgage repayments because of the increased risk. This might then lead to further house sales and boom! Bubble!  **My message is:** When you take out a mortgage, take the above two points into consideration and make sure that if either happens you will still be able to pay the bank otherwise you will lose your home. I am not saying don't take out a mortgage. Just make sure you consider possible future scenarios.   Can you recommend some? I don't know anything about Jazz.    Cello Suite no 1 is exactly what I was looking for. Thanks    Saved because it's great music, but not what I would like to wake up to. Thanks for the music though    To wake me up, not to prepare me for battle. Great theme though    Awesome song. Saved it to my playlist. But not uplifting enough to wake me up.       This is not a photo of a real person.   This is a CGI, right?   Sorry, I chose the wrong word. What I meant was:  We accept that they are a different kind of people. We love them, celebrate them, follow them, want to be like them. They give us something so I believe that is the reason we accept that they are so rich.       Exactly he even experiences changes in the environment. When the ground changes as his house is destroyed the time machine is bouncing like a low-rider. So he must actually be present at every single point in time along his journey.    As the machine is travelling to the future, it is still always in the same place. Therefore whoever is standing next to it should be able to see it because it is not instantly going to the new time, but just moving through time faster. The passenger should only appear to be moving slower depending on the speed the time machine is travelling at.  I posted this before in /r/movies      Not trying to say other answers are wrong but I believe part of the answer is:  For drunken sex the person who is not intoxicated is being held responsible to protect the intoxicated person (because they cannot defend themselves)  For drunk driving the person who is intoxicated is being held responsible to protect the people on the streets, who do not have a way of defending themselves against a car with a drunk person driving.  When the goal is the well being of the people this makes sense from my point of view. The situations are not comparable because there is alcohol involved, but because the well being of people is at stake and the rules have been made based on that.  I hope I got my point across.    My understanding is that if two identical clocks would have been created very soon after the big bang in places that have experienced different gravity until today both clocks would show a different age for the universe.    I know. And it's funny as well.    Sounds like a good business model to me.    I was expecting lots of people to like this, but I found that most of you don't really feel like it should be killed.   You guys go! Killing animals should NOT be entertainment for us.    The water interferes with the touch screen though. It's slightly annoying.    I am rooted and flashed the lollipop rom by myself.

Go on /r/leangains  Those people make solid progress.    +1   Can I just say that supercritical is an awesome word.    I think it's because celebrities are untouchable. They have a magical skill that we accept as being special.   The CEO of a company on the other hand is just some guy. He has to work like everybody else. He sits in a chair in front of a computer like everybody else, but he gets paid 10000 times what we get. That is the reason if you ask me. It's because their job is too close to what we do for a living but his salary is way higher than ours    The white motherfucker who...    I've got the same problem actually. And I have no solution for you.    Maybe you're trying too hard to use difficult words?    I just won't let other people have their way even if it has no impact on my life. I just HAVE to comment.   I hate myself every single time.    Try saying bacon is not god food.    Me included: people feel too free to make arrogant statements that they would never make in real life because it's unacceptable behaviour. And often it's wrong as well.    You need to use the elevator to escape but only half the group fits.    I quite like that one actually.   She cold   Was that her team-mate or the host?    Well I live in London and hate shopping here. Everywhere is the same (reiss, massimo dutti, topshop, zara, etc.) or its way to alternative. I would like to find somewhere that sells shirts, jeans, t-shirts and jumpers that are not branded but decent (not necessarily great) quality. I don't want to be spending 90 per shirt though.   I might be asking for something that does not exists but I am personally very disappointed with the selection in London if you are not willing to spend crazy money   Would you mind recommending other places in London where I can find some cool clothes?    Did he do anything? Or why is he being arrested?    Light up there is just very good. I think that makes a very big difference.    ... 50% of the times.    I'm on mobile.

Edit: there http://tidyingup.com/  I haven't tried it myself but sounds like it makes sense.    How many calories is that?    I made a similar experience.   the only thing I want to add is:   Because this sub is relatively small your post won't just disappear when downvoted. The result is that even though your post has zero upvotes it will still be visible for people who actually want to help.   What I am trying to say is: If you post something you'll get two types of replies: The ones you mention but also helpful advice.   Just ignore the ones you don't like and reply to the good ones.    I recommend you try for a while and see if you make satisfactory progress.   If you don't then it doesn't work. Trial and error is the only thing you can do if there are restrictions in your life.    Or, OP should just do what is possible for him and see if it works for him.   It doesn't make sense for him to think about it. He should try and see if the result are satisfactory. If not, then obviously it's no good.   Thanks guys. I've ordered the peanut butter .   Thanks for telling me I'm a pussy. I think I needed that.   Thank you. Just ordered it.    Cool. Ordered 1kg Peanut Butter. Thanks.    I have a slight problem and just wanted to know if you guys went through the same.  I was on 1600-1800 kcal a day for a long time and got used to it. Now I started bulking and really struggle to eat 2400kcal.   I guess its easy to get there by just eating McD and shit like that. But eating the same healthy and filling stuff I ate before makes it almost impossible.   What do you guys think? How are you doing it?    Too big for me. I've got tiny hands.    If I see a guy in the gym with terrible form, do I tell them? I do not look like I know what I am talking about.    If my TDEE for maintenance is 2100 kcal per day (desk job and no sport considered) how much do I need to eat to bulk?   I understand that the answer should be 2600kcal. But if I go to the gym 3 times a week, the TDEE calculator tells that I need 2400kcal for maintenance (desk job and working out 3 times a week). Do I need to eat 2900kcal?  This always confuses me and is never made clear anywhere. I do leangains and I need +20% maintenance on workout days and -20% on rest days, but I never know what I am calculating from.    You better think again. It clearly is. Let me know when you figured it out.    You have been places. Your pictures are amazing.    You can't just make me feel this way and then just drop me. Why would you do that? Yes it is complicated now but you have a responsibility now.    I don't understand. I am over 30   This is gold. I love you.    Sorry, actually you are right about that. That is no comparison. Did not mean to waste your time.    You did not answer the question.   There is no evidence any/all of them are actually predators. If you are being accused of something, its all the same if you are innocent.    Got any more like this?   I understand what you say and I 100% agree with the fact that none of these rules are "god given" or simply right. Exactly my viewpoint. Fairness is also a human construct and we should not think that this is a universal rule for the whole universe.   However I believe that if you are part of a society you should accept the rules and norms of that society. If you do not, then you should also not claim for you the benefits that the society has to offer. Your call. If you claim the benefits and don't follow the rules, I don't like what you are doing and I will express that. Again, such a person should not be forced to do any of what I believe to be correct behavior, but if they don't then I will (and so does /u/pancakessyrup ) comment on that. Personally I think his argument is spot on and flawless. But I accept that it's all a matter of opinion.   I just want to point out one thing:  I am sure all these people who now say that /u/pancakessyrup is a dick will suddenly agree with him when they have their lives destroyed by a stupid TV show (no matter if guilty or not). Peoples believes go straight out the window when their own ass is on the line. So I can only respect /u/pancakessyrup for being aware of that .   God, I really wonder if you can manage to go home and have a nice cold beer and just relax after all this. It would infuriate me.    I think what you should consider is this:   Hansen has the right to do so, but not the obligation. He could choose to let the legal system work and not make the TV show. Nobody is taking that right away from him. It is a matter of opinion.   However the people he accuses have their right for fair trial taken away by Hansen.   Do you know what I mean?   What are those holes? I am eager to learn.    Sorry to get involved in your thing here. I am not judging and don't care about you. I am just curious:  How would you feel, if a girl lured you into her room and had sex with you when it turns out afterwards it was for a TV show and she was actually only 16 and you are being accused of being a predator on TV. The thing is, maybe you are, maybe you are not. But in case you are not, how would you feel about it?  Edit: The reason why I am asking is: I am sure some of them are predators, and some of them are not. Is it ok to sacrifice the ones who are not, just so you can destroy the ones who are?   Not jokes ...  ...  ...  NOT!   At first I got really annoyed by people writing that a certain question is getting old. After a while it really got on my nerves as well.   True story.    I am a buyer for auxiliary equipment.  I want to either be a carpenter and refurbish furniture or have my own pub (which would show football on Saturdays)  Edit: God, I am happy I was able to answer. I though I didn't know what I want, but it seems I do. Just need to figure something out that's more realistic (at least in the short run)   Final line is amazing.   I personally think this is the best I have seen. Not because it look sooooooooooooooooo spectacular but because of how well it's done. You must have put so much work into this.   I love it. And also the fact that you are not trying to sell it by showing skin. You look awesome   Seriously, thank you very much. There is a sky scraper close to work. I'll try to take it slow and work my way to the top.   I think this is really good advice. Thank you.    Thank you.   I should have kept reading the comments. Sorry to waste your time.   Everybody who tells me to avoid them:  Thank you for participating, but 1 thing I am sure of is: Going out of your way to avoid feeling the fear is the worst you can do.    What am I looking at?   Looks good to me though. What exactly happened?   What I don't understand is how do they just slide smoothly in place. I feel like there should always be a short CRACK, when they connect.   Please do so.   I think it's nice if people want to start getting into a form of art. If this is your first attempt and you're trying to get better at it, then I hope you will do well.   At the same time I am guessing you will want constructive criticism. There is one major problem with using an app (or not putting in the necessary effort)  On the left side the tree and the plant should either be completely in focus or completely out of focus. If they are not it ruins the picture. In this particular picture the plant should be completely out of focus and the tree should be in focus judging by how you chose the area that is in focus. If the app is any good, then you should be able to draw on areas that should be in/out of focus. I would love to see how the picture turns out if you change those two points.   No offense. Seriously.    I think he says "I don't wanna bang this chick"    When I look at female hard bodies (not the body builder type, just fit with muscles) I always think that I would be more than happy with their physique. (I am male)  Can I understand they also had to bulk at some point?  I am currently on a cut and don't really want to bulk because I used to be fat and am scared to just get fat again but I def need some more muscles.    In a good way, right?    I love the stuff and it fits my macros. However I cannot help but wonder if I should be eating less. I eat about 250g per day (sometimes 500g)   Not very pareto...  Edit: Thinking about it, I don't have enough information to make that statement.   I like this explanation.   However as far as I remember, he doesn't. As soon as she gets the watch his time in the tesseract is over and he ends up years later in space. Is that incorrect?   I don't understand why it is ticking anyway. My friend says its due to the manipulated gravity in the room. If that is correct, then it should stop ticking as soon as she leaves the room.   Might be totally wrong because I don't really understand the fucking movie but here goes:  Her dad is trying to give her that equation right? He seems to believe the best way is to communicate it via morse code. I don't like the idea, but that's fine.   I found it weird that he is able to manipulate the watch to do this. After all he has been granted access to an extra dimension and not given unlimited super powers. My friend thinks that he manipulates the watch through gravitation the same way he did when he communicated the first message (sand on the ground). Again, I don't like that idea but that is not my point.   She looks at the watch, recognizes its morse code and has to leave because her brother is coming back.   Did she immediately understand and memorize the whole thing? As far as I understand dad was only able to manipulate gravity in that room. I believe the watch should have been useless once she left the room.    I read this book:  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nothing-Very-Short-Introduction-Introductions/dp/0199225869  The universe (the vacuum) is not empty at all. Very interesting read.

Just because all of it already exists does not mean its good or userfriendly. Doing existing things better is also innovation.   So if you are right that it will never happen, then you have a point.

It is not known how or why this avian influenza strain is spreading so rapidly:  "As a third U.S. state declared a state of emergency, scientists are scrambling to understand the H5N2 avian influenza virus that is ravaging poultry farms across the Midwest. At least 30 million birds in 12 states have been affected so far, either infected directly or scheduled to be culled, in the largest outbreak of a high-pathogenicity avian flu virus in the United States in decades. The new strain, which emerged in wild birds along the Pacific flyway several months ago, has not yet infected any humans, but researchers are puzzled by its path of transmission and other characteristics. An ambitious case-control study about to be launched by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the University of Minnesota, and the turkey industry may help answer these questions."

 Literally paying brokers political rents.   I see them, too. The place I work is doing civil for some redevelopment. There are big problems in Balt with underground utilities and the concept of re-using existing row home frontage.  The Balt city government did a massive public works project a few decades ago and "upgraded" the city water mains. That is in scare quotes because they used reinforced concrete for pressurized mains. At any given time, there is a major road closure because the pipe has popped. Any redevelopment needs to address this and that means it only makes financial sense to do work an entire block at a time.  When people drive through the empty parts of the city, they see the backs of buildings burnt out and the fronts mostly fine but boarded up. Many of these shells could be refilled with a home. It is a waste of time, though, because of the structure of the blocks. First, there is very little hope for anyone to use these mass-produced buildings for small business. The lot size and access are not there. Second, you would have to get the zoning changed and to do that you would have to get grassroots support. While you are doing that you might as well get an entire new government elected. I've been in those offices and met those people. Plenty are capable and confident, but the private development process is not lean by and stretch or chew. Third, the streets are too wide. Three to four lanes of sometimes considerable car traffic will kill any neighborhood. The frontage needs to be closer and the streetscape needs to put the pedestrian in charge. While you are doing this, you might as well shorten the short side of blocks and add a few northing roads, or make square blocks with courtyards.  Bonus problem: MD RT40 "the highway to nowhere" is a 50ft deep cut that bisected a thriving black community when it was built. The city fell hard after that for various reasons, but since it did not much redevelopment and infrastructure restructuring was completed in the area - leaving the area filled with owners but the need for massive changes.  Bonus problem #2: Flooding and storm drains. the watershed for the streams that run into the harbor are concrete, now, so they flash the water down. The city needs some greenbelts inside the limits.  Bonus problem #3: The highland hills. Baltimore is not flat. I'm not talking about the potholes, but some of those statistically contribute to elevation variance IMO.  Bonus benefit: There is enough property to redevelop in the city to spur billions of dollars in growth. Get a good amount of three to five story buildings and you can bring in local mass transit, so leave room for future trolleys in the streetscape.  Bonus benefit: Urban farming. Baltimore has many parks, community gardens, and entrepreneurial farmers.   Also improvements or redevelopment.    If someone is keeping sufficient tabs on a property to ~~launch~~ *respond to* a dispute, then it's not really abandoned.  ftfy, as I see it.  EDIT: What I'm saying is that it doesn't matter if someone who does not own a property yet desires the property, but it does matter if the owner is able to be tied to the property and contacted or will notice any physical intrusion or inquiry.

Cutting out the administrative overhead of insurance companies could be more efficient.

Humans have rights inherent in our nature. Animals have rights inherent in their nature.

Its not like you have to look happy or anything, but...     They know it will destroy the system and they benefit from the system.  What makes you think your system won't be destroyed, too? Rhetorical.   but if the government can't solve the issue of greed certainly the 'pure market' (pure greed) can't solve the problems of greed either but will exacerbate it.   Government initiates force with relative impunity. That is the difference.   Whereas capitalist logic sees accountability as harming the freedom of the owners of capital.  I just wrote about how accountability is essential.   Other people are just leeches on their success. And what is wrong with them buying and selling favors, when they are the successful ones and us the poor losers?  Is this an argument about how accountability is not essential? It is a straw man.   always give the advantage to whoever has the most money rather than who is wronged.   Always? What about reputation? Not between company and simple passengers, but in between companies. The insurance will suffer, the stock will suffer, any professional clientele of the company will feel like there may be less fairness if something goes wrong. Once people are accountable for teir assets, it is not smart to let another company manage them in any way that you won't be able to bring to justice in court. People who rely on that compnay for services will go elsewhere.   they still have to raise the money to begin with. Which most people cannot feasibly do.  The funds are high right now because of a barrier to entry and the incomprehensibility of the law.   anarcho-syndicalism  If you are denying property rights, then you are denying something basic to humanity.

[The role of soil organic matter in sustaining soil fertility](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v371/n6500/abs/371783a0.html)  [Environmental and Economic Costs of Soil Erosion and Conservation Benefits](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/267/5201/1117)  Fertilizers do not increase soil health, merely nutritional availability for plants. There is just as much erosion on an unfertilized field as a fertilized field - all else the same. Without the mycological and plant root structures, the microscopic pockets of air, the microorganisms... Soil is just dirt. Yields decrease and chemical inputs have to go up to compensate for both the lack of inherent nutrient and the increased amount of runoff pulling chemical additives away from plants.  [Here is a visual example](https://youtu.be/nhVWNwCRpKg?t=25m35s) at 25 minutes.  And don't even think about dredging rivers and ports for eroded soil and shipping it back to the fields. It takes billions just to dredge a 14 mile stretch of river with heavy deposits behind a catching dam.   Ok, I'll just google that I guess.    If Monsanto weren't allowed patent rights over GMOs, corn and sugar prices would drop like a rock. You don't get to just remove one arbitrary government interference and say "Look the free market supports me!" You have to remove them all.  If I wanted to sit here an list all the ways government affects the market...   Then stop using ancient farms causing desertification as an argument. You can't have it both ways.  Prove to me that plowing doesn't harm soil health and increase erosion.   They paid for it!  No, the consumer did. Every transaction in a market attempts to pass the cost of supply onto the demand. At some point in the chain of supply there is a wrinkle, like I said. Proper pressure is not being placed on the grower when he comes to the wholesale market.   Go find me proof plowing doesn't harm soil health or increase erosion.   Then try to think outside your box so that I may understand.  Is it a reference to something that an outsider might consider arcane?   Oh. I was asking a question about socialism, the type of a nation where control is managed by a state.  So in these inherent stages in the progression to complete communism: at this stage is the whole world under one government, necessarily?   First of all, cutting the land is *exactly* what we have been doing the same for 10,000 years.  Second, it doesn't matter if they didn't have science. We do, and we are measuring what those people did to their own land. Roman authors complained of the process as it was happening. They had writing, so maybe you can relate to that. David R. Montgomery has a slide from one Roman author in his lecture you can go find.   If corn and sugar were more expensive, it would make more healthy forms of growing more competitive. This would bring down the luxury charge on organic beef. Simple.  I am well acquainted with both the argument you are trying to make and the nature of pre-industrial farms. Modern farms are very different. Farmers and stock do not live in the same conditions, both are improved. Farmers use technology when it makes sense - such as automation, transportation, health, and various sciences. The fact that a farm does not offload bad costs is not a function of decrepitude of practices and conditions.  Better stated: they have no objective to avoid it because there is no cost to throwing it away. We will agree this is not a free market growers are operating in, and there are social trivialities being reinforced by other factors in the supply chain.    some people have more important things to care about.  Ensuring social order is done naturally in every society. It is done in plain conversation, in written opinion, and in art. It is done in prejudices and insults, as well. It is done in court precedent and in law. I suppose I am asking if a sizeable amount of people did not assume the norm and reinforce it (but maybe act with disdain for it - or malign it privately) would socialism break down?  And a more subtle question - if it can break down, what are people "reverting to?"    a society who practices self-defense against exploitative violence  So, how do they do that? Through the actions of the government only? Through voluntarily practicing? If you said no to the first and yes to the second then why did you not say yes to my question?    And if suppose it was true, how would it be any different for other social orders?   I do not understand this part of your comment and I would very much like for you or someone to explain it. Are there inherently multiple social orders in a socialist scenario?  There just seems to be some piece missing from the sentence to help it make sense in context.   You are confusing an aspect of socialism with what many think of communism, which is that it would have to be world-wide. Do you think socialism can only exist in a one world government scenario?   My spouse and I are using NFP, so we haven't gotten into the storm of issues around hormonal treatments.   Dude, you don't know we can take core samples of lake beds? There are ancient caches discovered all over the world preserved materials. Mortar in ancient structures and the ice in glaciers... All these places can hold pollen, seed, and dust samples which are hard evidence and dateable within centuries.  Besides that, the professor in the video (whose book I have read) mentions charts of data about half way through the lecture (at thirty minutes). These charts are made from modern studies on erosion. There are four sets, Agriculture, Mountainous, Soil-Covered Land, and Cratons (or extremely flat areas). I have listed them in order of maximum erosive potential. The most degrading agriculture ever measured was more erosive than a glacier scouring land. You know what dug the Great Lakes? Glaciers scouring the land. The chart does not show soil building, which can be measured separately but cannot catch up to the greater erosion rates. Even a forested hilltop will slowly crumble away.  I'm sorry for being insulting now. Would you like me to link you to youtube videos or National Geographic articles? I just got a thorn in my sole with conversing with you and I shouldn't have.    That's bullshit. Higher margins maybe, but the sheer numbers are not even the same order of magnitude.  Durrr, I'm sorry I'm so dumb. :P That's totally not what I meant./s Obviously. But in comparison it is extremely promising.   Not everyone can afford grass fed or USDA Prime you know.  ... we both know why they can't, if you're here - but still: Anything not grass fed is simply worth the cost of protein and fat chemicals available for ingestion and less than that for the undesireable content. Just because the economy is leaking like a seive to regulation and tax doesn't mean eating bad food is normal all of a sudden.  The population growth subsidized by the subsidization of industrial agriculature is a cost of statism as well - don't forget that. People make different decisions with different incentives.   You mean all farming.  There are farms which add value to anything they associate with. The air is clean, water runs clear, and the soil is healthy. People feel good there and the produce is superior. Open field monoculture negatively affects the value of everything associated - barring the produced goods.   When you figure out exactly how many units of each product will sell every day, you let the supermarket owners know. Until then, your contention that they are all somehow making the same mistake when they could destroy their competitors by improving is just silly.  With your determined lack of imagination, I must wonder how you can even comprehend the market. Truly - you are a boggling mass of writhing incomprehensions.  Edit: last bit is harsh and I want to apologize. My error of jumping to conclusions.   I'm not even blaming this shit on "climate science" and you're dismissing real data? How black is your pit?   No, there is no democratic accountability. That is a lie. Every politician but the rare exception either has a personal agenda or is bought off. - and if that does not weigh a decision the vote is up for trading for favors with others. If you meant regulation by departments, well, just look at the revolving doors at the executive level. The regultory departments are useless for controlling or prosecuting anyone with a fortune. No bankers, CEOs, or anyone else suitably connected goes away down the river.   (as opposed to taking everything to court which punishes the victims of these negative externalities with exorbitant costs for legal fees)  This is a simple tort reform issue where in some places a losing defendant is not made to pay the plaintiff's court fees.  The market isn't failing when it comes to negative externalities - the precedent has simply not had a chance to catch up to the science. In the days of railroads the companies were sued for starting fires with the sparks from their engines' smokestacks. After losing to ranchers, farmers, and old ladies the companies added spark catchers. We've come a long way since then but the government has gotten in the way of the courts.   Even small business owners do not want to worry about losing their house because something bad happened at their store or restaurant.   This fear exists because of both a litigious streak in modern society enabled by bad, morally relative, law and a loophole-ridden tax system which people use limited liability to protect themselves from (some, as they try to game the loopholes). But don't turn your nose up at the small to medium business owner who tried to loop a loop put there by a large corporation as a political lobbying job.   Capitalism requires this and other actions by the state in order to be somewhat stable, moral hazards and abuses be damned.  If we laid no hands on the free trade of goods, services, and ideas, people would be personally culpable to the actions of their company properties - including stakeholders - and systems would be available to address these matters and enforce them.   Organic farmers have just recently shown higher profits than conventional farmers.  Alternative methods include incorporating cover crops, using a seed drill instead of plowing, alleycropping, forest gardening, and grazing animals over the fields. Some organic farmers still use pesticides and herbicides but use ones approved by third parties to meet certain guidelines to protect the environment, farmer, and consumer.  Meat production is done industrially as well. When compared to well-raised meats, it is sickly, anemic, and has a poor nutrient profile. That is a cost on the consumer and supporting it in any way is a cost on the taxpayer.  Industrial farming generates other externalities in the environment, consumer, and farmer which are not costs passed on to the consumer. They are shouldered in various levels by everyone.  I don't advocate emptying buildings and ending business sectors and crap, but I do think that if food costed the true price we wouldn't waste a third before it reached the supermarket and not a small percentage after that. The landfills of California are filled with perfectly fine produce that simply didn't get sold at the right price. That is a large efficiency which means there is  wrinkle in the market that can be ironed out. I think government subsidies stand in the way.   There is substantial data on soil erosion by open field agriculture all the way back to the desertification of the fertile crescent. Our ancestors cut down all the trees and tilled all the soil until it ran into the rivers and silted them up, then once the land was purged of organic matter it stopped holding water to regulate rivers and became desert with flash floods. This happened in Greece, China, Asia Minor, the Tiber River valley, and almost happened in the American Colonies. Ur, Ostia, and Joppatowne were all ports - now they are 150, 20, and 3 miles inland, respectively.  Oh, and the cities buried in the Sahara were screwed by a change in the axis of the earth. Its there in the archaeological record.  [We understand its fucking insane to think the plow might have killed as many people as the state (in its many forms), but that is the case.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQACN-XiqHU)   Permaculture is a design ethos/method/understanding that lets you tie processes and entities together in a more innately productive way - starting at the bottom, usually. And usually the dirt floor bottom. How high it gets taken is another matter and it doesn't have to exist in a vacuum.

What he said resonated with me and I'm a pro-markets guy so there :) The Acton Institute is merely understanding of the worldly experiences and opinions Pope Francis has which color some of his statements in contemporary fashions which means there is every reason to disagree on certain points.   There is very little compassion in the way people conduct business, today. That is true. Nestle's water crimes and big oil's world-warping effects are extremes of scale - but not conscience. You can find the same cruelty of externalizing costs to society in every town and city. People think they are not responsible for the pollution and waste and poisoning of our physical and social space as they go about their jobs, but the people making decisions certainly are.  As a Catholic libertarian I want nothing more than to be able to tell people that limiting liability through a contract which relies on some government to stop responsibility passing onto the owners is ruining the market all the world over. Companies hide so much in beareaucracy and fed-propped national banks that there is no accountability and they are sucking up the money as fast as it can be printed. To quip: socialism for the rich. It works out quite well for them, though they enter into it actively, voluntarily, and with full control over the government - which is the only way it would work at any scale.  There is a philosophically classic view of humanity which defines morality and natural rights as they are described by the indeniable truths which relativism in all forms (not academically physical) strives to deny.

Certified Organic is known for not being the most natural. It is used by many people with more money than heart to buy into the Organic market without even having to stop spraying or paying their corporate sales reps. There is no reason Whole Foods' new program should be liable to simply stamp an OK on CO crops. Pay no rents, John Mackey, but why didn't you just start an independent certification business outright?  Here is the letter from CI: [PDF](http://cornucopia.org/Letter-to-John-Mackey-6-23-15.pdf)  Might very well be funded by people who don't like being called out on practices not as organic as they try to sell their crops or the companies that sell the chemicals and equipment. It is natural to complain about having to change practices to adhere to *another* set of standards - and CI is taking advantage of that to attach their less reasonable demands to.  It sounds like Whole Foods is trying to give their customers the ability to pay up front for what would otherwise be an economic externality on the farm side with this system. That isn't CO's goal.

August 25, 1814 in the early afternoon, a strong tornado struck northwest Washington and downtown. The severe  tornadic storm arrived the day that the British Troops had set fire to the Capitol, the White house and other public buildings. The storm's rains would douse those fires. The tornado did major structural damage to the residential section of the city. More British soldiers were killed by the tornado's flying debris than by the guns of the American resistance.  The tornado blew off roofs and carried them high up into the air, knocked down chimneys and fences and damaged numerous homes. Some homes were destroyed. It lifted two pieces of cannon and deposited them several yards away. At least 30 Americans were killed or injured in the heavily damaged buildings and an unknown number of British were killed and injured. (Lat./Long. = ...)  [NOAA D.C.

Satan can be a very seemingly real subjective projection of your ego in the right circumstances.    As for fictional characters, I would say Frank Underwood from House of Cards is one of the most Satanic characters in television in the last 10 years or so. He obviously has his flaws, but that's part of the equation. I'm still going through the first season so that may or may not change, but so far so good. Especially Season 1 Episode 3, a perfect application of Lesser Magic, and even Greater Magic (vis--vis mental projection of the Is-To-Be, see the Satanic Scriptures).   He was a powerful twentieth century figure that shaped the world after him, certainly. A black magician, possibly. But Satanist (de facto or otherwise), I wouldn't think so.   Yes, I'm going to take Reddit advice on what's customary from a rando with a whopping 1 Post Karma. Go troll somewhere else.    Pro-tip: Learn how the Post Link function works. Thanks for the feedback.      If there's some symbolism you don't feel comfortable or resonate with then you're free to discard it. No one should feel obligated to agree with everything every other Satanist does, enjoys, or is attracted to.       Yes, and no. I understand and appreciate the site's enthusiasm but some things may need some clarification.   1.  LaVey did search of occurrences of Satanism in his study of the occult. He references many materials dealing with devilry and Satanism in his books. Now what he was not able to find were genuine, proud, self-proclaimed Satanists. Prior to LaVey, the term satanist or satanism was a derogatory term for heretics or members of opposing religious faiths. Jews were satanists, the Catholic church was satanic, pre-christian pagans were satanists, etc. Now he was able to find some occultists with interests in black magic, but that wasn't enough. It's not enough for academics either. Keep in mind that LaVey was a self-taught autodidact, he didn't have access to university libraries and this was before the internet. But fast forward to today, and you have numerous occult and religious studies researchers trying to find historical Satanism. Funny enough, they arrive at just about the same conclusion. There are a handful of poets and occultists who considered themselves Satanic, but they have little to zero influence past their deaths. They reluctantly have to admit, and trust me some of these people have no easy feelings for LaVey, that there was no significant occurrence of self-proclaimed, self-identified Satanism prior to LaVey and the Church of Satan. Regardless of what some occultists want to think ex post facto, we're not talking about Yezidi, Gnostics, Thelemites, Pagans, Theosophists, etc. These are groups that may have some Left Hand Path influences but they did not and do not self-identify as "Satanic" or call themselves "Satanists", and would be insulted if you did for them.     2. I do not agree with the idea that not being in the Church of Satan makes you less of a Satanist. As far as I know, neither does Magus Gilmore. It doesn't make you more "independent" or "free-spirited" either though. And if you do not affiliate and go around trying to represent Satanism, then you're talking about a different ballgame.     3. "Pretenders To the Throne" was written as a response to certain materials published by the Temple of Set that claimed some form of authority over Satanism after their formation. While valuable for historical knowledge, it's an artifact of the past. Since then the Temple of Set has renounced Satanism all together and removed all claims over the philosophy and religion (after much internal debate, from my understanding). They no longer consider themselves Satanists in any way and only Setian. A more appropriate article to reference would be the [Satanic Bunco Sheet](http://churchofsatan.com/satanic-bunco-sheet.php), which is a guide to identifying pseudo-Satanic groups.   In short, yes, the Church of Satan supports the idea of magic.      In many cases, yes, LaVey's Satanic magic can be purely psychodrama and therapeutic. But that's not its limit. Our system of magic is completely carnal, materialistic, and we do not require our members to practice it if they are not interested. We tell those who are interested to be skeptical and remember that all experiences can be subjective. We use ritual magic to study and explore the limits of unconscious and conscious influence, and the possibilities of externalized projections of our egos and subconscious through bio-adrenal stimulation. None of this requires any belief in spiritual deities, demons, etc. We believe this to be an extension of natural human biology that is yet to be fully understood.   Gabriele D'Annunzio, H. P.

Tichenor, Malfew Seklew, Edgar Saltus, Arthur Desmond   Satan as a Jungian archetype is pretty much the whole idea behind LaVey's work, which was highly influenced by Jung. "Man and His Symbols" is practically required reading for anyone serious about the study of Satanism beyond what we in the CoS consider the "First Phase".  Peter Gilmore goes into this more in the [Satanic Scriptures](http://shop.underworldamusements.net/product/the-satanic-scriptures).      None taken, it's a valid question.

They are allowed to be official representatives of the Church of Satan. Yes, the title itself can be seen as a blasphemous play on the Christian Priest/Reverend, but we are fully aware that priesthoods, by that name or another, [have been around since ancient Sumeria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest). Christianity does not hold ownership of that word in any functional sense. As for "Reverend", that's more of a stylistic form of the role, and there's a history of non-Christian Reverends such as Buddhists and Jews.   I'm a reverend in the Church of Satan and have done numerous radio and media interviews. Will get in touch.   One of the things I'd like to do is elevate the material on this sub above the obvious material into deeper Satanic topics (philosophy, aesthetics, symbolism)    To the Junger-esque egoist Satanic Anarch a Hobbesian Leviathan would be an acceptable social system, it keeps the masses in place and gives him a suitable map to maneuver around. Either way, no matter what society you have in place, violence is the natural (Satanic) force that keeps it in place.   Who said anything about pointless violence?   Symbolism, misanthropy, and self-deification. All Satanic concepts. The author of those words and man being photographed is a former Reverend in the Church of Satan.   Because Satanism is about having a sense of humor and accepting the role of being the adversary. A couple years ago I was performing in Germany and noticed a guy in the crowd wearing this shirt and a Star of David necklace. I bumped into him later on, complemented him on his attire, and we started to talk over a few drinks. Turns out he was a secular soldier in the Israeli Defense Force and a CoS member. He totally got the point of the shirt and purchased a few of them for his regiment. Great guy.   This is actually more of joke on being Jewish than being a Satanist. Read up on Good Friday.    Also LaVey was pretty fond of the idea of throwing Christians to the lions. Bring back the Circus Maximus.    LaVey didn't just reject the Christian mythology, he rejected all of its values and morals. That's the point of Satanism, which some hand wringing kids now seem to miss. They'd be happy with and honest Christianity minus Christ.    This is actually more of a joke on being Jewish than being a Satanist. Read up on Good Friday.   "However, the willful submission of many inevitably creates a vulnerability waiting to be exploited by any one person who shrugs off social and ethical norms. If every man lays down his arms and refuses to pick them up, the first man to pick them up can do whatever he wants. Peace can only be maintained without violence so long as everyone sticks to the bargain, and to maintain peace every single person in every successive generation  even after war is long forgotten  must continue to agree to remain peaceful. Forever and ever. No delinquent or upstart may ever ask, Or Else What?, because in a truly non-violent society, the best available answer is Or else we wont think youre a very nice person and were not going to share with you. Our troublemaker is free to reply, I dont care. Ill take what I want.  Violence is the final answer to the question, Or else what?"      How does Ayn Rand read into any of that? Because it champions self improvement through will power? Much of their material is based on philosophies that are critical of Rand.       [Sitting by the pool in Vegas, weekend of greed, gluttony, and lust await.](http://i.imgur.com/NMwJbFk.jpg)   Yes.   Firstly, I meant no disrespect by addressing you. A quick search on your paper led me to your work with Leyba's art. He was an friend at one point and I have a collection of his work.    Alright, for the sake of this conversation, I'll accept 'political' as anything that promotes the idea of resistance, with media appearances and performances as examples.    With that said, my contention still stands. Media appearances and performances ramped up after Peter Gilmore took over the Church of Satan in 2001. The statement that I'm seeing pushed by TST and their supports is the that since LaVey's death a certain level of activity (political or not) ceased. That's stated as a factual premise on which other claims are made. I'm attacking that piece of the fundamental claim.     Between 1996 (LaVey's Death) and January 2013 (When the TST [first appeared as mockumentary film called The Satanic Temple](http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2014/07/satanic_temple_doug_mesner_cevin_soling_david_guinan.php)), I have on file (gathered from internet searches and archives) at least 20 interviews with Peter Gilmore. There have been at least 15 media appearances including The History Channel, Sci-Fi, Fox News, BBC, CBC, Point of Inquiry, New York Times, CNN, and more. His book, The Satanic Scriptures, was released in 6 different languages. But as we know, the Church of Satan isn't just Peter Gilmore. Our priesthood has continued operating on various levels including broadcast and online media (Radio Free Satan, which I operate, 9sense), book publishing (Underworld Amusements), clothing lines (ASP Apparel), and musical performers (too many to list). We've also had speakers at Center For Inquiry conferences, appearances on the Marc Maron podcast, Reason TV, done college and university lectures, and continued doing Satanic weddings (such as my own) and funerals. I'm not even going to count the 6/6/6 event in any of this.    I'll say this, if it's comes down between remaining under the radar and tea-bagging gravestones to grab headlines, we'll stay under the radar. Since 2001 we've had members running for public office, lawyers and fundraisers with various secular organizations, activists working with Wikileaks, speakers doing TED talks, speaking at SXSW   TechCrunch. Much of this isn't done by flying the Satanic banner. LaVey often told us to utilize the "cloak of invisibility" to achieve our goals. In my opinion, the real Satanic revolution will be one that no one notices.   While your succinct summation of LaVey's philosophy is accurate, I would like point out an inaccurate meme that you included, one that seems to be actively pushed by representatives of the Satanic Temple.    For a number of reasons, not the least of which was LaVeys death in 1996, the COS has ceased to be politically active     That's implying that the Church of Satan was at some point *politically* active. As an organization the Church of Satan, from its very beginning, was never politically active, even in a time of heightened political activism (late 60's, early 70's). LaVey encouraged individual members to pursue their own political aims that were Satanically influenced, but it was not uniform or centralized. In fact, LaVey rejected the idea of activism in the name of Satanism, or people using the Church of Satan to give meaning to their lives.     "As far as Im concerned, I would like my organization, the Church of Satan, to exist as a cabal for the mutual endowment of those already occupied with interests and activities other than organizational." - [Get a Life](http://www.churchofsatan.com/get-a-life.php)     Our current High Priest, Peter H. Gilmore, goes into more detail in regards to Satanism and Activism, how they relate, and why the Church of Satan has never been "political" in his article [The Church of Satan, and the paradox of individualist religion](http://www.churchofsatan.com/paradox-of-individualist-religion.php).      TST picks up from LaVey his idea of a secular religion using Satan as a symbol, but the similarities end there. The Satanic Temple advocates for an objective moral "good", to "encourage benevolence and empathy among all people." This is pretty much the polar opposite of LaVey's philosophy, which based on subjective morals.  Also, the 4th Satanic Sin is Self-deceit, not Self-defeat.      Read the Satanic Bible. It's a short book, shouldn't take you more than an hour. There's a whole chapter called "Indulgence... NOT Compulsion" in which LaVey advocates rational self-interest over mindless compulsive hedonism.  As for why Satan? Because LaVey recognized man's need for ceremony, for a religion that served his carnal nature. Satan represents this true nature of man, and the Satanist is the person who accepts this.  ""Satanism is based on a very sound philosophy," say the emancipated. "But why call it Satanism? Why not call it something like 'Humanism' or a name that would have the connotation of a witchcraft group, something a little more esoteric - something less blatant."    There is more than one reason for this. Humanism is not a religion. It is simply a way of life with no ceremony or dogma. Satanism has both ceremony and dogma. Dogma, as will be explained, is necessary. "       From Kevin Slaughter:    The equal symbol is not "owned" by any specific group of people, though various egalitarian groups/professional and voluntary victims have adopted it. The "NOT EQUAL" symbol is used as a rejection of egalitarianism, and has been used/promoted by various Satanists for decades. I printed up a bunch of "NOT EQUAL" symbol stickers in the late 90's/early 00's, as an example.  There is some incessant whining on a post promoting ASP Apparel design featuring the symbol. The majority of them can be summed up as "gays use the equal symbol, so using an unequal symbol is (or could be viewed as) anti-gay.  To imply that the Church of Satan itself, or a product it promotes is somehow "against gays" is to forget 50 years of Church of Satan history in favor of some knee-jerk reaction -- or worse, fear that someone may misunderstand you based on what amounts to a desperate attachment to small-minded jingoism, one most favored by those who fall into the camp of "Social Justice Warriors."  I would like to steal a few quotes from one of my favorite defacto Satanists, Benjamin DeCasseres:  "Curious that the uplift movement never raises the level of anything except human stupidity."   "There exists a 'general good.' It provides for the comfort and well-being of the greatest number of idiots at the expense of brains, culture and character."   "A catchwordSocialism, Progress, Democracyhas saved many a man from the gutter. A sublime enthusiasm differs in no respect from the exaltations of opium and alcohol, though the dreamer is infinitely more dangerous and asinine than the dipsomaniac and drug fiend. The drunkard enslaves himself only; the dogmatic enthusiasts always end by enslaving others. There is no maniac comparable to an active idealist."  "Discrimination is that fine sense that places the dead fish in one pile and the maggots that feed on them in another."  "What we call social justice is merely the machinery by which we regulate theft."      http://i.imgur.com/pevSPn4.gifv   Yes, Satanic magic can be purely psychodrama and therapeutic. But that's not its limit. Using LaVey's system many of us Satanists who are interested in ritual magic study and explore the limits of unconscious and conscious influence, and the possibilities of externalized projections of our egos and subconscious through bio-adrenal stimulation. This is all in a material and carnal context and does not require any spiritual or cosmological beliefs.    http://churchofsatan.com/faq-ritual-and-ceremony.php   The psychological power that can come from the use of politically charged imagery is not lost on us. My intent merely to point out the accuracy of the accusation within the context of ASP Apparel and Satanism itself. Whether or not it's a good or evil, right or wrong, is entirely subjective.       I have this on DVD and played it for a few friends in my home theater a few months ago. Incredibly poignant on the big screen.   As a non-Caucasian who has personally worked with ASP I can say that Nazism is one of the last things he cares for. He is certainly interested in heathen symbolism and a certain militant-bombastic flair, but I doubt Nazis would be happy about a line of clothes that celebrate the inherit anti-Christianity of Judaism. One of my favorite memories with ASP clothing is after performing in Germany I spotted a concert attendant wearing the Christ Killer shirt and a big Star of David. Spoke to him after noticing it, he was an atheist IDF soldier and Satanist. We had drinks and had a great time. A Hispanic and a Jew walk into a German bar and talk about Israeli firearms, while wearing clothes from ASP. How Satanic is that.            Don't get your panties all moist. Relax.    Sure, I'll dance again. The most common critique of LaVey's philosophy is it's non-universality. "If all people were Satanists then..."  We don't ascribe to that. Satanism applies to Satanists and benefits Satanists. LaVey's early work was a little more optimistic, but this diminished over time and can be observed in his later work.    But the "real politik" of the situation puts you at odds with the vast majority of people who will ever support you as a Satanist.    That's completely fine by me. I have no interest in being supported *as a Satanist*. I only care about the particular issue.    If we're talking about a Satanist Movement, then, you'd be doing more harm then good.    I believe OP was interested in a Satanist Movement. Outside of a specific set of circumstances, I'm not.     The vast majority of the people you say you'd give money to also want to make sure people like us never have a voice.     Ok. But if they're executing our goals then what's the problem? Identity and validation?     The rest of them are Libertarians who don't have a voice at the moment, and probably won't for a few generations    But forming a united Satanic Lobby that has the ear of influential public figures, even at a local level, is more likely to happen sooner? We're just speculating here but I think certain Libertarian or Libertarian-influenced policy makers have made great strides in issues that are of interest to me and other Satanists.    So give away your money to the wind with no advancement of your cause or your own personal power    What do you think my causes are? Groups I've supported have lobbied for the removal of the 10 day wait for firearms purchases, of which there's a hearing for in late April. ATF director has been replaced and there's push back on the proposed ban of green-tip M855/SS109 5.56 ammunition, which would raise the prices of other common AR-15 ammunition. Unions and social welfare programs are feeling economic and political pressure. Voter ID laws are being upheld. More and more states are legalizing and collecting taxes on marijuana. All of this is progress in my book, so I'm sitting pretty happy. Still much to be done.    if you fuck with the rest of us for your personal identity, you'll get what's coming    Oh, come now. Calm down. Not a good look.    I also doubt the only common ground would be separation of Church and State. That is a really lazy statement.   Eh. I suppose gay marriage and reproductive rights (even though LaVey made a case for a Pro-Life Satanist, instead promoting sterilization) might qualify. These are two issues CoS is more actively supporting through existing spheres of influence. Personally, I see such issues as generational, so while we should continue to support it, it's already gained much traction and it's more a matter of current politicians dying off.     philosophy about self determination on a personal level   For the Satanist, sure. Not necessarily universally.  The Satanist should consider if flying the flag does more harm than good for the issue they wish to promote publicly. If more progress can be made clandestinely, then so be it. My ideal Satanic Movement will be one that happens without anyone knowing it.     There's no such thing.   On August 8th, 1988 several Church of Satan members (at the time) and non-CoS members held a concert in celebration of the Manson killings 19 years prior. In their view the killings marked the end 60's hippie era. The artists used various Satanic symbols, including runes such as the Wolfsangel. The event was not an official CoS event, with LaVey declining his invitation. LaVey distanced himself from the event and several of the participants, and refused to acknowledge Manson, a criminal he despised, as some Satanic hero.    That said, the Wolfsangel itself is a valid and active Satanic symbol that we use in rituals such as the Rite of Ragnark and Die Elektrischen Vorspiele.   8/8/88 was not a CoS event, LaVey intentionally distanced himself from it and did not promote it.   [This?](http://www.catholic.org/saints/angels/angelchoir.php) Or not. The ONA was essentially a troll "honey pot" (to use the founders term) used to stir shit up and see who would fall for their nonsense. It unfortunately took a life of its own amongst a small group of angsty teenage metal heads who bought into it. Wouldn't be surprised to see it being monitored in one way or another.   Are you searching based on price? Just being realistic, because if 80k used is all you can afford then you may be in for shock once maintenance bills come in. Wouldn't recommend that for a first car.         Because someone just mashed up the Satanic Cross with an inverted Yr/Algiz rune (death rune) and a Wolfsangel.    A few months ago I witnessed a "Mr. Helpful" just pop up behind a guy doing squats to help him align. Startled him and he nearly dropped the bar behind him. Guy told him, in not so nice terms, to back off. Broke up before gym staff arrived.   I've implemented Freshbooks/Freshdesk projects successfully for similar clients (music/record label) and have heard nothing but positive feedback.      If you want to contact the Church of Satan you're better off asking the [unofficial Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/thechurchofsatan/). Many of the people posting here are not in the Church of Satan or follow the Church of Satan's philosophy. Asking a public, open Reddit group for the demographics of a specific organization is probably not the best way to get valid research data. If you want more specific information than the unofficial group I linked to PM me.   Shot one last time I was in a Vegas range and had me considering adding it to my collection. Seems like the weight counter balances the recoil.      Some of our Magisters hold no "jobs" and make little in terms of income, but have beautiful homes and have a wide range of influence in their spheres. We have members who are international celebrities but hold positions lower than newer members. So, no. straight up money or time don't really buy you much.   Reminds me of an observation I once either read or discussed with someone on the measure of wealth based on what one lacks or yearns for. The lower classes measure wealth based on money. The middle class on education. The upper class on influence and freedom. Not universal, but something I've come to understand and notice from time to time.   Ah yes, that's more my liking. Was looking to purchase Fall 2015 but might hold off and put some cash aside for a nicer trim on an XE in 2016 if that's the case.      Check the listings here.

We all want pretty much the same things for how our society is organized, and we should rally around that commonality. It's part of what unites us all as Satanists.    Disagree. Just being a Satanist, of any sort, is of little consequence to me or the issues I'd support. I would (and have) put my money into a lobbying groups that support cuts to government spending or gun rights faster than an open Satanist group looking to promote liberal social welfare programs (as I've heard some group say they would). I think the one and only common ground would be on separation of Church   State.   Did you read the Blanche Barton's essay on revisiting the program? http://churchofsatan.com/five-point-plan-revisited.php   Shrug. As with all things, it's all about the results.   We already have Satanists involved in politics. No, they are not "openly" Satanic, and being so would be inherently un-Satanic. A realistic Satanic politician would probably campaign as a Christian to gain maximum appeal, but push policies that go against Christian ideals and implementing Pentagonal Revisionism, such as eliminating social welfare, minimizing federal spending, upholding the death penalty, supporting separation of Church and State, and decriminalize drug abuse. Sound familiar?   Nice. Will start modding mine after I put a few hundred rounds through it to get a good feel of what I want to do.   Elevation is granted based on real-world accomplishments and demonstrations of applied Satanism. We don't care about memorizing quotes, statements or rituals. We want to know how things are going with your career, art, education, or creative projects. I was made Warlock after I took over Radio Free Satan and published articles in print and digital magazines. Years later I was made Reverend after helping with several CoS projects and accomplishing substantial career goals. PM me for details on how to get in touch with Central.   I would also say that LaVey was more antitheist than some of the most militant atheists nowadays. He was not happy with just co-existing with other theists, he would have pushed for its complete eradication.      "Satanism is not just an atheistic stance but a anti-theistic stance. We prefer destruction of mystically-oriented religions through active opposition rather than simple non-participation. - Secret Life of a Satanist: The Invisible Revolution   The relationship between the atheist "community" and LaVey's philosophy has been mixed. While Satanism at its core is functionally atheistic, it goes a step further and posits that man himself is a god. LaVey was hesitant of using the word "atheist", since that would be the complete rejection of god or godhood, which isn't exactly the Satanic perspective. Each Satanist is his/her own subjective god, and this isn't something taken lightly. One may even project or communicate with this god during ritual (keeping in mind that this is purely a materialistic psychological, mental exercise, not a spiritual one).      That's where many capital "A" Atheists tend to breakaway, especially within online communities where Atheism is taken more as a social cause and strongly held identity that not only includes a disbelief in deities but also disbelief in things like the supernatural or psi, which do not necessitate the belief in deities or spiritualism.    What's funny is while many of those Atheists on the ground level, such as forum commentators, have a hard time with Satanism, we at the Church of Satan have long had strong ties and relationships with Atheist/Secular organizations at a high level, including members and associates. For example, we held our 6/6/6 Satanic Mass at the headquarters for the Center of Inquiry in Los Angeles. We've had High Priest Peter Gilmore on [Point of Inquiry](http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/), Magister Kevin Slaughter has presented at several seminars as part of SkeptiCamp and Center of Inquiry, and we've co-promoted with the American Atheists on issues such as separation of Church   State. We've also had various members on university atheist radio stations and newspapers.   It's the same media that keeps referring to civilian AR's as "automatic machine guns".       Great work!      Everyone here should continue this discussion with their favorite barista at their next visit to Starbucks.     It has NOTHING to do with Classic Satanism / Theistic Satanism    Sure, because no such thing exists. I'm sorry, but academics and occultists have looked and there has not been an established philosophy, religion, or doctrine called **Satanism** prior to LaVey. The best people have been able to come up with are various unorthodox Christians (who would not considered themselves Satanists), pagans (again, would not have considered themselves Satanists), and blasphemous non-believing poets. And in each case they were small flashes in the pan. Funny, how many threads have there been on this sub asking for primary texts or sources for Theistic Satanism? I think I see one at least once a month. And what's the usual response? At best, a link to a webpage that doesn't source any primary texts and hasn't been updated in 20 years. But usually something along the lines of "theistic satanism is a personal pursuit, you make your own path and private relationship with blah blah blah..." In other words, there's no tradition, just look for stuff in any religion that sounds evil and make shit up and claim that as some form of legitimate "spirituality".     Boo hoo. Nobody cared back in the 1990's and even fewer people care now.    The whole Satanic Bible plagiarization claim is old news. Yes, LaVey borrowed from other writers. Big deal. He didn't hide any of this. In the early days of the Church of Satan LaVey showed his copy of Might is Right to his close friends and it was no secret that he was influenced by it. He included a Redbeard in his list of dedications in the first printing (To: Ragnar Redbeard, whose might is right). Big fucking whoop.    As for LaVey "paraphrasing" Rand, that's such a stretch that it's hilarious. He was influenced by Rand, of course. He took bits and pieces of Galt's rambling speech and turned them in Satanic words of wisdom. Great!    And no, he didn't get his Enochian from Crowley, he got it from John Dee. And he actually changed that around to fit the Satanic feel as well. In fact, one can say Crowley "borrowed" it more directly from Dee. Someone call the fact checker!    As from Zeena   Schreck's bullshit, that stuff was dismissed as obviously slander. What's not mentioned is that at the time of the publication Zeena   Schreck were struggling to get control of the Church of Satan and its assets, so they conjured up as much dirt as they could, true or false. Much of it false, with key people rejecting those claims (Karla, Stanton, and even Zeena herself would later recall things differently). Was LaVey the perfect husband and father? Probably not. But that doesn't take away from his philosophy, or even the character that he was.   Friendly dog goes up to one cop and gets petted, goes to greet the other cop who's scared of his own shadow and murders him point blank.       Here's a fun exercise. Replace your logic for the dog's breed with a human race and see how that sounds.    No, [pit bulls are not known to be any more unpredictable than any other dog](http://pets.webmd.com/dogs/features/pit-bulls-safety?page=3). That's just ignorant fear mongering. They cannot just easily take off a man's arm.    I think there's been a lot of progress made by Satanists and non-Satanists in the AI/Robotics industry. I look forward to future developments.       I've been stopping into just about every shop in San Diego and [Honey Badger Firearms](https://honeybadgerfirearms.com) is by far the best.

His prices are the lowest in the area and is dedicated to customer service. When I picked up my rifle he showed me how to properly field strip it, clean it, and attached the sling. He even replaced the bullet button (side switch instead of underneath) for no charge.    Here's an article by Blanche Barton on education and schooling:     [Mandatory Education: Teaching Pigs To Sing](http://churchofsatan.com/mandatory-education.php)   Here are some helpful articles from Church of Satan Priestess Lydia Gage from her Satanic Parenting magazine (out of print)     [IGNOR/ance: the Root of the Problem](http://churchofsatan.com/ignorance-root-of-problem.php)     [Encouraging Magical Concepts](http://churchofsatan.com/encouraging-magical-concepts.php)   Don't need to get into a sociological/political tangent, but I wouldn't say Hobbes was anthropologically disproven. Much of his criticisms come from socialist/anarchist writers, who seem to ignore that Hobbes would see small clans as lust/carnal concords.     That said, some Satanists I know would agree and prefer small, well defined and defended clans.    Those wars would happen regardless. Whether or not those executing the wars are doing so on Satanic principles is irrelevant. I mean, ideally, sure, but that won't happen any time soon.      The way I see it, Satanism is a tool. You use Satanism to accomplish other things in the real world. The Satanic Bible is the owners manual. Some people already know how to use the tool, they've got an natural talent for it. Others need a primer, and beginners guide. But once they got that down, they'll move on and build things of great person value.    Peter Gilmore addresses this paradox in this interview: [The Church of Satan, and the paradox of individualist religion](http://www.churchofsatan.com/paradox-of-individualist-religion.php)    "Satanism empowers Satanists to be the center of their own subjective universe, their own gods so to speak, so it is their personal values and desires motivating their activism or any other pursuits, not Satanism itself. It is important to note that Satanism is not a cause, rather it is a set of principles that serve as a tool for each Satanist to get the most out of life. So activism in the name of Satanism is meaningless, since there is nothing that can stop one from employing the principles of Satanism as a personal tool for survival and prosperity. "     Hello, Church of Satan Reverend here who has studied LaVey's system of magic for several years.   LaVeyan rituals are purely atheistic, just a form of psychodrama...       In many cases, yes, LaVey's Satanic magic can be purely psychodrama and therapeutic. But that's not its limit. Using LaVey's system many of us Satanists who are interested in ritual magic study and explore the limits of unconscious and conscious influence, and the possibilities of externalized projections of our egos and subconscious through bio-adrenal stimulation.     I don't understand what he means when I say I lack respect and that I'm naive.     From a Satanic perspective, I would ask; do you have any guilt or doubts? Ouija boards are often projections of your own fears and desires, either conscious or subconscious. Take it from there.      Kind of useless to determine what's "correct" when it comes to Enochian. The Golden Dawn system by MacGregor Mathers was a re-interpretation from Dee's source, which was inconsistent and disorganized at best. LaVey used the Keys because of the psychological, dramatic impact they would have on the practitioner (he confirms this in his forward to "Might is Right"). From a Satanic perspective, it doesn't matter if the Enochian is "accurate", it only matters that it works (drives bio-adrenal energy). What difference does it make if the language you use is accurate if you don't believe in the the beings that this language is said to communicate with?    My stomach loves you for this thread. My wallet, not so much.      The symbol is the alchemical symbol for sulfur/brimstone, which LaVey incorporated. The nonsensical "prayer" is overlayed on John Dee's Sigillum Dei, which was a Sigil used to communicate with/control Angels, only if you have a divine connection with God.     So this doesn't make a whole lot of sense and serves only to act spooky and ignorant.    Correction: /u/mindmaster064 is right, this is Frater Achad's personal sigil, not the Sigillum Dei. That said, the idea is similar, communication with angels, etc.   As someone whose cat was also a door darter I'm relieved to hear the good news. We've trained our little guy by giving him a treat at his favorite sitting spot before we go out. When entering we open the door slowly, if he's peeking out we jingle the keys loudly and scoop him up.  Over time he now rarely comes out to the door and is easily handled.   How do you talk with people about your beliefs when you know they don't have the same one? Do you talk with people about it at all?    I don't. The only people that know about my beliefs are other Satanists or people who are already familiar with Satanism. And even then I very rarely talk *about* Satanism directly. It's an understood common ground. But we will talk about movies, music, art, books, guns... all of which are influenced by our Satanism, so there is that indirect connection.     Remember the First Satanic Rule:    Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked.    Match that with the understanding that you have no obligation to be "honest" with strangers or people who will give you a hard time.            You're not going to find any temples of "Lucifer" in biblical times because there was no such thing as "Lucifer" in those times. Current ideas about Lucifer being the Fallen Angel actually comes from a typo. The original King James translation of the Hebrew  (Isaiah 14:12), which means "shining one, morning star", was translated to "lucifer" in about 1604, lowercase, not a proper noun. This was an error and was corrected in later translations. In reality a lucifer was someone was brought light or knowledge. Jesus was called "a lucifer", John the Baptist was a lucifer. So it was a descriptive term, much like the Hebrew word "satan" was a term used to describe an enemy or adversary, not a proper noun. So the original Isaiah 14:12, which is the source of the whole Judeo-Christian mythology of a man, who rises like the morning star, to overseat the throne of god, and fails, was actually a reference to a real-life Babylonian king, most likely Nebuchadnezzar II, **not an angel or being**. ([source](http://books.google.com/books?id=Yf-BVeN6TbIC pg=PA34 lpg=PA34 dq=Dempsey+%22king+remains+obscure%22 hl=en#v=onepage q=Dempsey%20%22king%20remains%20obscure%22 f=false)) So if you were to go back to biblical times and start talking about Lucifer people would look at you funny and say, oh you mean the local teacher? Huh? (Edit: Actually, in biblical times they would have no idea what you were talking about as that word did not exist at all. My scenario would fit in the 1600's when the King James Version was being made). It was only much later, such as the King James Only movement, that Lucifer was made a proper noun and identified with the figure of Satan. Then came the *fictional* works of Paradise Lost and Inferno that expanded on the allegorical symbol of Lucifer. **So I repeat, "Lucifer" did not, at all, exist in any way shape, form, or idea, in biblical times.**  Trivia: a famous early Christian bishop was named Saint Lucifer of Cagliari. His followers were called Luciferians, they were devout, fanatical Christians who opposed Arianism. Arianism was heretical form of Christianity that rejected the holy trinity. You could say Luciferians were the original fundamentalist Christians, and they have nothing to do with our current idea of Lucifer/Occultism/Satanism.    As the FAQ states, the Church of Satan is open to the possibility of magic as a naturally occurring carnal phenomenon. That said we do not require our members to "have faith" or even interest in this topic, as we prefer interested individuals to experiment themselves and remain skeptical.    Surely a religion that claims godlessness and earthliness has no need for theistic rituals and invocations.    Who said anything about those being theistic rituals and invocations? LaVey's system of magic requires no belief in any external gods, devils, demons, spirits, etc. All experiences, if any, are subjective and even LaVey himself stated that even in his most powerful workings any personal manifestations are purely the externalization and visualization of his own ego and material/carnal desires.     "I have this awareness that the objectification is in accord with my own ego. Im not deluding myself that Im calling something that is disassociated or exteriorized from myself the godhead. This Force is not a controlling factor that I have no control over. The Satanic principle is that man willfully controls his destiny; if he doesnt, some other mana lot smarter than he iswill. Satan is, therefore, an extension of ones psyche or volitional essence, so that that extension can sometimes converse and give directives through the self in a way that thinking of the self as a single unit cannot. In this way it does help to depict in an externalized way the Devil per se. The purpose is to have something of an idolatrous, objective nature to commune with. However, man has connection, contact, control. This notion of an exteriorized God-Satan is not new." [Monologue from John Fritschers Popular Witchcraft by Anton Szandor LaVey (1973)](http://www.churchofsatan.com/interview-popular-witchcraft.php)    [Also from the Church of Satan FAQ on rituals:](http://www.churchofsatan.com/faq-ritual-and-ceremony.php)   WHAT IS A SATANIC RITUAL?  Greater Magic, which is our name for our ritual practice, is basically meant as self-transformational psychodrama. That is it serves as a means to purge oneself of unwanted emotional baggage that might be hindering a daily pursuit of joy in life. We do not require that anyone accept that it is more than this. The pageantry of ritual is a drama meant for emotional stimulation, not a belief in or worship of any power higher than the projected will of the magician. That is why we call it an intellectual decompression chamber.  The three basic types of Satanic Ritual are outlined in detail in The Satanic Bible, which is essential reading for those wanting to grasp our perspective on this practice. They are for Compassion (for oneself and others), Lust (to release unrequited sexual urges) and Destruction (to cleanse oneself of anger towards someone who has done you an injustice). These serve as models for whatever other purposes one might feel the need to explore via ritual. In The Satanic Rituals Anton LaVey presents other rituals essentially meant for larger group performance based on historical and cultural diabolist imagery.  However, some Satanists also consider the possibility that, through the raising of emotions focused towards a specific achievable goal in ritual, ideas/concepts/images might be transmitted to the minds of other people at a distance, thus perhaps influencing them to make future decisions favorable to the outcome of the situation desired by the magician (transmitter). It then seems to us plausible that there would be a means that is part of nature through which this works. It is not attained through the intervention of supernatural beings, as we do not believe such things exist. The desired goal, what we call an Is-To-Be, would vary based on peoples' ability to transmit as well as receive such images as well as the likelihood of the situation towards which the magician is working.  Rupert Sheldrake, a biologist, has spent many years exploring the extended mind and has solid statistical evidence that there indeed does exist a mechanism in nature that could be used for such ends. His many books are fascinating and worth investigating.  We emphasize that the philosophy of the Church of Satan does not require that our members believe that ritual is more than an emotional experience, nor is there a mandate even to ritualize at all. We simply offer it as a tool for experimentation. Some folks have found results that they feel are beyond coincidence or statistical parameters. Others simply enjoy the release of emotions otherwise hindering their pursuit of personal happiness.  There is no judgment placed on members of the Church of Satan regarding their personal understanding of how ritual functions. One is not more or less of a Satanist based upon his or her evaluation of Greater Magic. See the essay, On the Role of Ritual in the Life of a Satanist by our High Priestess, Magistra Peggy Nadramia, for more information.          Undefiled wisdom, indulgence, vital/carnal existence, the balance of love   hate, bringing vengeance on your enemies, responsibility for your actions, rational self-interest and elitism.    ["What does Satanism mean to you?" (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzlOtvDFjx0)   Dimitri posted a direct response to the news. Seems to be getting a better reception than the PR release from a few days ago.  http://aresarmor.com/store/NewsArticle/Letter-to-Customers   Looks like this happened sometime after Jastin's death ([source](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/2li47v/thank_you_for_your_help_unfortunately_marine_gun/)). There's a lot of financial, emotional, psychological pressures on Dimitri and I hope this helps ease some of it.         /r/satanism   I've had some experience with Voodoo many years ago, and found it... interesting and dangerous. Warlock Kenaz Filan is an extremely experienced Voodoo practitioner and wrote the following article on [Satanism and the Afro-Caribbean Traditions](http://www.churchofsatan.com/satanism-afro-caribbean-traditions.php)   From Secret Life of a Satanist:    Indeed, far from preaching sexual or political anarchy, LaVey describes his goal as the creation of a police state in which the weak are weeded out and the achievement-oriented leadership is permitted to pursue the mysteries of black magic.   I don't see much of an issue here from a moral point of view. The only issue is matter of convenience. That aside, the Satanist should be able to embed itself into such a system and maneuver themselves around such obstructions. How non-Satanists feel or are affected is not much of a concern. Actually, LaVey advocated this because it would lead to the weeding out of the weak amongst the masses, and at the same time give the herd the kind of state it so much wants and yearns for.    "In fact, honestly, from the atheistic perspective, what exactly is the difference between Satanism and Humanism aside from aesthetics?"    This is like saying, well what's the difference between Islam and Mormonism? Both believe in a higher power and established religious laws. The only things Satanism shares with Humanism is the goal of a secularized government and using rationality as the basis for decision making. That's it. Core to humanism is the belief in distributive justice, altruistic morality, and building human communities based on objective ethics. This is not Satanic, at all. For example, a humanist would see human life as objectively valuable, to be preserved at all costs. A Satanist would say no, the value of life is subjective to the individual, and can be measured in terms of productivity, creativity, and strength of will. And it's up to them to defend it. Eugenics is a core goal of Satanism, something incredibly taboo in the Humanist worldview.   Honestly, either you've communicated with some pretty lousy Satanists (600 club being a hotbed of that) or you're just not content with the answers provided. I'll address your points but it's clear to me that there are some fundamental first principles we will disagree on.    "But, Satanism and people's connotations and understanding of Satanism existed well before 1966. It has always meant someone who aligns with, works with, or in some cases "worships" Satan."   You say this as a given. It's not. There are [numerous](http://www.academia.edu/2050005/The_Devil_s_Party_Satanism_in_Modernity) [religious](http://www.academia.edu/2768697/2008._Rites_of_Autonomy_An_Examination_of_the_Rituals_of_the_Church_of_Satan_Undergraduate_Honours_Thesis_Dept._of_Religion_Concordia_University) [academics](https://books.google.com/books?id=f1t_BAAAQBAJ) writing [extensively](http://www.academia.edu/2540808/2012._Satanists_and_Scholars_A_Historiographic_Overview_and_Critique_of_Scholarship_on_Religious_Satanism_Master_s_Thesis_Dept._of_Religion_Concordia_University) about the history of Satanism as a mobilized movement and this is not an entirely agreed upon claim. Did the terms "Satanism" and "Satanist" exist prior to 1966? Absolutely. But under what context? Almost entirely it's been used as a condemnation, a derogatory term against those who go against the religious norms or orthodoxy of the time and place in which it's being used. Cathars, Gnostics, Catholics, and Protestants were called Satanic or Satanists, does that make it so? Then of course the Jews were considered Devil Worshipers, along with any indigenous pagan cultures. Even in those rare cases where someone openly considered themselves a "Satanist" or Devil Worshiper, they always operated under existing theological paradigms. A "Satanist" was merely a witch, pagan, or someone interested in the occult. That's all, and always it's still calling for the angels, the power of Christ, etc. Whenever the Devil or demons were conjured, it was for material, carnal rewards, but *always* fell back on salvation, outside of fictional works. And then there are those who other people called "Satanic" but they themselves rejected the term as an insult (Crowley, Blavatsky, etc.). Even the most ardent scholar that has tried come up with an established historical Satanism prior to LaVey has had to give on this: LaVey's philosophy was the very first to openly and proudly formalize a religious paradigm called Satanism that exists on its own. It has its own aesthetics, rituals, dogmas, doctrines, culture,  metaphysics, and traditions.  From "Contemporary Esotericism" by Egil Asprem, Kennet Granholm (from the Gnostica academic series of papers and publications): "LaVey has described how he looked for Satanists before founding the Church of Satan, but did not find any. This is similar to how Graham Harvey speculates that Gerald Gardner searched for "traditional Witches", but without much success. Eventually, after the founding of Wicca, others stepped forward and proclaimed they, unlike Gardner, were in fact truly traditional Witches. Exactly the same thing happened in the case of Satanism."  "If one does not believe in Satan..."   We do, as the balancing force of nature, and as the externalized projection of our Egos, that if powerful enough, may be projected in the minds of others. Our Satan goes back to the original Hebrew term, which was bastardized by the Christians.   "metaphysics..." We do have our metaphysics. I don't think you understand the term, as it doesn't necessarily involve "spirituality". We have quite a few members in the hierarchy of the Church of Satan interested in exploring the metaphysical works of Heidegger, and topics such as metaphysical naturalism (yes, I'm aware of the conflicts between naturalism and Dasein, and this is something worth pondering).    "By identifying as a Satanist, you are CHOOSING to be misunderstood, aren't you?" Maybe for now, even though this is becoming less and less of an issue. "The first hundred years are the toughest". Consider this, Christianity took over 200 years before it became a barely accepted term. We're looking long term, very long term.  LaVey didn't spend time defending his philosophy in his books, he spent that time establishing and expanding on it. His interviews covered this more thoroughly, and he also delegated that responsibility to Reverends in the Church of Satan.  	126

 "You are depressed?! Good!"  EO(3:)B      It always makes me think what those people think it is about the age of consent that somehow magically makes fucking someone who was 15 the day before when it was "wrong by most people's moral code" absolutely OK the next day? (age of consent is 16 in many countries, mind you) Fucking a 9 year old (let alone a toddler) would, I think, be "wrong by most people's moral code", but the claim that with 15 year olds it's the same is just silly.   Of course it's not real.    It's amazing how Reddit always hops on subculture hate trains. I am not a furry, but I don't see anything wrong with furries.   I'd imagine that some cities weren't affected at all (except by nuclear winter). There would be some mutants, but nothing worse than before.   I don't know if interesting, but quite embarrassing - when I was in primary school, one winter day I and my classmate were going to wait for the public transport and we somehow thought it would be fun to throw chunks of frozen snow in front of passing cars. We kept doing it for a few minutes and then a policeman came from the nearby police station (it was in fact next to a police station) and warned us not to do that  It was incredibly stupid.

As always, at first sight 60fps is butter smooth and you get used to it, so it doesn't even seem so after while.

I have never read manga, but NHK deals with such an interesting theme (I am fascinated by phenomena like hikkikomori; besides, I hope I do not become one myself - though I do not know if a westerner can become a real one, as the societal conditions are different from Japan -, as I do not go out often and most of my free time spend on PC) and the anime had some really good messages that I should consider reading the manga just for the sake of filling in all that was ommited.       thank   I am not that fat yet.   Not *too* young, tho.      Ayy, Vietnam flashbacks!   The thing is that the religion virus preys on naturally selected human characteristics like pareidolia, superstition, pattern-recognition abilities (these three got a lot in common), the drive to protect offsprings, the self-preservation instinct, and other things.  You gotta train and educate people in critical thinking and skepticism to recognize inborn human fallabilities, whereas faith and religion thrive on the lack of these things.  It's a hard fight, and it may be that some form of religion always arises and it is thus virtually unweedable, but it is worth trying to get people to be more reasonable, because it brings progress.      Who the fuck beats birds?   Yeah, that was priceless.

 I have a [Maxnomic from the same company](http://www.needforseatusa.com/computer_gaming_chair_leader_black) (which is supposedly even higher end than that chair in the pic).  I have never had buyer's remorse worse than I have with this chair.  In fact I am saving up money to replace it even though I have had it less than a year.  If you want to buy mine I'll sell it cheap but I feel bad doing that.  The chair is a massive let down.  It ticks the boxes on a list but that is about where it ends.  The cheap desk chair I got at Costco for less money was far more comfortable than this chair.  Seriously...this chair is among the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever used and, like most people, I have used a lot of different ones.

Problem is he is looking at a punch-out hole (i.e. the plane was not going in there but coming out).  You can tell by debris in front of the hole.  The wings were of course completely stripped off by that time.  A missile would not create a neat punch-out hole like that either.  It'd just blow up.  Further, even *if* you want to think a missile flew through there no missile in the US is that big.  That hole could fit and ICBM in it.  That hole is WAY too big for a cruise missile (a Tomahawk cruise missile has [a diameter of 20.4 inches](http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=2200 tid=1300 ct=2)).  You can see a better picture of it in my previous link along with a description pointing out pieces of debris: http://www.rense.com/general32/phot.htm  And if it was a missile weird to have landing gear and wheels among the wreckage which can also be seen in the photos at that link.    Not a whole lot of mystery here.  Look at the Germanwings crash and you see a line of wreckage.  Makes sense, the plane was moving forward when it hit causing wreckage to be strewn in a long line.  Well, that line at the Pentagon goes *through* the Pentagon itself.  All the wreckage is inside the building.  Even if the plane hit the ground outside the building (which it barely did) the pieces would be moving forward at 300+ MPH into the building.  Given the nature of the concentric rings at the Pentagon there was no way the plane would come out the other side into the center.  Further, the Pentagon had been undergoing improvements and was being hardened to better resist attack.  The plane managed to hit a part that had already been hardened.  In short, the plane going 300+ MPH got shredded passing through multiple reinforced concrete walls.  Here is eyewitness testimony and photos of the wreckage inside the Pentagon: http://www.rense.com/general32/phot.htm    I object to her running unopposed.  I'd like Warren in there if for no other reason than to force Clinton into debates and make Clinton commit to policy stances.  I want an election, not a coronation.    As an aside it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth that we may get a Bush/Clinton election.  Smacks of the presidency being hereditary.    This is what Indiana is trying to accomplish.  They want to give legal cover for discrimination under the guise of religious beliefs.       is infringing on multiple copyright owned by my clients  The notice is poorly written making it seem dubious.  Among grammar issues there is this inconsistency:  *"...is infringing on multiple copyright owned by my clients..."*  and  *"...with the reasonable belief that rights my company owns are being infringed."*  So who owns the copyrights?  The person writing that notice or his/her clients?  I understand it is best for you to get your own lawyer to be sure but this seems bogus (especially considering, as mentioned, you do not host any of this material).    What the supporters of these laws are saying is that Ollie's BBQ[2] and the Heart of Atlanta Motel[3] should have had the ability to deny service to black people back in the 1960's.  That is pretty much [exactly what some are arguing](http://www.cato.org/blog/indianas-defense-religious-liberty) although instead of coming right out and saying that they dodge and weave behind high-minded rhetoric and use the constitution for cover.    If your religion prevents you from doing your job then you need to choose a different profession.   The B2 first flew in 1989.  Perestroika started in 1986.  I guarantee you it took longer than three years to design the B2 (in fact it was approved in 1981 and there had been considerable research into stealth aircraft even prior to that going back into the 70's).    I'm going to guess you are young.  The way the US "won" the cold war versus the Soviet Union was we out spent them.  Literally.  They were always trying to play keep-up with the US so they had rough military parity.  The B2 and Star Wars among other weapon systems were simply things the Soviet Union could not afford but they tried anyway.  It lead to the collapse of the Soviet Union.  There was more to it than just that but it was a big part of it.  You can argue whether the money spent by the US was worth it or not but in a sense the B2 defeated the USSR without firing a shot.  Just the threat of it was enough to goad the Soviets into spending far more than they could support.      ...this sucks for the Indiana fans who have nothing to do with this stupid-ass "religious freedom" act.  Well, they vote (or should vote).  They should work to get the creeps running the state thrown out so laws like this don't get passed.    I agree.  I know it has been said already many times.  Just adding my $0.02.   Yup, the smell is basically bacteria poop.  Sweat by itself has no odor.  It is worth noting that different bacteria live on different parts of your body so the smell coming from other sweaty areas (e.g. your crotch) is different than that coming from your armpits.    U2   There have been a number of scandals recently that have plagued the Secret Service.  They used to be thought of as consummate law enforcement professionals and instead have shown shocking lapses in judgement.  - [Lawmakers investigating allegations that two senior Secret Service agents drove drunk through an active bomb threat investigation at the White House](http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/24/politics/secret-service-investigation-clancy/)  - [Drug Enforcement Administration agents in Colombia who allegedly engaged in "sex parties" with prostitutes hired by local drug cartels also arranged for paid sex for at least two Secret Service agents traveling to the country to protect President Obama in 2012.](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2562119)  - [Secret Service Agents Booted From Obamas Europe Trip After Drinking](http://time.com/38093/secret-service-drinking-obama-europe/)  - [Secret Service missed man with gun in elevator with Obama](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/exclusive-secret-service-missed-man-with-gun-in-elevator-with-obama/article/2554185)    At [3:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded v=1ePhMj47SEY#t=187) he talks about putting roasted tomatoes on the pizza.  Call me crazy but I am pretty sure he is adding red and yellow pepper slices.  Add to that his bullshit that the pizza in New York or Chicago and he can be written off as a crap (he says there is no good pizza in America...for all our faults we do pizza better than anyone not counting Dominoes).  Yes I know he is a successful chef and restaurateur but that is a patently false statement.  Even if it is merely his personal opinion it just shows he is either full of shit or just trying to sell his pizzas (which are good too but barely deserve to be called a pizza).    As you sow, so shall you reap.  That said we do not really know what the relationship is here (it may be the granddaughter is a bad person) but the assumption is grandma is getting her comeuppance.    Remember that on a typical home connection your upload speeds are substantially slower than your download speeds.  For example you'll be getting 40 mbps down but 5 mbps up.  Of course those numbers are not promises so there can be a good deal of variability in them.  Now the OP said they were getting 30 kbps.  We do not know enough to get any conclusions from that.  There can be myriad reasons for that speed.  Make no mistake, I am no fan of Comcast but there is little reason to suppose they are blocking you.    I use Comcast and I actually do a lot of uploading for various reasons and I regularly check the speeds.  Comcast is delivering what they promise (for me at least).  That does not mean you aren't having problems or that Comcast is dealing fairly with you.  It just means consider alternative possibilities.     The US has an extradition treaty with Italy so the chances are very good she would get extradited.  It is not enough for the US to just disagree with a verdict.    It is possible the US may try to prevent that on human rights grounds suggesting Italy's prisons are so bad putting her in one would violate her human rights but that is a reach and it is unclear whether the US would want to go that far.   32-bit systems can only address 2^32 bits of RAM (about 4GB).  That is total memory in the whole system (video card, RAM mainly but whatever else too).  So, if your video card had 1GB of VRAM then your system was left with 3GB of RAM that could be accessed regardless of how much was installed.  a 64-bit system can address 2^64 bits of RAM.  In theory that comes to 18.2 exabytes of data but in practice it is less than that.   The one downside to this is the small amount made per go (enough for two dishes give or take).  Usually not a problem though unless you are cooking for a lot of people.    Perhaps the amounts can be increased for a larger batch but I have not tried that.  If anyone has let us know how it went.    Thanks.  This is easily my favorite cooking "trick".  I had wrestled with Hollandaise in the past.  This method is awesome and really works (just be sure your butter is the right temp and pour in to the mixer slowly).  SO spent the night and you want to wow him/her with breakfast in bed?  This technique will certainly help.    Could this be any less colorful if they tried?  Mechanics seem interesting but there is more to a game than a gimmick.          I smoked for 25+ years.  I quit cold turkey two years ago and have not had one since.  If I was there I'd definitely ask her for a cigarette.     Great video.  Always enjoy these.  Surprised he didn't mention the ultimate Gatling gun though.  The [GAU-8 Avenger](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/GAU-8_meets_VW_Type_1.jpg) on the A10 Warthog.  It's even [been in video games](http://www.amazon.com/A-10C-Warthog-PC/dp/B005KQ99O2) so would fit with his theme.  Also it has seven barrels instead of three or six.    Cherry-picking or not, the people interviewed are people participating in these protests and do represent a segment of the protestors.  You cannot hand wave this away though.  The issue is a group (in this case True Revolt) is trying to paint a picture that all black people in Ferguson are aggressive.  It is in the title, "Black community's feelings on white people in Ferguson".  This is not "black people's feelings".  This is a few idiot's feelings and there are some to be found in any crowd.  If you keep asking enough people questions you will get a handful of crazy...welcome to the world.  To then drop all the reasonable answers and compile the crazy answers and then post it as how a community feels is incredibly deceptive and dishonest.  More than that it is trying to aggravate and motivate people against that group through dishonesty.  So are there some black people in Ferguson who are seriously pissed off?  Sure!  Of Course!  It should come as no surprise to anyone.  Do those firebrands represent the community?  No.  They do not.  Trying to portray the whole in a bad light because someone cherry picked a few bad apples is bigotry writ large.    I am not sure what you mean by "useless".  Tutorials are meant to familiarize the player with the game's mechanics.  After that it is up to the player to learn the game on their own.  Usually the game starts off relatively easy to allow for the learning curve.  What else would you want?   Inside you may be wearing less or lighter clothing.  You also may be more sedentary when inside (e.g. sitting and working on your computer).  Outside you are more likely to be wearing heavier, weather appropriate clothing and more likely to be active (walking somewhere) which generates body heat.  Additionally, radiant heat if the sun is shining on you can warm you.  Stand in the shade on a 65F day and you will likely feel it to be much cooler than in the sun.   Has no one taken note of who produced this video?  There is a distinct air of cherry picking in the video.  A little work shows us that [Truth Revolt](http://www.truthrevolt.org/) is a project of the David Horowitz Freedom Center which is a far right organization distinctly hostile towards African Americans.  The Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch blog has described it as a far-right organization.[6]  Chip Berlet, writing for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) accused Horowitz of blaming slavery on "'black Africans ... abetted by dark-skinned Arabs'" and of "attack[ing] minority 'demands for special treatment' as 'only necessary because some blacks can't seem to locate the ladder of opportunity within reach of others,' rejecting the idea that they could be the victims of lingering racism."[22] Responding with an open letter to Morris Dees, president of the SPLC, Horowitz stated that his reminder that the slaves transported to America were bought from African and Arab slavers was a response to demands that only whites pay blacks reparations, not to hold Africans and Arabs solely responsible for slavery, and that the statement that he had denied lingering racism was "a calculated and carefully constructed lie." The letter said that Berlet's work was "so tendentious, so filled with transparent misrepresentations and smears that if you continue to post the report you will create for your Southern Poverty Law Center a well-earned reputation as a hate group itself."[23] The SPLC replied that they stood by the accuracy of the report,[24] and subsequent critical pieces on Berlet and the SPLC have been featured on Horowitz's website and personal blog.[25][26]  [SOURCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Horowitz_Freedom_Center#Criticism)  These videos are heavily edited.  You can make it seem that [Americans don't read books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yiCyjRgXw0) with these sorts of videos.  They are edited in a way that cherry picks to desired responses and everything else hits the cutting room floor.     I'm with you.  For 2015 this looks like shit.  I mean really, horribly, terribly like shit.  I would expect this in 2000.  Everything about it screams half-assed, cashing in on a name.  The graphics are astonishingly and astoundingly bad.  Something I'd expect from an 8th grader just staring out learning 3D animation.  Don't get me wrong.  I loved Carmageddon waaay back in the day but this seems to not improve a thing and it's been 17+ years.  There is HUGE potential for this game but this just squanders the whole thing.  Like some guys phoned it in and hoping for a paycheck before people realize they didn't do shit.    ...left people clambering for a replacement.  I know we shouldn't be pedantic about this stuff here but honestly trying to help and I think in this case it is worthwhile.  The word you wanted is "clamoring" and not "clambering".  Clambering = To Climb  Clamoring = To shout loudly/vehemently  That said I was not confused for a moment about what you meant and I agree with you.    Russia did sell their nukes...to the US.  For the past two decades, 10 percent of all the electricity consumed in the United States has come from Russian nuclear warheads.   It was all part of a deal struck at the end of the Cold War. That deal wraps up today, when the final shipment of fuel arrives at a U.S. facility.[SOURCE](http://www.npr.org/2013/12/11/250007526/megatons-to-megawatts-russian-warheads-fuel-u-s-power-plants)  The program was called [Megatons to Megawatts.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatons_to_Megawatts_Program)    Despite treaties there was real worry of Soviet era nukes finding their way on to the black market.  The Russians were not exactly on top of the situation and there were a lot of disaffected Soviet era scientists and military types and such that were out of work and might have nabbed some nukes to sell given the chance.      The production costs of the F-35 are almost exactly the same as the Eurofighter ($100 million each, approx), except:  Err...not really.  A single Air Force F-35A costs a whopping $148 million. One Marine Corps F-35B costs an unbelievable $251 million. A lone Navy F-35C costs a mind-boggling $337 million. Average the three models together, and a generic F-35 costs $178 million.  It gets worse. These are just the production costs. Additional expenses for research, development, test and evaluation are not included. The dollars are 2015 dollars. This data was just released by the Senate Appropriations Committee in its [report](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/R?cp113:FLD010:@1%28sr211%29) for the Pentagons 2015 appropriations bill. [SOURCE](https://medium.com/war-is-boring/how-much-does-an-f-35-actually-cost-21f95d239398)   Considering you could get two 980's and run them in SLI for only a bit more money (extra $140 give or take) the 980 will give you far better bang for the buck.  HOWEVER:  If you do video editing in a big way then the Titan is the way to go.  Video rendering programs like Adobe's products will not take advantage of SLI.  As a result a fast, single card is the way to go.  You can see it in the Titan's specs.  12GB of VRAM is massive, massive overkill for games.  You'll never come close to using it in a game for the life of the card if you bought it today.  The VRAM is there for video editing.  This card is really meant to be a single card solution for people who want to do fairly serious video editing and play some games when they are done.  If you want a card for gaming a 980 or 980 in SLI will be a better buy.  If you want serious video editing (real serious) get a Quadro card.  Will not be good for games though.  Want both get a Titan.   I saw this whole episode and interestingly everything has its price.  In the case of owls they bought their stealth at the expense of waterproofing.  Their feathers do not shed water.  They get soaked instead.  As a result owls are grounded when it rains.  If the rains continue a long time that can become a real problem for them.    Not sure why but the link in the OP now goes nowhere.  Here is the same story:  http://news.yahoo.com/france-aims-criminalize-advertising-anorexic-models-155422346.html        Also, if we started jailing witnesses for giving testimony that doesn't match the facts, who in their right mind is going to come forward as a witness?  While no one may voluntarily testify under those circumstances the court can and does regularly issue subpoenas compelling someone's testimony.    You can "tut-tut" them for their poor queuing skills (the British being world champs when it comes to queuing).    Nah.  Things are worth what people will pay for it.     I have **never** had a cable repair guy come to work on my connections who knew more than I did.  I have **never** called cable tech support and dealt with a person who knew more than I did.  And I say that noting my networking skills are pretty good but not exceptional.  Their workers are trained to put the square peg in the square hole.  If that doesn't work they are lost and will invariably blame it on something else or blame it on you.  I once had very intermittent and slow connection speeds.  Over the course of three months I had five or six techs out to see the problem.  They ALL saw the problem.  They ALL agreed it was not my fault.  They ALL agreed I should be getting a substantially better connection yet NOT ONE ever resolved the problem (that was on DSL...switched to cable).    The commodities market is a price discovery mechanism.  If you do not do it that way how do you figure the price of a barrel of oil?  It'd be a mess and certainly more expensive than it is when on the open market.     The actual rebuttal to this proposal is if you make it so women face (say) 35 years for falsely accusing a man of rape then women will almost never come forward and admit they lied in the first place.  It is hard enough to get a woman to admit to falsely accusing someone.  If she faces a harsh prison sentence she'll swear to her grave the guy did it.  So sure, you will catch some false accusers with no admission from them but a helluva lot more guys will rot in jail for 35 years instead of 19 months.  Which is worse?  Woman admits to lying and guy falsely accused goes free or you stick it to the liars and most men falsely accused get to rot in jail for the rest of their lives?  tl;dr Careful what you wish for.  You just might get it.    Actually the open market is the most efficient way to price commodities.    Part of the reason it amounts to a regressive tax on the poor.   More a history than current politics but very interesting (I think) and certainly explains some things today.       He mentions he Alienware gave him a good deal on the system.  So, while maybe not free for him there was some promotional consideration. At a guess (if those are GTX980s he has) that system retails for $4000.  No question it is a nice machine but that price is stupendously expensive.  Joe says building your own PC might save you a few hundred dollars.  I am willing to bet you could save $1500 and build a machine just as good.       I am pretty sure if you do a chargeback with Steam they ban you for life.  I *think* you can keep playing the games you already bought but that is it (not positive about that).    Why did this get downvoted?  Did the OP rip off the idea from someone else and I missed it?  Sometimes (often) Reddit confuses me.   Have you ever had sex with a woman?  It tends to be moist and slippery in there (assuming she is turned on).  Lube helps replicate that feeling.  There is a reason [Fleshlight's use lube](https://www.fleshlight.com/lube-and-care/) (NSFW) and it has nothing whatsoever to do with being circumcised or not.  Same idea with your hand and lube.  That said not everyone uses it.  Personal choice but it has little to nothing to do with circumcision.    I'd buy a couple (preferably from OP).    If games go this way this could revitalize brick   mortar game shops.  People who cannot download the game in a reasonable time or are stuck with data caps could go to a store, buy the game and take it home on a thumb drive.    You could either buy your own thumb drive to use for this or the game store could loan it to you (with a suitable deposit and/or fee).  As long as they were reasonably cool about it and didn't try to rape people for the "service" in fees it may well be a means to get people back to the shops.    Someone needs to send them copies of The Hindenburg movie.    Sysadmin here.  Not sure where you work but in my world of Windows PCs everything runs fine.  Everything runs as it should.  I can't remember the last time anything crashed (I really can't).  Had one PC six months ago that was inexplicably slow, re-installed the OS (after other trouble shooting didn't work) and everything was fine again.  It is a regular part of my job to evaluate new software and hardware for our business and so far everything has run fine (the product may not have delivered what we wanted but had no troubles getting it to run).  Well...once I had to go find some DLLs for some software but that is about it.  You need to talk to your system administrator and have a long talk with them.  Sounds like they are dropping the ball bad where you work.   That's not why they use lube.   The mom agreed to the procedure two years ago then decided to go all drama queen about it and fight it.  No one is considering the trauma all this drama is having on the kid who is now on the run in a shelter with his mom but hey...as long as she avoids the circumcision for the kid it's all good because nothing could be worse than being circumcised.    Here is a good review of the game that notes its strong points and shortcomings: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR_WZVk58ZI  While it lacks a few things SimCity has overall it has it where it counts and, in my view, is superior almost across the board.  That and the asking price of $30 makes it a must buy.  Unless you dislike the genre (it is more sim than game) it is hard to go wrong with this.  Bonus: It runs buttery smooth.  I have not yet built a huge metropolis but so far not a frame rate drop worth mentioning or crash in sight.  Seems rock solid.    What SimCity should have been and $30 for it makes it a no brainer.  Bought it as soon as reviews were out and I saw the price and happy to give them my money.  EA can go pound sand.    It *may* be a balance issue but I'd be willing to bet most times it is done to meet framerate marks.  If less stuff is being drawn on the screen they can say it runs at 60 FPS and put that in marketing materials.  I am a person who gets nauseated/headache at low FOV settings.  It is literally intolerable for me to play those games.       [Harold   Maude.](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/harold_and_maude/)    Yeah, it is about depression in a way but it is hilarious and makes depression funny.  There's more but would be spoilers.  Do yourself a favor and watch the movie.    He implies a reduction in lending is proof that the bailouts didn't have a positive impact on the economy. However, the relevant part is how lending developed relative to what would have happened without the bail-out. That makes me question the accuracy of the rest of the claims there.  Is the economy "better"?  On paper it certainly is.  Thing is the Fed absorbed all the toxic assets from the banks.  Basically removed the crap debt from the bank's balance sheet to the Fed which = taxpayers.  The American public now has the crap debt and cannot really get rid of it.  All that crap is still there, it hasn't gone away.  More risk free investing for banks.  Basically invest in high risk, high return vehicles and when it all goes to shit unload the debt on the government because you are TBTF.  They privatized profit and socialized risk.  Neat trick.    He is right.  Discount window are overnight loans.  Basically Bank-X is short money because while it loaned out X-dollars it has not collected enough to cover it.  The bank on paper may have IOUs (e.g. checks) that says it has the money to cover everything but the transfers have not happened yet.  The bank then takes an overnight loan from the Fed to cover everything.  This is normal and usual business practices.  Nothing creepy or untoward about it.  I mistakenly said the discount window.  That said the Fed DOES loan banks money in other fashions apart from the discount window and the banks do get sweetheart deals.    Here is some further detail (article is from 2011 so "newly-released" isn't accurate anymore):  A newly-released study from the Congressional Research Service bolsters claims that the nation's largest banks profited off the Federal Reserve's financial crisis-era programs by borrowing cash for next to nothing, then lending it back to the federal government at substantially higher rates.  The report reinforces long-held beliefs that the banking system in essence engaged in taxpayer-financed arbitrage: They got money for free, then lent it back to Uncle Sam while collecting juicy returns. Left out of the equation are the millions of everyday borrowers, like households and small businesses, who were unable to secure loans needed to tide them over until the crisis ended. [SOURCE](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/26/fed-lending-helped-wall-street_n_853884.html)     Personally, I've been arguing for a decade that the best solution is for the federal government to just print the money rather than pretend to borrow it.  This results in inflation.  Witness Zimbabwe which did this.  You can now buy $100 trillion (yes, trillion with a "t") Zimbabwean bank notes on Amazon for about $40.  ([kidjanot](http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8 keywords=100+trillion+dollar+zimbabwe tag=googhydr-20 index=aps hvadid=31590361237 hvpos=1t1 hvexid= hvnetw=g hvrand=11723665018106217136 hvpone= hvptwo= hvqmt=b hvdev=c ref=pd_sl_4ckt965o83_b))  Post WWI in the Weimar Republic in Germany they had so much debt (war reparations) they started printing money willy-nilly.  This spurred hyper-inflation.  The exchange rate got to 4,210,500,000,000 German marks/US dollar.   The Fed can and does print money to some extent but they have to be very careful about that.     It is a backhanded subsidy.  The really big banks get lower interest rates when they borrow money.  They can go to the Fed discount window and borrow money from the federal government on a short-term basis.  The current interest rate at the Fed window is 0.75% (I think).  They then take that money and buy federal T-Bills or Bonds.  Those instruments have a higher interest rate than 0.75% which means, basically, free no-risk money for the banks.  Essentially the banks borrow money from the government at a low interest rate then loan the money back to the government at a higher interest rate.  Only the big banks can do this.  You, me and community banks aren't allowed.   From what I have read she has not violated a law.  The laws were tightened up and it would be illegal now but wasn't when she did this.  Still shitty of her and an astonishingly bad move on her part.  I am not surprised people in her position want to do it this way but amazed she was dumb enough to do it.  I thought she was more politically savvy than that.   While they are both amazing I think Ricky Jay is more impressive with the [card tricks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LYjMHzQ_oU)  There are moments in Lennart's act where I suspect he is doing "something".  Some slight-of-hand.  I have no clue what he is doing and it is still impressive but I never see that with Ricky Jay.    For me it was G-Sync.   The ELI5 answer is Libertarians believe government should be as small as possible and individual rights should be as broad as possible.  This does not mean no government nor does it mean unlimited individual rights.  The merits of this system (as with any political system) are of course open to much debate.    This is wrong on several levels.  - A server does not ask you a question. - There is not a "super rare" chance to get a Bitcoin.  If you are the first to solve the problem you get the bitcoin. - Confirmation of transactions is a whole separate thing from mining bitcoins.  That gets into how bitcoins are used. - If you get a bitcoin it does not go to a "mining computer".  EVERYONE who participates in bitcoin transactions has a complete copy of all bitcoin transactions ever made.  A transaction is deemed ok when enough of these bitcoin wallets agree it has happened.   - There is no server rewarding you for anything.    GPUs are specialized hardware.    Think of your CPU as a small room with a handful of scientists in it.  They can complete almost any task you give them.  They are very versatile.  A GPU is more akin to a really big room filled with dumb people.  They cannot do complex tasks but can do simple ones.  For instance, add 1 to the number you get and pass it to the next guy.  Sure the scientists could do it but there are not a lot of them.  The room filled with dummies all doing one simple task repeatedly is much faster than the scientists would be.  This massively parallel computing is well suited to particular tasks.  Mining for a bitcoin is one such task that leverages the strength of a GPU.  A GPU is much, much faster than a CPU at doing this sort of problem solving.  That said bitcoin mining on a home PC is pretty much useless these days.  Dedicated bitcoin mining shops are in operation that use hundreds or even thousands of computers using custom built hardware.  Your lone PC doesn't stand a chance and in fact you'd lose money since a PC working that hard draws a fair amount of electricity which you will have to pay for.    To generate ("mine") a bitcoin your computer needs to find a solution to a particularly difficult math problem.  The problem is a cryptographic problem so the only way to get a solution is to repeatedly try many solutions till it finds one that works.  Once one is found it is registered with the bitcoin network.  Everyone who has a bitcoin wallet on their computer will verify the new bitcoin add the new bitcoin to the list.  Once a bitcoin is mined the math problem becomes even more complex for the next iteration and so on.  In this manner the rate at which bitcoins are "found" is regulated to a predictable schedule.  Mining bitcoins has long since passed out of the realm of desktop computers.  There are dedicated bitcoin setups out there that leverage the use of hundreds or even thousands of computers.  Your home PC simply cannot compete.    Yes, Comcast would like to do this.  This is what Net Neutrality prevents.  And yes, Netflix uses a lot of bandwidth BUT you are already paying Comcast for that bandwidth.  You are buying (say) a 50/10 connection from Comcast.  What does it matter what data you pull through that connection?  You are *already paying for it*.  Further, Netflix pays for massive data connections to their server rooms.  No one is getting a free ride here.  Comcast just wants to charge Netflix extra because they can.  Comcast is not providing anything extra.  Just for a price they agree to not slow them down.  Comcast is trying to hold Netflix over a barrel because Comcast controls the last mile (basically the connection to customers' homes).  They want to act as a gatekeeper deciding what data gets through and what doesn't (or what data gets delayed and slowed down).  So, for instance, Comcast owns NBC.  They decide to stream NBC content and full speed.  ABC?  CBS?  TBS?  They can all get slowed down OR pay money to Comcast to be allowed through.      The remarkable thing is how good her feathers are for insulation.  She is warm yet the snow on her is not melting.  Wish the insulation in my house did as well.     The first words in that article:  Lasers have staggering range...  No they don't.  You can stop reading right there.  Lasers have shit range. A mile, as stated in the article, is not "staggering range" in anyone's book unless you are talking about man portable weapons (and sniper rifles can do that).  This cannot be man-portable.  They don't show you how big the laser is but a generator capable of producing the [30 kilowatts of power](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/37463/20150305/lockheed-martins-athena-laser-can-disable-vehicles-a-mile-away.htm) it takes to run this [weighs in at around 1000 pounds.](http://www.norwall.com/products/Generac-Commercial-30kW-1.5L-%28Steel%29-208V-3-Phase.html)  Don't get me wrong, it is cool as hell.  Just saying Engadget needs a writer with a clue.          Why waste time ranting on and on about the shortcomings of a game that is generally viewed as terrible or that you didn't enjoy.  Because game developers/publishers seems to be adopting a model of game design that is increasingly about how to maximize getting money out of your pocket rather than making good games.  Making games shorter, selling more DLC, being more cookie-cutter than fresh and new (putting out the n^th sequel) and emphasis on flash over substance like a Michael Bay movie...the list is long.  As long as they can make money doing this they will keep doing it.  I do not know who is all buying these games because apparently they never read reviews.    Aside from that it was pretty generic as far as shooters go.  Define a "generic" shooter?  I am not trying to be snarky.  I am genuinely curious (really).    What made this one a generic shooter?  What are examples of non-generic (and presumably good) shooters?   Iran doesn't get to decide this for itself.  Eisenhower started the Atoms for Peace program under which various states would be given a nuclear reactor by the US for power production.  These states otherwise would not be able to build one of their own.  As part of this deal they signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons:  Iran is a party to the NPT but was found in non-compliance with its NPT safeguards agreement and the status of its nuclear program remains in dispute. In November 2003 IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei reported that Iran had repeatedly and over an extended period failed to meet its safeguards obligations, including by failing to declare its uranium enrichment program.

Black hair = pointy chin  Red hair = broad chin  Black hair = broad bridge of the nose  Red hair = thin bridge of the nose  Black hair = full lips  Red hair = thin lips  And of course all the other stuff like skin tone, hair, eye color and so on.  I am not seeing anything near a close resemblance on any level.  I would swear they have different fathers (is that technically possible with humans "twins"?).    The solution is obvious.  Whether you want to go there only you can decide.  I've been where you are.  I suspect no amount of advice will help.  You have to learn the hard and painful way till you find someone who does treat you right.  Then you'll wonder what the fuck you were thinking.  Then you'll come to Reddit and give the same sage advice to the next tortured soul and they'll ignore you too.  Some things I think have to be experienced to really be learned.  Painful as it may be.  Keep the faith.  The person for you is out there and chances are you'll find each other someday.       You've got it wrong.  Do the things you do because you *want* to do them for the other person.  Do them expecting nothing in return.  If your SO does not treat you they way you want to be treated then you need to have a long talk or you need to break up.  Making lists of who did what and comparing them and getting mad that things are lopsided is a recipe for disaster.    Repetition.  If you have a list to remember (say vocabulary words for a foreign language) don't try and cram the night before the test.  Make a list of ten or twenty and read them everyday.  Don't "try" to commit them to memory.  Just read them once or twice a day, every day.  You'll start to remember them naturally.  If it is math then do a handful of a given set of math problems every day and solve them.  Rinse and repeat.  Read five pages of your history book then re-read those pages the next day.  And so on...  This way it barely feels like work and you absorb the material better.  Adjust as necessary to meet your workload.    Partially true.  Betamax had superior video and audio to VHS but Sony monopolized it so there was very little variation in models and features and it was a lot more expensive than VHS.   If that is so serves them right.  They could have stood with the teachers but chose not to.  They'll get what's coming to them when there is no one left.    My sister and I were a classic sibling rivalry.  When we grew up and she got married and had kids my guiding light for gifts for my niece and nephews was shit that made noise.  Sometimes you've gotta play the long game...    This is one of the reasons I love Reddit.  People dropping in and filling in the blanks.  Wish I could give more upvotes.   What is interesting is the ONE union he has no problem with is the police union.  He knows he needs someone to protect him when the public has had enough and decides to camp out on his lawn.    I did that but without micro they managed to get in front of the asteroids again.  I just sucked it up and moved on.     Dunno why but wish I could upvote this more than once.   I shouldn't laugh but I did.    If you want to be a pedant (which I will) they got her name wrong.  To be fair most everyone does and it seems she just gave up the fight and rolls with it.  Her last name is pronounced "Thron". (Like "Tron" but with that "h" in there.  It's South African so comes from/pronounced in(?) Afrikaans.)  Don't take my word for it.  [Take hers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3TTi_gAS5c)   EDIT to add: Hearing her talk in Afrikaans makes her even more sexy which is quite an achievement.  Also, Piers Morgan who is interviewing her in that clip is a doofus (to put it mildly...there is one Brit I wish stayed in Great Britain).    While not quite the same thing I remember something similar with my nephew.  I think he was four or five when his parents figured out he had a semi-severe vision problem.  He wasn't blind but his vision was really poor.  They took him to get glasses (and these were coke-bottle type glasses...very thick).  On the ride home they said his eyes were wide and he was silent.  Just staring at a world he had never really seen before.  I wish they had videoed it but sounds like the look on this kid's face.  Just that "whoa!" moment.    OP wants the [Death Blossom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=MLNvUsTBGyE#t=118)  (you young people missed all the good movies)   I played Homeworld when it came out and it remains one of my top five games of all time.  While there is no doubt Gearbox did a smashing job on the re-master my feelings for the game are those of someone who played and enjoyed it 16 years ago.  I am curious how those new to the game see it.  Is it all it's cracked up to be or something less?   Had a 12 hour flight home about a month ago, bumped into this random badass russian dude in the airport in the smoking section whom I bummed a cigarette off of.  Was it [The Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHfroJBMlVM)?      When you are ten one year is 1/10 of your life (10%).  When you are fifty one year is 1/50 of your life (2%).    There is nothing new or unusual about federal regulations preempting state law.  That said it is a point of regular contention in the courts over the years.  All that is to say it is neither automatically right or wrong.     Awesome.  Now it goes to yet more litigation.  Hopefully it'll win there too.    My PC was just re-built a week ago, fresh install of everything. 8GB RAM, GTX-980, game runs silky smooth.  On Mission #4 I am getting a crash.  It happens different times but always a ways in (after the Bentusi).  Usually (it seems) as I capture Ion frigates.  Getting annoying because I cannot seem to get past this mission with that crash.  Guess I have to save scum to do it.    Yes.  Update.  At least it sure seemed that way to me.    Yeah, download the DLC (which came with your purchase...it's the original games) to play the campaign.    I installed the game via Steam as normal and immediately jumped in.  I had no problems but decided I wanted to play with headphones on so I exited the game, setup my headphones for surround sound awesome and went back in.    Steam then downloaded another few hundred meg update.  Dunno what it is but it's there.  Probably worth doing before you get too far.  It is not very big so shouldn't take too long.    I forgot to do that :/  Fortunately I have a fast broadband connection so not too painful but still...   This is one of those special games that just sticks with you.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did (I suspect you will).   If you ordered the collector's edition and have not received the box yet Gearbox is will try to help you: https://gearboxsoftware.zendesk.com/entries/62587454-Amazon-Collector-s-Edition-Not-Delivered-by-Feb-25    I remember having to slowly plink away at one ship at a time, retreat, repair and do it again.  Took me hours.   I'm excited for a new generation of gamers to get to play and experience the Homeworld games.  As has been stated many times (here and elsewhere) Homeworld, despite being over 15 years old, holds up remarkably well.  It simply has not been equaled in all that time and remains a high water mark for the RTS genre both in its gameplay and outstanding story all delivered with a high polish.  To those wondering if it is worth your money I would say definitely.  You really cannot go wrong unless you simply do not like the genre itself.  If you do like this genre this is one of the all time best.    Do yourself a favor and play this.  Unless you just hate the genre this is a great game.  For me this is in my all-time top five favorite games.  For years I would go to GOG in hopes of finding it on there.  It really is outstanding.    I sincerely hope this does well and they consider doing Homeworld 3 (or re-building Cataclysm from scratch).  Whatever...we just could use more of this.  Sadly the actor who did the cut scene narration and Bentusi (Campbell Lane) passed away so he'll be missed in any new Homeworld game.  He really helped set the feel/tone for the game.    Lawyers are way ahead of you:  - [Nvidia hit with class-action lawsuit over graphics card RAM issues](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/02/nvidia-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-over-graphics-card-ram-issues/)   We've recently been cruising the http://www.meetup.com website and gone to a few gatherings.  Were they the "best" date ever?  No.  But they were different and so far they have been fun.  With a little time I think they could be great fun.  (Meet new friends too)  EDIT:  To the OP - Do you live in a big city or small city or the country?  Your options are limited by your location.  For instance I live in Chicago.  Taking her mountain climbing really isn't going to happen.   I *think* [Tantric Sex](http://www.askmen.com/dating/love_tip/43_love_tip.html) might be a start but there is a lot of mysticism wrapped up in it.  So much so I hate pointing anyone at this but some swear by it and it seems it might be something for you.    Remember though your partner may or may not be on board so keep that in mind.   Eat vegetables.    Nitpick:  1.5 years but yeah, bullshit.  The game was supposedly [built in parallel and not a port](http://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV_PC/comments/2swhgj/is_gta_v_pc_a_port_or_a_parallel/) but even if it wasn't I thought the new "next gen" hardware was supposed to be close to a PC in a box so as to make cross-platform programming a breeze.  I figured the delay of 1.5 years was to milk the hell out of the console market and then sell it on the PC market because let's face it, few would buy the console version if they had a quality PC version to get instead.  This delay of a month I doubt is to refine the "port" any more.  They'd have had to have been asleep at the wheel for over a year for that to happen.  It was probably ready to go a few months after the console release.  My guess is the game market for the PS4/XBone sucks.  There precious few killer games for those systems.  Nearly everything has been a let down.  As a result sales for GTA5 have remained stronger than they expected since it is probably still the most worthwhile game to get for those systems.  They figure they can make more money delaying the PC release.  It'll wait and make them lots of $$$ even another month late.  Best to milk the next gen market awhile longer.    Me too.  Weirdest release time I have ever seen.  Usually releases happen on Tuesdays and usually unlocks at midnight EST (New York time).  This is weirdly random.   Also, there are a HELL of a lot of people who don't give a shit that it's supposedly only 6 hours long. Myself included. I'd be happy with a shorter narrative game that looks beautiful. I already have a backlog that's longer than I want to even think about. I don't need another ridiculously long game to add to that.  So for their next title you'll be even happier with a four hour game that is two hours of cut scenes and two hours of quicktime event gameplay as long as it looks good?  How low can they go before you you think $60 is too much? (honest question)  And how big of a backlog can you have on your PS4?  (honest question)   The silver truck is clearly spinning his wheels.  I do not think traction control would let that happen.   Here's something more straightforward.  Doom came out in 1993 and of course computer gaming has been on the rise since then.  [Violent crimes in the US peaked in 1994 and have plummeted since then.](http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/crime_rate.gif)  Correlation does not equal causation but if people want to say that computer games increase violence then they need to find something that has pushed crime down despite the (supposed) upward pressure from computer games.    ...if I could find a group of non swearing teens maybe she would be ok with that.  Non-swearing teen gamers? Good luck with that.  Easily the most foul mouthed group I have ever come across and it's not even clever swearing.  It is more a diarrhea of the mouth kind of swearing.    I suggest you use a gaming headset (built in mic) so she can't hear what's going on.  You can refrain from swearing (so she won't hear you).  And, while you seem to enjoy the shooty games, there are lots of awesome non-shooty/blood magic games out there.   EDIT:  Back in the day (i.e. when computer gaming was still a new thing) there were "boss keys" built in to games.  When the boss came around (or in your case mom/dad) you'd hit the boss key and the game would pause and put up a spreasheet on the screen.  Quite handy that.  Maybe keep MS-Word running in the background with a partially completed paper then ALT-Tab when they come by.  You have to be fast and of course it won't save/pause your game but you do what you can.    So what did [Stuxnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet) target?    Tires are certainly a part of it.  Traction control would be even better (not sure if either has it).  It could be the driver in the black truck is better.  The silver truck spins its wheels, black truck seems to carefully put on power and maintain traction.  Once the silver truck spins its wheels they've pretty much lost.    I don't understand why people like Destiny or other games like it, but obviously lots do.   My theory is there is precious little else for them to play.  The nextgen consoles (at least the PS4/Xbone) have yet to deliver anything really compelling.  There just is not a lot else demanding their time.     Looks like a real life Dr. Seuss character.     i7-930 here and still works like a charm.  I recently replaced my AMD 7970 for a 980 for G-Sync.  Can't decide if I need to update the CPU.  Seems to still get the job done.    I recently bought a 980 for G-Sync but till that used AMD cards.  They all worked great with one minor issue with a Total War game that took the devs months to sort out.  Other than that flawless and game performance was excellent.  But yeah, my last card (7970) would *literally* heat my room in winter (I had to cover up my vents and I live in Chicago so yeah, gets cold here).  Kidjanot.  EDIT:  AMD's points system for playing games that would get you discounts on games and hardware was a joke though.  I play a lot of games and barely racked up points and the "deals" were barely deals at all.  Since it just sort of happened in the background it didn't really matter but it actually pissed me off more than made me happy because it was so much BS.   	135

What the actual fuck dude?   nothing I think, unless you correctly predict which team will be 1st, that's 50 points.   Yes, but that reverse fucked me up, and now I have VoidBoys, NAR and NOTTODAY advancing and being in top4 which is impossible :(   I just need HyperGloryTeam to win vs Wings, and CDEC to win/draw vs Wings and I'll correctly predict top 4.   Odds of that happening?   Ugh...   While we are at it, did anyone pick Root gaming but the game ended up switching to Void Boys because of the bug and vice versa?    Better question is: Why do we have to wait THIS LONG to get cosmetic items?   Ehome won 2-0 over EP, which automatically puts them on first place. EHOME can either lose/win/draw their last game, the outcome won't matter. They are first.   Prepare your cats!   wasn't the game almost closing out? why did they ask so late on it?   Why did they want to remake the game?   Why did they want to remake the game?   why?   nop   65 levels? how come?  So basically, it's the same thing as buying straight up levels?    Since I already have lvl 90 compendium, will purchasing lvl 50 one give me 50 more levels + all default rewards that you get for buying compendium?   Or will I get only +50 levels and rewards for reaching level 100-105 etc.   http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/570/Hidden%20Flower   http://pokit.org/get/img/e7614d1d896c02f7f374a3794455f444.jpg  Is this the one?

Making a chest, or anything for that matter, will get INTO THE GAME EVENTUALLY, how come you don't fucking understand that?   You think that if they make something, and they don't hit that goal, they'll just throw that shit away? Are you fucking mental? IT'LL GET INTO THE GAME EVENTUALLY.   Do you not understand basic logic?    to unlock them then their work would've been for nothing   **nothing**?   alright, I'm done, peace   how about you stop being fucking fanboy and realise that a company such as valve should have had this item prepared long time ago. How about you also use your fucking brain and understand that creating game content of great quality doesn't take 10 months to create? Huh? How about you fucking do that?     there shouldn't be any 'polish' bullshit, we reached our goal, how about they fullfil their 'promise'?   how to get the flame/red one?    Anyone picked Void Boys instead of Root gaming by mistake in predictions?   Valve picks were bugged, so instead of picking Void boys, the picture would show Root gaming and vice versa?    did you get 30 points like a drop that occurs occasionally after the game or ?   you got 30 compendium points by watching on twitch or ingame? did it drop after the game or midway?   **KILLING FLOOR 2** - 11 TF2 / 10 CSGO operation keys!  **KILLING FLOOR 2 DELUXE EDITION** - 12 CSGO / 14 TF2  ADD ME! - **Buying on DEMAND!**  | **CS:GO - Counter Strike: Global Offensive** | 5 keys| https://dispenser.tf/trade/164913/  YOU CAN BUY IT VIA MY DISPENSER, ADD ME, OR SEND ME AN OFFER!

I wouldn't know, I'm waiting for a whole pack to go on sale    only first episode :/   http://steamcommunity.com/id/train_subject9972/inventory/#753_1  Something from my inventory?   will think about it and let you know   what   Cheapest price please, offer below.   No problem, I hope you'll enjoy it!   My review of the game:   This game is what Murdered: Soul Suspect could've been and even more if it had focused on improving its mechanism and graphics.   As a person who expected a lot from Murdered being the fan of the genre itself, I really thought there's nothing else these type of games can improve on. And I'm delighted and happy to say that this game proved me wrong. Not only does this game is stunningly gorgeous in any possible way, it also has that creepy atmosphere that makes you really think about every process you make and things you do in the game.   "This game doesn't hold your hand" - is damn right, and I love how it isn't completely linear. You can explore and find cases however you like, there's no really a perfect order or the right order for that matter. You will end up doing the same thing in the end, and the fact that it's kinda "open world" with few limitations here and there is one of the pros of this game.   For this price range, I'm not sure if a game that's around 4-5+ hours long could satisfy everyones needs, unless you are a fan of detective   mystery games such as myself, but I would definitely consider picking this up as soon as it hits your optimal price range.   Score: 7/10   That's nice. 10x tf2 keys at current price is 19.40.   Killing Floor 2 is 19.99, which is the cheapest amount if you compare it to other ROW regions.   9x chroma 2 keys at current bring it to about 19.08.   Good luck finding it for 10x TF2 keys / 9x CSGO keys, I'm sure there are plenty of people around selling for that price and willing to lose some money. :D     Killing Floor 2 - 10 CSGO chroma 2 keys   oh, alright, thanks for the answer   who's the other GK?   unforgettable?   http://steamcommunity.com/id/train_subject9972/inventory/   Something from there?   steamcommunity.com/id/train_subject9972 something from my inventory?   probably not since he drops the baguette right away   **KILLING FLOOR 2** - 11 TF2 / 10 CSGO operation keys!  **KILLING FLOOR 2 DELUXE EDITION** - 12 CSGO / 14 TF2  ADD ME! - **Buying on DEMAND!**  | **CS:GO - Counter Strike: Global Offensive** | 5 keys| https://dispenser.tf/trade/164913/  YOU CAN BUY IT VIA MY DISPENSER, ADD ME, OR SEND ME AN OFFER!

Are they really THAT bad for your health?   lol?   I have Athlon X4 640 3.0 and 7850 1GB with 8 gigs of RAM. I'm eager to upgrade, and it'll have to be really soon.   Same here, I was thinking about buying that same combo with maybe r9 290x instead of GTX970, but I'm curious if I should actually wait or what?    So basically, I need help with my build. I was thinking of upgrading my PC from Athlon II X4 640 3.0 and 7850 1GB to something more beastly, capable of running nowdays games on high/ultra settings.   My first questions:   **Should I wait for next generation of CPUs by AMD or even INTEL later in the year?**   If I wait, I'll have to endure till the end of the year with this PC that barely runs most of the games nowdays. If I buy a PC however, **will it be somewhat timeproof?**.   Lastly, what would be my optimal pick for PC build? Considering I'm about to buy parts from my country, and it's mad expensive, I have around 1000 to spend.   Given that here, GTX 970 and i5 4690k are 650, what would be the best bang for my buck?   Maybe R9 290 Tripple X or something?   What would you guys recommend overall? I plan on having this computer for at least 3-4 years, will that be possible with this amount of money?  Please help, and sorry for wall of text!   TL;DR Read everything marked with **black**.   Never said I don't like chanting about other team's players. I said I don't like teasing of Stevie G particularly.      he has his few uses  ^^LOL   wait, so to be loyal, I have to really dislike Stevie G.? Are you fucking retarded dude or what?   That defending was even worse than when JT scored.   You judge me if i'm a real fan based of liking Stevie G. or not? I asked you before, and I'll ask you again, are you retarded?   What's funny?   I don't like all this teasing of Steven Gerrard. He's a good player, he didn't deserve it.   doesn't mean anything? I heard it's pretty important for Liverpool    Terry never won a Champions League?   Come on HR I believe in you!   I'll pass, thanks   C.   Is the outcome different if you pick different options?   I've beaten 3 games in the previous week.   **Ryse Son of Rome** - Great game, a bit repetitive,and a bit too short, but I enjoyed it overall, cool story and a fun experience.   **GTA V** - Nothing to say about, a little bit disappointed with the end (maybe it was my fault in the end), but the story, voice acting, characters and everything was so detailed, I really got myself into it and I started caring for every single character. Loved it, fantastic example on how triple A should be made.  **Perils of Man** - Short, but interesting adventure game, with interesting thoughtful story. Although a little bit buggy, if you manage to overcome its flaws, you can really enjoy what it has to offer.   Currently playing:   **Ori and the Blind Forest** - nothing much to say about this game, best $20 spent in a long long time. Fantastic game, with fantastic gameplay mechanics and graphics that  will leave you completely speechless.

 Que?   /u/Trollabot doctechnical   ^What?   /u/Trollabot train_subject9974   I don't think AR 670-1 defines the IPFU's unserviceability.    DA Pam 710-2-2, Supply Support Activity Supply System: Manual Procedures, 30 Sep 98, Glossary, pp. 268-276 defines unservicability as **More inclusive term than damage or destruction. It indicates, in military usage, that the article to which the term is applied is no longer useful for the intended purpose. Damage or destruction may not be involved. The term also indicates property that has deteriorated through use; however, it may include property no longer usable for its original purpose, despite the reason for its condition.**    Technically your pt's aren't unservicable, since they serve their original purpose but they are unpresentable (presentability can be determined by your CO). Unless your NCO argues that the reflective Army logo was a safety thing, in which case rubbing it off would make the shorts unservicable since they don't perform the original purpose.     Bottom line, your NCO/SNCO is gonna fucking win this war. Buy new PT's.      Drunk guy is at a bar pounding drinks and he notices a well dressed young man at the other end of the bar. Every time a female walks by the young man he whispers something in their ear, sometimes they look at him shocked until he says something to soothe them, but the drunk notices that several times the women accompany the young man to a private room in the back of the tavern. The drunk has observed the young man score several times today. Thd drunk thinks to himself, "what line is this man using to get all these girls? It has a pretty high success rate." and stumbles across the room and asks the young man "Shayy, what line are you ushing to get all theshe pretty women". The young man politely explains "whenever a pretty woman walks near me I whisper in her ear, 'Tickle your ass with a feather?' If she agrees, we go to the back and get kinky, on the other hand if she is offended I repeat myself 'typical nasty weather' and she thinks she just misheard me."   The drunk agrees that this is a fine line, and decides to try it before he forgets it. He stumbles out of the bar, summons a cab to drive him home, stumbles into his house where his wife is resting on the couch and propositions her "Shayy honey, can I shtick a feather in your ass?" She looks at him and replies "What did you say you drunk sonofabitch?" To which he replies "Fucking rain".       Not super dirty, but I like it.   A comment about how shitty 9gag is.   Some shower shoes. Gotta love those feet.   People spend a lot of time arguing about just and unjust wars. The way I see it, if you are murdering women, children, and noncombatants or committing war crimes you are fighting an unjust war.    If you are fighting bad guys (The Taliban, Al-Qaida, ISIS, fill-in-the-blank) it may not always be a *wise* war, but that does not mean there is no justice in it.     Its up to the politicians to decide whether we go to war, it is up to the soldiers to fight those wars honorably. We voice our opinions about the wisdom of proposed wars through the ballot box as private citizens, we actively influence the way in which our nation wages war by behaving honorably in our AO's whenever we are sent to war.    Is service inherently honorable?No. If you do shitty and immoral things while in uniform they are no less shitty and immoral. Can service be honorable? Absolutely. Dedicating yourself to making the world a better place and, most importantly, living for the guy to your left and right are totally honorable in my sight.     "Mentee" is a legit word. Protege is also correct. Both are acceptable.        Oh yes, he was a fine fellow.   I don't think it was his lie at all, if I remember correctly Ben Franklin puffed up Von Stueben's credentials to persuade Washington to hire him.   The "Baron" who was not actually a Baron at all, haha!         On fucking point.   That's the same thing SGM said when I charged my cell phone on a SIPR computer... What am I missing here?   I really hope this is a troll.      Nope, the media is gonna elect him "official representative for the Army" and blast his opinions. That is how it usually works.   I am an active duty E-5 considering moving to the Alabama National Guard. I have heard a lot of negative things, but I was just curious what y'alls experiences have been? I am trying to score a job with the railroad in B-ham or maybe something in trucking, and stay in the Guard for a while? Has anyone had a similar experience?   I would love to remove Govt from the picture. As with anything, involving the government with private matters fucks them all up.   I don't waste my time thinking about the sexual preferences of other men. I honestly don't give a shit what any other dude likes in thd bedroom.   I always think /u/slothfactsbot is funny   We all know there are several floating around, which ones are your favorites to run into?   I always think /u/slothfactsbot is funny.   Yeah, I hate drum. Been here 3 years. I am stuck here right now trying to come down on orders.   Outlaw Country.   Because I am country and identify with the themes of hard work, self sufficiency, traditional southern values, and getting drunk   I am at Drum too. Just moved to the CAB from 3rd Brigade.   I don't know what you are referring to here.   We all know there are several floating around, which ones are your favorites to run into?   Another OP who thinks random=original.    Speaking of random, I summon /u/slothfactsbot to bring us some facts about sloths.   Loxley, AL.   I don't have to deal with city people.   Yes, I meant no legal penalty.   Did your hadji commander tell you to post this here?   A lot of what we think is funny hinges on the element surprise. Jokes are all about tricking your brain by ending the story different than you expect (aka delivering the punchline).   What we percieve as cleverness is someone else stimulating our brains by inserting a common reference/relatable shared knowledge in a surprising way (for example when they make a pop culture reference at a time we did not expect a pop culture reference).   It all boils down to brain stimulation through surprise. Of course it is more complex than this,  but that is the eli5 answer.   Take ju-jitsu. Fighting is not an overnight skill, it takes practice.   Afghanistan. I learned about brotherhood, that life is most memorable when shittiest, that the problema we face over here are petty and not worth crying over, and that I don't need half as much stuff as I think I do.   I do support the existence of unions. I said that in my first post. I am all for folks *voluntarily* joining together to bargain for healthcare or anything else. I just do not support using the state to achieve those goals. I also stated I would not join a union because as of yet there are none who want to further my goals.   I oppose abortion because I believe it to be a violation of the nonaggression principle, and therefore the lawful domain of state intervention. I believe the state should punish/prevent acts of aggression, since I believe a fetus to be a human entitled to full human rights, extinguishing their life is an act of aggression.   You are right, my bad. Corrected.   My goals are  1. Deregulation of the markets. Unions advocate for *more* market regulation. I do not support welfare, federal organizations like OSHA, or any other federal market legislation.  2. Total freedom of association. If a business owner does not want to serve or hire someone based on race, religion, or bias, he has that right. Although it is apalling, I believe each individual owns the products of their labor, and can refuse to give those products to anyone for any reason.  3. Many unions support abortion coverage in an employment contract. I do not believe abortions are moral and therefore oppose this.  4. I oppose the state forcing employers to provide healthcare for their employees. While it is moral, and good business practice, the details of an employment contract are for the employee and employer to decide through bargaining the state has no place in the matter.    Unions are fine, but should remain voluntary. Individuals must be free to join and leave a union at will. Forced unionization is an infrigement on the right of voluntary association. There should be no penalty for refusal to join a union.    I would not join a union because there are none whose goals match my own, but if others want to join one it does not bother me.   One important distinction. Progressives and Liberals (in the modern sense) tendto view the world collectively. We view the world through an individualists perspective. My class, race, and cuture do not represent me and I do not represent them. I am my own person, distinct from my class, race, and cultural heritage.    I cannot access the republican sub.   We aren't emotionally charged bleeding hearts who spend every spare moment on deployment opening up about our feelings and political persuasions..   -Soldier.   He was one of only 19 men to win the MOH twice, one of only 2 to win them in separate conflicts. He was an amateur boxer, Marine, fought in the Boxer Rebellion, Banana Wars, and WW1. During the Battle of Belleau Wood in WW1, he is purported to have yelled to the men of his company, Come on, you sons of bitches, do you want to live forever? in order to motivate them to charge the Germans. He was offered the chance to commission as an officer twice, declining both times because he would rather be an outstanding sergeant than just another officer." [This is him rocking both of his MOH's](http://i.imgur.com/aQiOytq.jpg) Seems like one salty-ass motherf*cker.   Apparantly he was one of only 19 men to receive the MOH twice, one of only 2 to receive them in separate conflicts. He was an amateur boxer, Marine, fought in the Boxer Rebellion, Banana Wars, and WW1.    During the Battle of Belleau Wood in WW1, he is purported to have yelled to the men of his company, Come on, you sons of bitches, do you want to live forever? in order to motivate them to charge the Germans.

[This is him rocking both of his MOH's](http://imgur.com/aQiOytq) Seems like one salty-ass motherf*cker.   Edit; changed "win" to "receive"   Please add me to the Republicans.   Why is ending drug prohibition unrealistic? Drug decriminalization and even legalization has been accomplished in many developed nations. If the US is such a haven for liberty and freedom, why can't we do it too?    My end goal would be total legalization. Your body is your own and you alone get to choose what substances your body uses. Realistically I would like to see significant reduction in drug penalties, lower sentences, turn drug crimes into misdemeanors. I would like to cut all funding to national agencies' operations against drugs, especially the DEA.    There is no such thing as stress cards, and never has been.   I would not necessarily be repealing all aspects of the ACA, just the mandate.   1. MEPs is basically just a very long set of examinations, physical, mental, bloodwork, xrays, etc. Once deemed fit it is also where you sign your contract. Basic is tough but simple. It is stressful, drill sergeants will scream at you and get in your face, but as long as you follow basic i structions you will be fine.  2. The cutoff age is 42 for enlistment.  3. Being in the Reserves or National Guard means you go to drill one weekend a month, and two weeks out of the year. Sometimes they deploy and you get active duty pay. Active duty soldiers are on cal 24/7, usually work Mon thru Fri depending on your job.  4. goarmy.com has a list of all possible jobs. Not all of these will be available though. Depending on your ASVAB score and the dates school seats are open.  5. n/a  6. They don't *have* to move with you. If you want to live away from them. You typically stay at one duty station between 3-5 years at a time. As long as you are in the Army you have to move where they tell you to when they tell you to. They will pay for your family to come along and provide accomodations, but if you choose to leave your family behind it is your choice.  7. Yes. When a leader tells you to respond, you respond. No matter how minute or pointless the thing they tell you to do is, you will do it because they own your ass. If you have a temper and a tendency to snap off/talk back to authorith, the drill sergeants in basic willl resolve that issue quickly.    The Army is not for everyone. If you are just looking for benefits, you will be disappointed. There is piles and piles of BS that falls on you the minute you join. At the same time it is rewardinf, enabling, and something you will never forget.   A libertarian supporting government intervention in the markets? Embarrassing.   I am also a Libertarian-Republican. I would offer extreme immigration reform, marriage equality, ending the drug war, stopping NSA spying, and cuts in defense.   In return I would ask for support auditing the Federal Reserve, repealing the Patriot act, a systematic removal of gun control, cutting the IRS drastically, and the repeal of the healthcare mandate.    You should try him, he is perspective broadening and important to the genre. You may not like him, but there is value to his work.   Faulkner.    I am a huge Southern Gothic and Southern Lit fan, but I have read nearly everything Faulkner has written and not liked it.   There are still deployments, some of them combat, some of them more humanitarian. Most folks end up doing overseas tours of some kind whether it is Africa, Afghanistan, or chilling in Guam. There is no way to predict accurately whether you will see combat.     If you are not deployed you will be training to deploy. In and out of the field, big field exercises, going to the range to become more accurate on your weapon etc.   [Long legged guitar pickin man](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0_59br5LAU0) by Johnny Cash and June Carter.    This is how we talk to each other, and we are huge Johnny and June fans.   Yeah.... No.   Not in the NG from the stories I have heard.   Lexington Steele.    Obvious Reasons.   You are just talking about American city folks.    I eat Sheep, Venison, Turkey, Rabbit, Quail, Dove, Pheasent and many others on a very regular basis.        Just because you can put a bunch of random words together does not mean you are funny. More folks need to figure this out.   Adolph.   Something about not preheating his oven properly.   "Free" and "taxpayer funded" are two very different things.   "That dress *did* make your butt look fat!"   They are probably ashamed about it, and probably are using it in an unhealthy way to deal with some other issue or insecurity.  I would try to get them to get help for the core issues/insecurities that cause them to drink.   Red-what?   A lock box to lock your cell phone in.    Obviously the Portal Gun.   Adolf Hitler and Adam Sandler.   I can't really thing of anything. I have a pretty calloused stomach, worn rough by my experiences.    Being politically incorrect.   Army;  They are kids. Kids act like kids. Everyone needs to calm the fuck down. Hypernationalism usually comes from folks who don't have a clue what real sacrifice is all about.     The parent needs to teach their kids about respect, and respecting things other people find valuable. I would say letting your kids run wild on an object others find solemn probably indicates you haven't taught them about respect well enough.    But no, I am not offended.    Freckles.    I love steak in the mornings. Steak and Eggs is my birthday breakfast every year.   For me it will always be [this](http://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)   I will never see a more accurate personification of Satan himself.      Came from a trailer park in South Alabama. I have now achieved a comfortable lifestyle through the military, and look forward to a very comfortable life after I retire (in 16 years)   I can't remember. It has been too long.   Loyalty. Sticking by you when everyone else ditches you.   The reasons I become friends with girls has no corollation to the reasons the males mentioned in your OP became friends with you. The only way you are going to find out the answer to this question is to be direct and ask them.   I become friends with females for the same reasons I become friends with males; I share some common interest or perspective with them and benefit from their presence.    If I want more than friendship with a girl I will be very clear and direct about my desires/intentions.    My perspective is not indicative of the whole male gender though. The males you mention could share my outlook, or they could think totally different. The only way you will find out is to ask..   Its a laser range finder/long range recon system.   Read about it [here](https://www.strategypage.com/military_photos/long_range.aspx)   No, I have not deified anything. The Word is not a divine entity, but is the true Word of the only God. It should be worshipped as the one true revelation of God.    The Holy Spirit has many roles. He reveals the scriptures to those whom he will, he works upon the hearts of men to prepare them to recieve the Word, he impressed the Word upon the hearts/minds of the writers of the Holy Scriptures, etc.   Are you asking if the Holy Spirit can reveal God outside of Scriptures? If so, yes he *can*, it is physically possible, but he does not. God has ordained that his word would be the final and closed revelation of himself.   Super right wing evangelical conservative. Runs with the like of Glenn Beck. Not someone I would associate with.   The direct Word of God. The complete and closed revelation of Himself.   Libertarianism advocates a free and voluntary society wherein each individual has the liberty to behave and act any way they wish as long as they do not aggress against another individual's life, liberty, or property.   Murder their family and leave a note written in blood on their wall that says "you're next".   A bit. Not every girl can rock every hairstyle. i am not a fan of short hair, and I freakin love neon dyed hair.    The same bar of Lava soap I use on my body. Shampoo is overrated.   Sure. A lot of folks have done so it the past. As far as I know it is not against sub rules.   We had/have no endgame. They just want to drag this war out until it no longer makes politicians money. That is my opinion. Just like Vietnam and Korea. No endgame, no good planning, just something that made the politicians look good at the time.   We should have gone in there with the sole purpose of retaliation for their attacks. Shock and awe, obliterate them and their hold, then leave.   Nobody owes you anything.    I was at Forward Operating Base Shank in Eastern Afghanistan.   I think originally the war in Afghanistan was justified, but politicians put their stupid heads into it. It does not take 13 years to win a war. We should have been done a long time ago, it is not our job to build a nation. Iraq was never justified. Saddam was a bad guy, but ISIS is a helluva lot worse. I don't trust politicians, and I don't think they have our best interests in mind. They don't give a shit how many young kids die overseas as long as they can make it look like they died for something. Since Korea we have been doing the same shit, and young American kids have been paying for the politicians records.    That being said, i fought and lived for my brothers. We were not fighting good or decent people, they deserved every bit of firepower we used against them. I don't regret it, I would do it again. I just wish people cared still. I wish folks cared about the guys who died. I wish people would learn that war is costly and should always be a last resort.   Move home to Alabama, buy a few acres and raise sheep.   Because western society is pretty self centered and narcissistic. Folks are taught from a young age that the world revolves around their feelings/emotions, and all that matters is that they are happy all the time.       Lazy motherfuckers.    Whenever it is fitting. I cry when friends die, huge emotional events, etc.    There is nothing wrong with men crying. There is something wrong with anyone crying over petty shit.    Must be a Navy thing, I don't know. We have MWR sponsored boating and sailing for enlisted and officers alike   If he is trying to "hook up on the meat market" he needs to grow the fuck up and stop looking for one night stands.   Haha its a little trailer trash town without a whole lot to see, but I love the place.   I am from Loxley, but we had our party in Dothan.   There is a weird cultural image that a lot of folks have that says a woman who approaches a man is too forward/brash.   They don't add value to my life. I personally feel like they would be a waste of my time. I have hobbies already (gardening, hunting, fishing etc) and I am a voracious reader. There is nothing about video games that appeals to me.       Soldier.     The effects of White Phosphorus on a human being.   At my bachelor party (in Alabama) we smoked cigars, had whiskey tasting, and had some fine steaks.     P. S. Stay away from strip clubs.   His generals were brutal and heartless bastards, he waged war in a brutal way. He was a politically skillfull person. I don't buy the "honest Abe with a big ole heart" persona. He was an imperialist with little respect for the idea of decentralization.   When you fulfill your responsibilities and live for more than self gratification.   Nope, I have yet to get into videogames.   The first time mortars fell from the sky in Afghanistan.    Because they don't just accept the most qualified parents.

If you have interesting experiences and connect with many folks you would be surprised at how many opportunities for female companionship will present themselves.

Tattoos are a strong part of the military tradition. I agree with that. Most military folks (including myself) have several tattoos. That being said, there have to be standards. The Army has no problem if you have tattoos, they just have to follow certain guidelines. The Army will change as the culture changes though.     No, our recruit pool will not grow slim. We are kicking good soldiers out as it is to meet force realignment. For every kid who doesn't meet the minimum enlistment requirements, there are a dozen other who do meet the standards.      You are going to have to face this phobia at some point. Getting your blood drawn isn't an Army thing, it is a life thing.

Don't get in trouble with the law.  3. Don't be a lazy fuck.  That pretty much covers all the bases.   1. What huge problem with tattoos?    2. We already have something similar. Of course you would never wear it under rolled up sleeves because that would look even more unprofessional than some think tattoos look.   Put it in a Roth IRA for retirement. You will be set when you are older.   Me too   Bath and Body Works Sensual Amber. Always has been my favorite.   It is warmer than Fort Drum.   Be a mother fucker.   Have you never stepped foot in the South? We drink gallons of sweet tea a day.   Huge. It is larger than my palm. That green notebook it is sitting on is around the size of a waitress pad.   I will likely never stop having income. I come from a breed of folks who always have a job until they die.
